Three Models of Temporal Consciousness\n1.1 Time and Consciousness\n\nTime and consciousness are interwoven on several levels. From the\nvantage point of ordinary life and common sense, consciousness plainly\nseems to exist in time. When we hear the clock strike twelve,\nour auditory experience of it so doing also occurs at twelve (or at\nmost a few moments later). Watching a 120-minute action movie results\nin a two hour stream of auditory and visual experiences (along with\naccompanying thoughts and feelings), and this stream runs concurrently\nwith the playing of the movie. Quite generally, our conscious states,\nirrespective of their kind or character, seem to occur in the same\ntemporal framework as events in the wider world. But this is by no\nmeans the whole story.\n\nThere are also ways in which time or temporality might be regarded as\nmanifest within consciousness. We can judge the duration of\ntemporal intervals, particularly short ones, with reasonable\naccuracy\u2014an ability that psychologists have investigated in\nconsiderable detail (see Wearden 2016 for an overview). Our episodic\n(or autobiographical) memories supply us with access to our own pasts;\nthanks to such memories our earlier states of consciousness are not\naltogether lost to us: they can be recreated (or relived), albeit\nimperfectly, in our present consciousness. And of course there are\npast-oriented emotions, such as remorse or regret or shame: through\nthese the past can influence our present feelings, often in powerful\nways. While there is no future-directed counterpart of memory, we can\nanticipate future happenings (more or less accurately, more or less\neagerly), and experience future-directed emotions: fear, dread,\nhope\u2014and these too can exert a powerful influence of our present\nstates of consciousness.\n\nThe story is still by no means complete, for temporality is manifest\nin consciousness in a further and more intimate way. In our ordinary\nexperience, over brief intervals, we seem to be directly aware of\ntemporally extended phenomena such as change, persistence and\nsuccession. When we see a friend waving goodbye, do we infer\nthat their arm is moving, on the basis of having observed a motionless\narm occupying a sequence of adjacent spatial location? We do make such\ninferences of this kind: if I see that my neighbour\u2019s dustbin is\nin the middle of the road rather than its usual position on the\npavement, I (rightly) infer that it has been moved. But the case in\nquestion is not at all like this: what we see is simply an arm in\nmotion. (Is it for nothing that cinema is often called \u201cthe\nmoving image\u201d?) The same applies in other sensory modalities.\nWhen listening to a melody, we hear each note giving way to its\nsuccessor; when we hear a sustained violin tone, we hear the\ntone continuing on, from moment to moment. If temporally extended\noccurrences such as these can feature in our perceptual experience, it\nis natural to conclude that our awareness must be capable of embracing\na temporal interval.\n\nWhile this may seem obvious, it can also seem problematic. We can\nremember the past and anticipate the future, but we are only directly\naware of what is present\u2014or so it is natural to suppose. But the\npresent, strictly speaking, is momentary. So, if our awareness is\nconfined to the present, our awareness must itself lack temporal\ndepth. Hence, we are led swiftly to the conclusion that our direct\nawareness cannot possibly encompass phenomena possessing temporal\nextension. We are thus confronted with a conundrum: it seems our\nawareness must extend over time, but it seems it can\u2019t.\n\nIn grappling with this \u201cparadox of temporal awareness\u201d as\nit is sometimes called, different philosophers have proposed quite\ndifferent accounts (or models) of the structure of this form of\ntemporal consciousness. Simplifying somewhat, the most discussed\noptions fall into three main categories:\n\nCinematic Model: our\nexperiences lacks any (or any significant) temporal\nextension\u2014they are akin to static, motion-free\n\u201csnapshots\u201d or \u201cstills\u201d. Our streams of\nconsciousness are composed of continuous successions of these static\nconscious states. In this respect they are analogous to movies, which\n(as displayed) consist of rapid sequences of still images.\nRetentional Model: our\nexperiencing of change and succession occurs within episodes of\nconsciousness which do not themselves possess any (or any significant)\ntemporal extension, but whose contents present (or represent)\ntemporally extended intervals and phenomena. These episodes thus have\na complex structure, comprising momentary phases of immediate\nexperience, along with representations (or retentions) of the\nrecent past. Our streams of consciousness are composed of successions\nof states of this kind.\nExtensional Model: our\nepisodes of experiencing are themselves temporally extended, and are\nthus able to incorporate change and persistence in a quite\nstraightforward way. Our streams of consciousness are composed of\nsuccessions of these extended phases of experience.\n\n\n\n\n\na. Cinematic Model\n\n\n\n\nb. Retentional Model\n\n\n\n\nc. Extensional Model\n\n\nFigure 1.1 The Three Main Conceptions of\nTemporal Consciousness. [An\n extended description of Figure 1.1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nIn his influential writings on these matters William James argued that\nto make sense of our temporal experience we need to distinguish the\nstrict or mathematical present from the experiential\nor specious present: whereas the first is indeed\ndurationless, the second is experienced as possessing a brief\nduration, sufficient to accommodate the change and persistence we find\nin our immediate experience. Proponents of the cinematic model\nmaintain that James was mistaken: to make sense of our temporal\nexperience we don\u2019t need anything resembling an extended\nspecious present. Proponents of the extensional and retentional views\nmaintain that we do need something resembling a specious\npresent, but offer very different accounts of\n it.[1]\n\nAscertaining where the truth lies among the differing accounts of\ntemporal consciousness is interesting in itself. Although most forms\nof experience seemingly feature succession and persistence\u2014even\nthe most primitive forms if James was correct in characterizing infant\nconsciousness as a \u201cblooming, buzzing\nconfusion\u201d\u2014many philosophers have not found it easy to\nunderstand how any form of experience can have such\n features.[2]\n The interest and importance of the debate does not end here, for each\nof the accounts of temporal awareness on offer has significant, and\nvery different, implications for our understanding of the general\nstructure of consciousness. In this entry we will be exploring the\nprincipal features and motivations of the competing accounts, as well\nas their strengths and\n weaknesses.[3]\n1.2 Terminology, Problems and Principles\n\nAlthough proponents of the competing approaches are attempting to make\nsense of our experience of temporally extended phenomena, there are\ndivergences on the issue of how precisely this experience should be\nconstrued and on several related matters.\n\nOne significant divide is between those who believe that temporally\nextended phenomena really do figure in our immediate experience, and\nthose who deny this. To coin some terminology:\n\n\nPhenomeno-temporal Realism (PT-realism,\nhenceforth further abbreviated to realism): change,\nsuccession and persistence can be directly perceived or\napprehended.\n\nPhenomeno-temporal Antirealism\n(PT-antirealism, henceforth further abbreviated to\nantirealism): change, succession and persistence\ncannot be directly perceived or apprehended.\n\n\nThe extensional and retentional models are currently the two most\ninfluential forms of realism, with both approaches being developed in\na variety of different ways. The task facing antirealists is in one\nrespect the easier of the two: unlike their realist counterparts, they\nare under no obligation to provide an intelligible account of how it\nis possible for our consciousness to embrace seemingly temporally\nextended phenomena. But in another respect their task is the more\ndifficult. Antirealists are under an obligation to \u201csave the\n(temporal) phenomena\u201d: they need to supply a credible\nexplanation as to why so many of us find it so natural to say\nwe perceive movement and change if in fact we don\u2019t. After all,\nit does seem perfectly natural to hold that we can see clouds\nmove across the sky, feel water flowing through our fingers and hear\nmelodies. This is the task facing those cinematic\ntheorists\u2014e.g., Chuard (2017)\u2014who hold that we do not\ndirectly perceive change or succession but who also accept that we\nseem to.\n\nRealists generally maintain that it is important to distinguish the\nexperience of succession from a mere succession of\nexperiencings. An experience of succession involves a direct\nexperience of change or persistence; there is no guarantee that a\nsequence of distinct momentary (or very brief) experiences will\nconstitute an experience with this character even if these experiences\noccur successively and belong to the same person. If the experiencing\nof a tone C and a tone D are two entirely separate experiential\nepisodes they won\u2019t jointly constitute an experiencing of the\nsuccession C-being-followed-by-D. An experience of succession\ninvolves a temporal spread of contents being presented\ntogether in consciousness, albeit in the form of a perceived\nsuccession rather than simultaneously.\n\nIn an influential treatment of these topics Izchak Miller (1984)\nsuggests that philosophical thinking on temporal consciousness has\nbeen influenced\u2014overtly or only covertly\u2014by two\nprinciples. Miller calls the first of these the \u201cPrinciple of\nPresentational Concurrence\u201d (PPC), which he formulates thus:\n\n\nThe duration of a content being presented is concurrent with the\nduration of the act of presenting it. That is, the time interval\noccupied by a content which is before the mind is the very same time\ninterval which is occupied by the act of presenting that very content\nbefore the mind. (I. Miller 1984: 107)\n\n\nThe \u201cact-content\u201d conception of the structure of\nconsciousness that Miller\u2019s formulation presupposes is not one\nto which everyone will want to subscribe, but the basic thesis\nencapsulated in PPC looks highly\n plausible.[4]\n If we watch a traffic light change from red to green it is natural to\nthink that we see the red light before we see the green light, and\nthat\u2014more generally\u2014our awareness of these events unfolds\nconcurrently with the events. Of the three conceptions of the nature\nof temporal experience we encountered in\n \u00a71.1\n the extensional model most clearly conforms with PPC\u2014and for\nthat reason has a prima facie plausibility.\n\nMiller\u2019s second principle is less intuitively plausible, at\nleast on first acquaintance. Miller calls it the \u201cPrinciple of\nSimultaneous Awareness\u201d (PSA):\n\n\nNo succession of awarenesses\u2014no matter how close together in\ntime they come\u2014can, by itself, account for an awareness of\nsuccession; it must be the case that an awareness of succession\nderives from simultaneous features of the structure of that awareness.\nFor instance, an awareness of the succession of, say, two tones (or\ntone-qualities) must involve simultaneous awareness of both tones (or\ntone-qualities). (I. Miller 1984: 109)\n\n\nSome elements of Miller\u2019s formulation could be clearer. Phillips\nexpresses the basic idea more succinctly and more clearly:\n\nPSA: If one is aware of a succession or duration, one\nis necessarily aware of it at one moment. (2014b:\n 140)[5]\n\nIf PSA is true our awareness of the traffic light changing from red to\ngreen does not run concurrently with the event itself, it\noccurs at a single moment, and so runs counter to PPC. To the extent\nthat PPC seems intuitively plausible, PSA seems implausible. However\ndespite this\u2014as we shall see in\n \u00a74\u2014an\n impressive number of philosophers and psychologists have rejected PPC\nand subscribed to PSA. Why has the latter principle seemed plausible?\nIn part because it provides an answer to the question raised a moment\nago that many realists have found compelling: \u201cHow does an\nexperience of succession differ from a succession of\nexperiences?\u201d For further discussion of these principles and\ntheir motivations see Dainton (2000: \u00a75.6), Rashbrook (2013a),\nHoerl (2009), and Phillips (2010, 2014b).\n1.3 Dynamics of Consciousness\n\nThere is a further issue which divides realists. In addition to\nespousing different views as to the structures within consciousness\nwhich provide us with temporal experiences, realists also defend a\nrange of different views concerning the character of temporal\nexperience. Think of what it is like to see ripples move across the\nsurface of a pond (or across one\u2019s skin), or an ocean wave\ncrashing on the beach, or the sound of a violin droning on. When we\ncarefully introspect, it becomes apparent that such experiences\npossess an internal dynamic character, an immanent intrinsic directed\nflow, of a distinctive kind. Since introspection also reveals\nthat inner experiences such as mental imagery and bodily sensations\nall possess a flow-like character, there is reason to think this\nspecial form of dynamism is a feature of all forms of temporal\nexperience. Or so some realists urge. Other realists are more\nsceptical in this regard, and deny that experience is distinctively\ndynamic in this sort of way, even if it is dynamic in other ways. We\nthus have a further division to note:\n\nStrong dynamism: some or all forms of consciousness\nare imbued with an intrinsic directional flow-character.\n\nModerate dynamism: we directly experience change,\nsuccession and persistence but our experience does not\npossess the inherent flow-character posited by strong dynamists.\n\nBergson held that consciousness (or dur\u00e9e) is strongly\ndynamic\u2014\u201ccontinual flow \u2026 is the only immediate\ndate of consciousness\u201d (Bergson 1889 [1910: 44]). He took this\ndynamism to be a primitive or irreducible feature of experience,\ndescribing the experience of a shooting star as \u201ca line of\nfire\u201d that is characterized by an \u201cabsolutely indivisible\nsensation of motion or mobility\u201d (1889 [1910:\n 111\u20132])[6]\n In stressing the process-like character of perceptual experience\nSoteriou (2013) approvingly cites O\u2019Shaughnessy, whose\ncommitment to strong dynamism is plain:\n\n\n[characteristically] the contents of experience are in flux, and\nnecessarily experience itself is in flux, being essentially occurrent\nin nature \u2026 [i]t is not the mere existence of flux [\u2026]\nin the case of experience that is distinctive: it is the\nnecessity of flux. (O\u2019Shaughnessy 2000: 43)\n\n\nIn his Stream of Consciousness (2000) Dainton maintains that\nintrinsic flow and \u201cdynamic patterning\u201d are features of\nour temporal experience, and he takes these features to be as\nprimitive as synchronic phenomenal unity. Torrengo (2017) is also\ncommitted to strong dynamism. He too thinks that all experiences\npossess a flow-like character, a character that is irreducible to\nrepresentational properties of any\n kind.[7]\n1.4 Methodological Controversies\n\nPhilosophers interested in uncovering the temporal properties of\nconsciousness have often found inspiration in scientific findings.\nRecent discussions have featured a wide range of perceptual illusions\nuncovered by psychologists very prominently\u2014in several\nmuch-discussed works Daniel Dennett (1991, Dennett & Kinsbourne\n1992) drew the attention of philosophers to a number of\nexperiments where (seemingly) what we perceive is affected by stimuli\nwhich lie in the future. In his ground-breaking chapter on the\nexperience of time in The Principles of Psychology (1890)\nWilliam James spends much of his time relating relevant work carried\nout by German psychologists such as Exner, Helmolz and Wundt in the\npreceding decades. As a comparatively new science psychology was just\ngetting started in the nineteenth century, but back in 1689 we find\nLocke appealing to proto-scientific data when discussing our\nexperience of duration in his Essay, where Locke points out\nthat objects cannot be seen if they move fast enough (e.g., cannon\nballs), and that a glowing piece of coal appears as a circle when spun\nquickly.\n\nThe question of the extent to which philosophical discussions of\ntemporal experience should be influenced by science is itself a source\nof controversy. Lee recommends a hard-line science-oriented\nmethodological stance:\n\n\nMy view is that the most powerful considerations in this area have to\ndo with the ways in which temporal information is processed in the\nbrain, so that ultimately what is at stake depends on empirical\nconsiderations of a quite general kind. [\u2026] It is worth noting\nat the offset that because I adopt this \u201cbottom-up\u201d\nmethodology, my approach contrasts quite strongly with certain other\nauthors such as Dainton (2000) who argues for views in this area more\non the basis of phenomenological than empirical considerations. (Lee\n2014a: 2)\n\n\nIn the introduction to his Stream of Consciousness Dainton\n(2000) willingly concedes that in attempting to understand\nexperiential unity and continuity his own approach will be exclusively\nphenomenological. He argues that his approach is justified because\nthere exist important experiential structures that are in fact\naccessible to introspection, and we currently have no other way of\naccessing these features. Neuroscience may one day be in a position to\nassist but significant advances will need to be made\u2014indeed\nDainton suggests in\n\n\nsituations in which the phenomenological data conflict with accepted\nscience may well provide valuable clues as to how the relevant science\nmight be revised and improved. (2000: 23).\n\n\nKon and Miller (2015) advocate a middle way between Dainton\u2019s\n\u201ctop-down\u201d phenomenological approach and Lee\u2019s\n\u201cbottom-up\u201d approach rooted in neuroscience. They suggest\nthat advances in our understanding of temporal experience will require\nus to successfully integrate armchair analysis and empirical\nevidence:\n\n\nwe foresee that empirical evidence may significantly modify classic\nmodels these models are still of use: they offer a starting point for\nempirical enquiry by placing key features of our experience into\ncoherent models. Plus, they offer general frameworks in which\nparticular empirical models may be slotted and that potentially have\ntestable consequences. (2015: 215)\n\n\nIf temporal illusions have played a significant role in recent debates\nbut the same cannot be said of the general neuroscientific theories of\nconsciousness\u2014theories which purport to identify the neural\nbasis of consciousness and (more ambitiously) explain how and why\nneural processes produce experiences in all its forms. It is far from\nbeing the case that general theories of this sort do not exist, or are\neven thin on the ground\u2014see Wu (2018) for an introduction to\nseveral. Why have philosophers interested in temporal experience paid\ncomparatively little attention to these theories? Kent and\nWittmann (2021) propose an answer: to a surprising extent the main\ngeneral theories of how consciousness relates to the brain make no\nattempt to explain or accommodate experienced\nsuccession, at most they can explain experienced\nsimultaneity as it features in the briefest of conscious\nepisodes. Northoff and Lamme (2020) review eight leading\nneuroscientific theories of consciousness: global neuronal workspace\ntheory (GNWT), predictive coding theory (PCT), embodied theory (EB),\ntemporospatial theory of consciousness (TTC), integrated information\ntheory (IIT), recurrent processing theory (RPT), synchrony theory (ST)\nand higher-order thought theory (HOT). The majority of these, Kent and\nWittmann argue, focus exclusively on processes in the sub-300 msec\nrange, the sorts of neural processes that are generally thought to\ngive rise to momentary experiences of simultaneity. These leading\ntheories have nothing to say about neural processes occurring over\nlonger intervals, from 300 msec to 3 seconds or more, that it is\nplausible to suppose will be underlie experiences of change and\nsuccession. Only RPT and Northoff\u2019s own TTC offer anything\ndifferent: these theories hold that experienced succession depends on\noscillatory neural process that extend over significant periods of\ntime.\n\nIf Kent and Wittmann are right it\u2019s obvious why general\nneuroscientific theories have\u2014thus far at least\u2014had so\nlittle impact on the philosophical debates. Whereas the latter offer\ncompeting accounts of the experience of temporally extended phenomena\nseemingly stretching over intervals of time, the neuroscientific\ntheories have largely confined themselves to a single experienced\nmoment. If neuroscience starts to move beyond its current very narrow\ntemporal focus its impact will very likely begin to increase.\n\nThese considerations do not mean that it is impossible for the\nphilosophical debates to impact on neuroscience. To focus on just one\nexample, the current incarnation of IIT is quite explicit regarding\nthe narrow temporal confines of consciousness:\n\n\n\u2026 my experience flows at a particular speed\u2014each\nexperience encompassing a hundred milliseconds or so\u2014but I am\nnot having an experience that encompasses just a few milliseconds or\nhours. (Tononi & Koch 2015: 6)\n\n\nSince these brief episodes are discrete and non-overlapping our\nconsciousness is less continuous than commonly thought:\n\n\nAccordingly, the seemingly continuous \u201cstream\u201d of\nconsciousness would actually be constituted by a discrete succession\nof \u201csnapshots\u201d in line with some psychophysical evidence.\n(2015: 16)\n\n\nIn effect Tononi and Koch are committing IIT to a version of the\ncinematic model outlined earlier. This model does have its proponents,\nso this in itself is not problematic. What is more puzzling, as\nSinghal, Mudumba and Srinivasan (2022) point out is that IIT\ndistinguishes itself from other neuroscientific approaches by taking\nphenomenology very seriously indeed. Yet the cinematic model is widely\ntaken to be the most phenomenologically implausible of the leading\ntheories of temporal experience\u2014most of its proponents agree\nthat our ordinary consciousness seems to be deeply continuous. IIT is\ndistinctive by virtue of the singular importance it grants to the\nunity of consciousness, but it makes no attempt to\naccommodate the fact (as many see it) that the unity of consciousness\nextends through time as well as existing at a time. To render IIT\nmaximally phenomenologically plausible these same authors recommend\nthis addition to IIT\u2019s current axioms:\n\n\nexperience always occurs to us as a temporal whole, i.e. experience\nalways has an extension, is continuous and has an inherent direction\nthat is asymmetric. (2022: 14)\n\n\nIf future versions of IIT were to include an axiom along these lines\nit would be an interesting example of phenomenology influencing the\ndevelopment of a neuroscientific theory.\n2. Some Historical Episodes\n2.1 William James\n\nIn the Anglophone philosophical world over the past century or so\nWilliam James\u2019 \u201cThe Perception of Time\u201d, chapter 15\nof his classic The Principles of Psychology (1890) has been\nparticularly influential. In the chapter James introduces readers to\nrelevant experimental work as well as more philosophical reflections.\nIt was thanks to James\u2019 discussion that \u201cthe specious\npresent\u201d entered the vocabulary of both philosophers and\npsychologists. James gives E.R. Clay credit both for the term and for\nrecognizing that the \u201csensible present\u201d has duration; he\nquotes him thus:\n\n\nThe relation of experience to time has not been profoundly studied.\nIts objects are given as being of the present, but the part of time\nreferred to by the datum is a very different thing from the\nconterminous of the past and the future which philosophy denotes by\nthe name Present. The present to which the datum refers is really a\npart of the past\u2014a recent past\u2014delusively given as being a\ntime that intervenes between the past and the future. Let it be named\nthe specious present, and let the past, that is given as being the\npast, be known as the obvious past. All the notes of a bar of a song\nseem to the listener to be contained in the present. All the changes\nof place of a meteor seem to the beholder to be contained in the\npresent. At the instant of the termination of such series, no part of\nthe time measured by them seems to be a past. (James 1890:\n 609)[8]\n\n\nJames goes on:\n\n\nthe original paragon and prototype of all conceived times is the\nspecious present, the short duration of which we are immediately and\nincessantly sensible. (1890: 631)\n\n\nIn another formulation he enters into more detail, and says something\nabout what this short duration contains:\n\n\nThe unit of composition of our perception of time is a duration, with\na bow and a stern, as it were\u2014a rearward\u2014and a\nforward-looking end. It is only as parts of this duration-block that\nthe relation of succession of one end to the other is perceived. We do\nnot first feel one end and then feel the other after it, and from the\nperception of the succession infer an interval of time between, but we\nseem to feel the interval of time as a whole, with its two ends\nembedded in it. (1890: 609\u201310)\n\n\nIn the same chapter of the Principles James also writes:\n\n\nIts content is in a constant flux, events dawning into its\nforward end as fast as they fade out of its rearward one \u2026\nMeanwhile, the specious present, the intuited duration, stands\npermanent, like the rainbow on the waterfall, with its own quality\nunchanged by the events that stream through it. (1890: 630)\n\n\nJames clearly believed that there is an unvarying structure\nor mechanism underlying our temporal awareness, as did\nHusserl after him. If this is right, and if (as many believe)\nconsciousness is essentially temporal, then this structure (or\nmechanism) is an essential component of consciousness itself, in all\nits forms.\n\nJames is well-known for emphasizing the continuity of\nexperience\n\n\nConsciousness, then, does not appear to itself as chopped up into\nbits. Such words as \u201cchain\u201d or \u201ctrain\u201d do not\ndescribe it fitly \u2026 It is nothing jointed, it flows. A\n\u201criver\u201d or a \u201cstream\u201d are the metaphors by\nwhich it is naturally described (1890: 239)\n\n\nand James\u2019 stream metaphor strikes many as\n apt.[9]\n2.2 Locke, Hume and Reid\n\nIf the nineteenth century saw a surge in interest in\ntime-consciousness due to discoveries in a range of different\nfields\u2014see Canales (2009) for more of the story\u2014an\ninterest in these questions dates back far earlier. Saint\nAugustine\u2019s labours in Book XI of the Confessions led\nhim to espouse a position that is at least highly suggestive of a\nversion of the cinematic conception outlined in\n \u00a71.\n Augustine subscribed to the doctrine of presentism (as it\nhas latterly become known), i.e., he held that only what is present is\nreal:\n\n\nWhat now is clear and plain is, that neither things to come nor past\nare. Nor is it properly said, \u201cthere be three times, past\npresent and to come:\u201d yet perchance it might be properly said,\n\u201cthere be three times: a present of things past, a present of\nthings present, and a present of things future\u201d. For these three\ndo exist in some sort, in the soul, but otherwhere do I not see them;\npresent of things past, memory; present of things present, sight;\npresent of things future, expectation. (Confessions, bk XI,\nch XX, sect 26)\n\n\nSince for Augustine it was also clear that the present must be\nentirely without duration, and that our perception is restricted to\nwhat is present\u2014\u201cthat only can be seen, which is\u201d\n(bk XI, ch XVIII, sect 24)\u2014we are led swiftly to the conclusion\nthat we can perceive or experience only what is contained in a\nmomentary present.\n\nSince we evidently possess concepts of persistence,\nsuccession and suchlike, one would expect philosophers who believe\nthat our basic concepts derive their content from the content of our\nimmediate experience\u2014philosophers such as Locke and\nHume\u2014would incline in the direction of\n realism.[10]\n And generally speaking, albeit with certain complications, this is\nwhat we find. In the Essay (1689) Locke writes:\n\n\nIt is evident to anyone who will but observe what passes in his own\nmind, that there is a train of ideas which constantly succeed one\nanother in his understanding, as long as he is awake. Reflection on\nthese appearances of several ideas one after another in our minds, is\nthat which furnishes us with the idea of succession: and the distance\nbetween any parts of that succession, or between the appearance of any\ntwo ideas in our minds, is what we call duration. (Chapter XIV, 3)\n\n\nLike Locke, Hume believed that our conception of time is derived from\nour experience of the succession of our perceptions. In Book 1, Part\nII(\u00a73) of his Treatise (1739) Hume writes:\n\n\n\u2026 time cannot make its appearance to the mind, either alone, or\nattended with a steady unchangeable object, but is always discovered\nby some perceivable succession of changeable objects.\n(Treatise bk 1, pt 2, \u00a73 [1888: 35])\n\n\u2026 Five notes played on a flute give us the impression and idea\nof time; though time be not a sixth impression, which presents itself\nto the hearing or any other of the senses. [the mind] only takes\nnotice of the manner, in which the different sounds make the\nappearance \u2026 ([1888: 36])\n\n\u2026 the indivisible moments of time must be filled with some real\nobject or existence, whose succession forms the duration, and makes it\nconceivable by the mind. ([1888: 39])\n\n\nAlthough Hume agrees with Locke over the origin of our concept of\nsuccession, what he says about duration sits uneasily with\nLocke\u2019s contention that we arrive at the latter concept by\nobserving the distances between impressions. For Hume\n\n\nthe idea of duration is always derived from a succession of changeable\nobjects, and can never be conveyed to the mind by any thing steadfast\nand unchangeable. ([1888: 37])\n\n\nSince a period of (total) silence between the hearing of two sounds\nwould not itself contain any change or succession\u2014at least of an\nauditory kind\u2014the concept of duration cannot be derived from\nthis period of silence.\n\nFor Hume the fundamental ingredients of our streams of consciousness\nare momentary (durationless) experiences occupying \u201cinvisible\nmoments\u201d of time. If we were conscious of nothing beyond these\ndurationless episodes is not obvious how we could experience\nsuccession. But Hume also held that we apprehend the way\n(\u201cmanner\u201d) momentary perceptions are arranged or\norganized, and to these \u201ccompound impressions\u201d there are\ncorresponding \u201ccompound ideas\u201d. As Lorne Falkenstein\ninterprets Hume, compound ideas are themselves extended in time:\n\n\n[Hume] takes ideas to be objects in their own right, that represent\nsomething else by resembling it. \u2026 An idea of time represents\ntime by being itself extended in time. (Falkenstein 1997: 193)\n\n\nIf ideas of succession are themselves temporally extended, was Hume an\nearly advocate of extensionalism? For Adrian Bardon the answer is\nclear and in the affirmative: in the Treatise\n\n\nHume articulates an extensionalist account of our perception of space\nand time\u2014an almost entirely disregarded account that really\nought to be the locus classicus for extensionalism. (2019:\n 468)[11]\n\n\nIn his Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man (1785,\nhenceforth EIP) Thomas Reid questioned some of Locke\u2019s claims.\nFor Locke succession is a more basic concept than duration\u2014since\nwe arrive at the concept of duration by reflecting on the distances\nbetween parts of successions\u2014but Reid argues the reverse is the\ncase. For a succession to exist at all, its parts\u2014either\nparticular impressions or the intervals between them\u2014must\nthemselves already have duration: for if these parts were all entirely\nlacking in duration, we would be dealing with a purely momentary\nphenomenon, and hence something which could not contain any kind of\nsuccession. Hence succession presupposes duration, and not vice-versa.\nMoreover, Reid held that our direct awareness is incapable of spanning\neven a brief temporal interval: \u201cConsciousness, and every kind\nof thought, is transient and momentary, and has no continued\nexistence\u201d (EIP: III.6, p. 336). If our consciousness is\ninstantaneous and transient it is difficult to see how we could ever\nbe conscious of succession, and this is the stance Reid adopts:\n\n\nIt may here be observed that, if we speak strictly and\nphilosophically, no kind of succession can be an object either of the\nsenses or of consciousness; because the operations of both are\nconfined to the present point of time, and there can be no succession\nin a point of time; and on that account the motion of a body, which is\na successive change of place, could not be observed by the senses\nalone without the aid of memory. (EIP: III.5, pp. 325\u2013326)\n\n\nSince the claim that we are immediately aware only of what is present\ncan seem common sense of the plainest sort, it is not surprising to\nfind Reid endorsing it. Reid recognizes that it seems equally\ncommonsensical to say that we see bodies move\u2014after\nall, we often talk in such terms: e.g., \u201cI saw her waving her\narm\u201d. In response he argues that such talk is perfectly\nlegitimate, provided it is construed in loose or popular sense, and\nnot taken strictly and\n literally.[12]\n See Levanon (2016a) for a more detailed analysis of Reid\u2019s\nviews\u2014and his criticisms of Locke.\n2.3 Kant and Bergson\n\nIn the course of his elaboration of transcendental idealism in the\nCritique of Pure Reason (1787) Kant made a number of claims\nthat would influence subsequent debates on temporal experience. These\nare not always easy to interpret\u2014for useful introductions see\nDunlop (2017) and Bardon (2019). For present purpose this passage in\n\u201cThe Synthesis of Reproduction in Imagination\u201d from the\nfirst Critique is particularly relevant:\n\n\nWhen I seek to draw a line in thought, or to think of the time from\none noon to another, or even to represent to myself some particular\nnumber, obviously the various manifold representations that are\ninvolved must be apprehended by me in thought one after the other. But\nif I were always to drop out of thought the preceding representations\n(the first parts of the line, the antecedent parts of the time period,\nor the units in the order represented), and did not reproduce them\nwhile advancing to those which follow, a complete representation would\nnever be obtained: none of the above-mentioned thoughts, not even the\npurest and most elementary representations of space and time, could\narise. \u2026. the reproductive synthesis of the imagination is to\nbe counted as among the transcendental acts of the mind. We shall\ntherefore entitle this faculty the transcendental faculty of\nimagination. (A102 [1980: 133])\n\n\nAnyone who holds that our sensory experience consists of nothing more\nthan a succession of momentary snapshots faces the problem of\nexplaining why we seem to be aware of duration and succession. Kant\nheld that our sensory experience does have this snapshot-like\ncharacter and solves the resulting problem by offering a richer\naccount of the momentary states. In the visual case, momentary\nepisodes of visual experiencing are accompanied by representations of\nrecently experienced visual contents. More generally, these\nrepresentations allow us to be aware that our presently occurring\nexperience is a part of an ongoing process.\n\nMore needs to be said, but Kant supplies at least the beginnings of\none plausible-looking account of how it might be possible for us to be\naware of change and succession in the way we seem to be, and it is an\napproach that can be developed independently of Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental idealism\u2014and its commitment to the unreality of\ntime. The \u201cretentional\u201d approach (recalling the\nterminology of\n \u00a71.1)\n soon found advocates, and is comparatively commonplace by the end of\nthe nineteenth century.\n\nIf we move onward a century we encounter Henri Bergson, a philosopher\nwho placed a highly dynamic form of temporal experience right at the\ncentre of his philosophy. As Canales (2015) vividly demonstrates, at\nthe beginning of the twentieth century Bergson\u2019s writings on\ntime and consciousness had considerable influence on his\ncontemporaries, both within the philosophical world and beyond. In his\nTime and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of\nConsciousness (1889 [1910]) Bergson began his campaign against\nthe \u201cspatializing\u201d of time, and in this campaign the\nconcept of duration (or dur\u00e9e) plays a key\nrole. At least in his earlier writings, this concept applies to time\nas it is featured in our immediate experience. For Bergson,\ndur\u00e9e is a continuous dynamic experiential flow,\nimmeasurable and unquantifiable\u2014the \u201cceaselessly seething\nsurd at the heart of things\u201d, in Barrett\u2019s words (Gale\n1968: 373). As such it is radically unlike the static conception of\ntime as a manifold of mere locations to be found in the scientific\nconception of the world, whether Newtonian or Einsteinian.\n\n\nPure duration is the form which the succession of our conscious states\nassumes when our ego lets itself live,when it refrains from\nseparating its present state from its former states \u2026 We can\nthus conceive of succession without distinction, and think of it as a\nmutual penetration, an interconnexion and organization of elements,\neach one of which represents the whole, and cannot be distinguished or\nisolated from it except by abstract thought. (Bergson 1889 [1910:\n100\u2013101])\n\n\nMany of Bergson\u2019s characterizations of dur\u00e9e are\nnegative: he tells us a good deal about what it is not, but\ncomparatively little about what it actually is. While this can\nsometimes be frustrating, there is a rationale for it: Bergson held\nthat any attempt to conceptualize the flux of consciousness could\nsucceed only at the cost of distorting the phenomena\u2014a doctrine\nwhich influenced William James in his later years\u2014for more on\nthis see Dainton (2017a, 2022) and Dolev (2022).\n\nIn later works, such as Matter and Memory Bergson suggested\nthat primitive forms of dur\u00e9e can be found in all\nmaterial things, even the simplest particles and fields. If so,\ntemporal experience is ubiquitous, and there is a flowing dynamism at\nthe heart of literally everything. For more on Bergson\u2019s\nconception of the nature of matter see \u010capek (1971) and Sinclair\n(2019).\n\nBergson may have been influential during the first decades of the\ntwentieth century but not everyone was convinced of the fundamental\ncorrectness of his metaphysical and phenomenological claims\u2014even\nin the Francophone philosophical world of the period. In his\nIntuition of the Instant (1932) Gaston Bachelard launched a\nradical assault on Bergson\u2019s account of the temporality of\nconsciousness and the temporality of the world. For Bergson the static\ndurationless instant of mathematics and physics is an abstraction to\nwhich nothing in concrete reality corresponds\u2014reality is\nessentially extended and flowing. The position Bachelard defends is\ndiametrically opposed to Bergson\u2019s:\n\n\nTime alone has but one reality: the reality of the instant. Otherwise\nput, time is a reality confined to the instant and suspended between\ntwo voids. Although time will no doubt be reborn, it must first die.\nIt cannot transport its being from one instant to another in order to\nforge a duration. (Bachelard 1932 [2013: 6])\n\n\u2026 time is the instant, and it is the present instant that bears\nthe full weight of temporality. The past is as empty as the future.\nThe future is as dead as the past. The instant holds no duration at\nits core; it does not thrust a force in one direction or another. It\ndoes not have two faces. It is whole and alone. (1932 [2013: 28])\n\n\nBergson complained that conceiving of the continuity of experience in\nmathematical terms reduces experience to a \u201cdust of\ninstants\u201d. Bachelard responds thus:\n\n\nTime is noticed solely through instants; duration \u2026 is felt\nsolely through instants. Duration is a dust cloud of instants or,\nbetter yet, a group of points organized more or less coherently by a\nphenomenon of perspective. (1932 [2013: 19])\n\n\nWhile Bergson argued that the cinematic conception of the stream of\nconsciousness is fundamentally wrong, for Bachelard this conception is\nessentially correct\u2014and as we shall now see, he is not alone in\nthis.\n3. Cinematic Approaches\n3.1 Streams and Stills\n\nWhen it comes to explaining the temporal structure of our\nconsciousness the account offered by the cinematic theorist is\nappealingly straightforward. On a straightforward version of this\nview, a typical stream of consciousness consists of a close-packed\ncontinuum of momentary (or very brief) phases. Although the contents\nof these phases are themselves momentary\u2014they do not present\nmotion or change, they are akin to static snapshots. But their\noccurrence in rapid succession succeeds in generating all the change,\nsuccession and motion we find in our experience. Or so the cinematic\ntheorist maintains: on their view nothing more is required. The basic\nfeatures of the model are depicted in\n Figure 3.1.\n On the left we see a punctual beam of awareness, the smooth, steady\nadvance of which generates a sequence of momentary snapshot-like\ncontents (of a falling object, in this instance), only a small\nselection of which is shown on the right.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1 The Cinematic Model. [An\n extended description of Figure 3.1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nAs we saw earlier, this approach can be traced back as far as St.\nAugustine and was later advocated by Reid, and more recently by\nBachelard. Phillipe Chuard (2011, 2017, 2020) is a contemporary\ndefender of the view, calling it the \u201csnapshot\ntheory\u201d:\n\n\n\u2026 the snapshot theorist argues, the phenomenology we seem to\nintrospect while enjoying successive experiential states not only\nsupervenes upon, but reduces to, those features of\nsuccessions just listed: the experiential properties of snapshots,\ntheir temporal arrangement, the gradual transitions in their\nsuccessive contents, our memories of previous experiences, and\ninability to detect small gaps and jumps, all contribute to what\nit\u2019s like to enjoy the sort of phenomenology associated with\nputative temporal experiences. (Chuard 2017: 125)\n\n\nIn\n \u00a71.2\n a distinction was drawn between realists and anti-realists, with\nrealists holding that change and succession can be directly perceived\nand anti-realists maintaining that it cannot. Chuard denies that\nchange can be directly apprehended, putting him in the antirealist\ncamp. But he also accepts that we seem to directly experience\nchange\u2014so realism appears to be true, even if it\nisn\u2019t.\n\nTo be clear, the snapshot view isn\u2019t trying to explain how we\ndo, in fact, have temporal experience. We don\u2019t, the snapshot\ntheorist surmises. Rather, the view aims to explain what it is like to\ngo through successions of very short conscious experiential states, to\nthen point out how the phenomenology thus accounted for seems\nindiscriminable from the phenomenology associated with the temporal\nexperience we allegedly enjoy. Thus, the snapshot view doesn\u2019t\nreject the phenomenological appearances, quite the contrary. It aims\nto explain them without liberally assuming that such experiences must\nbe taken entirely at face value, as revealing the metaphysical\nstructure of our streams of consciousness. (Chuard 2017:\n 126)[13]\n\nCritics of the cinematic theory are generally of the view that James\nwas correct when he drew a sharp distinction between a mere succession\nof experiences and an experience of succession, and since the\ncinematic theorist is providing us with no more than the former it\ncannot deliver an adequate account of the latter. Dainton (2000:\n\u00a75.5; 2008b: 57) invites us to imagine a group of five people\nstanding in line with their eyes closed, but directed at a nearby\ntennis game. If each of these people opens their eyes momentarily\nbefore closing them again we have a succession of five experiences,\neach revealing the on-court action at a particular moment. It seems\nclear that in this case there is nothing resembling an experience of\nsuccession: all each person sees is a momentary still image, and these\nmomentary states are completely isolated from one another\nexperientially. There is, Dainton suggests, a huge difference between\nthis sequence of experiences and our own streams of consciousness, but\nsince the cinematic theory fragments consciousness in an analogous way\nit is deeply implausible\n phenomenologically.[14]\n\nAs for how sequences of momentary static snapshots can give rise to\nexperiences with seemingly dynamic contents Reid and Chuard\nboth hold that memory plays an important role. In Reid\u2019s\nwords:\n\n\nIt is by memory that we have an immediate knowledge of things past:\nThe senses give us information of things only as they exist in the\npresent moment; and this information, if it were not preserved by\nmemory, would vanish instantly, and leave us as ignorant as if it had\nnever been. (EIP: III.1, p. 303)\n\n\nBut is memory enough? Phenomenologically there is an obvious\ndifference between perceptual experience and experiential memories:\nthe latter are far less detailed and far less vibrant than the former.\nGiven this, it is not obvious that combinations of instantaneous\nperceptual experiences and memories could provide us with the sorts of\nexperiences of change we actually enjoy: successions of experiences,\nyes; experiences of succession, no. For further discussion of appeals\nto memory see Dainton (2000: \u00a75.4) and Phillips (2010:\n\u00a75).\n\nWhat of the cinematic analogy itself? It is well known that rapid\nsuccessions of static images can result in experiences of\nmotion. The images shown on a TV or cinema screen are static\nsnapshots, but evidently, they are perceived as dynamic: objects on a\ncinema screen are seen to move as smoothly and continuously as their\nreal-life counterparts. This phenomenon\u2014known as \u201cillusory\nmotion\u201d or \u201cthe phi phenomenon\u201d was first explored\nin the nineteenth century by Exner, and has been much-studied since\nthen (not surprisingly, since it underpins televisual industries). But\nwhile it is real enough, the phi phenomenon is of little assistance to\nthe cinematic theorist. What the latter needs is an account of how\nsuccessions of momentary conscious states, each possessing\nentirely static contents, can give rise to the experience of motion.\nStatic images are indeed being displayed on a cinema screen while we\nview a movie, but not only are these onscreen stills not themselves\nexperiences, they do not register in our visual experience as\nstatic images: what we actually seem to see onscreen are objects\nin motion.\n\nIn the scientific literature the hypothesis that perceptual experience\ncomes packaged in discrete sub-second \u201cframes\u201d possessing\nstatic contents has been defended on a number of occasions. White\n(2018) undertakes a detailed survey of the relevant work in psychology\nand neuroscience. White\u2019s verdict is that the discrete frames\nhypothesis has not yet been decisively refuted, but it is seriously\nproblematic on a number of fronts.\n\nThe available evidence does not provide consistent support for any\nspecific duration for frames, and perceptual processes display a\nflexibility that is not readily reconcilable with the frame\nhypothesis. There are also\n\n\nproblems concerning the definition of frames, the need for\ninformational connections between frames, the means by which\nboundaries between frames are established. (White 2018: 98)\n\n3.2 Dynamic Snapshots\n\nCinematic theorists would be on stronger ground if they could supply a\nplausible explanation as to why we believe we perceive motion\n(and more generally, change) if in fact we do not. Le Poidevin (2007:\n88\u201392) tentatively forwards a promising hypothesis. As Aristotle\nnoted, if you stare at a waterfall for a short period, and then turn\nyour gaze to the bank beside it, you will see part of the bank\n(seemingly) start to move in an upwards direction. This phenomenon is\ncommonly called \u201cthe waterfall illusion\u201d (or motion\naftereffect), and the illusory motion is of an intriguing sort:\nalthough parts of the bank seem to flow upward, they do so without\nseeming to change their location with respect to the rest of the\nbank.\n\nAs for an explanation of what is going on in such cases, Le Poidevin\n(following Richard Gregory) suggests that perhaps we can discern here\nthe workings of two distinct neural mechanisms. One\n\n\nregisters what we might call \u201cpure motion\u201d, i.e., gives\nrise to the impression of motion without any associated sense of\nchange of position. (2007: 89)\n\n\nA second system, relying on short-term memory, tracks and compares the\nalterations in location over time. This second system is not concerned\nwith telling us about presently occurring motions, rather it gives\nrise to the sense that objects have changed their positions relative\nto one another. Hence Le Poidevin\u2019s proposal: perhaps our\nordinary experience of motion does, after all, consist of nothing but\nmomentary static snapshots but these momentary experiences\nseem dynamic thanks to the activation of the \u201cpure\nmotion\u201d mechanism in our visual system.\n\nThis is a more promising line for the cinematic theorist to take, and\nit has recently been endorsed by Arstila (2018), and also been taken\nup by Prosser, where pure motion plays an important role in his\ndynamic snapshot theory:\n\n\n\u2026 it is a \u201csnapshot\u201d theory because it accounts for\nthe experience of motion without appeal to a specious present, but it\nis very different from the cinematic or \u201cstatic snapshot\u201d\ntheory. I agree with those who hold that the latter theory cannot\nadequately account for the phenomenology of motion experience. (2017:\n149, see also Prosser 2016: \u00a75.4)\n\n\nThis supposedly dynamic version of the cinematic view may be more\npromising than the static alternative, but it has also come under fire\nfrom a number of directions. McKenna argues thus:\n\n\nFor the experienced illusory object \u2026 to appear static in\nspace, but with motion-like properties, it must exhibit persistence\nover some length of time. temporality is inescapable; events continue\nto succeed one another over time, even if the content remains the\nsame. (2021: \u00a76)\n\n\nShardlow makes a similar complaint:\n\n\nContrary to what Prosser and Arstila suggest, it simply does not\nfollow that the experience of motion is not in and of itself something\nwith a fundamentally temporally extended phenomenology, and that\nmotion/change as it is experienced seems processive\u2026. (2019:\n745)\n\n\nIt may well be a mistake to focus exclusively on the case of vision:\nafter all, in addition to being seen, change can be heard, smelt,\ntasted, felt in bodily sensations, remembered, imagined and thought\nabout. Even if the existence of the envisaged twin-track neural\nsystems could be established in the visual case, critics point out\nthat as things currently stand there is no reason for thinking Arstila\nis correct when he proposes that there are a range of different\nencapsulated systems, one for each of the other forms of temporal\nexperience. On the contrary: if, as has seemed plausible to many,\nall forms of consciousness possess a dynamic temporal\ncharacter then it is natural to conclude that temporality is closely\nconnected with the neural processes that are responsible for\nconsciousness itself:\n\n\nWhy adopt the encapsulated mechanism approach when it is simpler, more\nexplanatory, and truer to the phenomena to locate temporality as a\nfeature of a general mechanism responsible for consciousness, whatever\nthat may be? A feature of a general mechanism also has the benefit of\naccounting for why people never seem to go \u201ctimeless\u201d the\nway people go \u201cblind\u201d\u2014temporality is indispensable\nto consciousness because it is inextricably bound up with the\nprocesses responsible for it. (McKenna 2021: \u00a75)\n\n\nMcKenna suggests that the future-oriented predictive processing\nproposal from Hohwy, Paton, and Palmer (2015) fits the bill. An\nalternative general neuro-scientific mechanism is proposed by Piper\n(2019), who points to the merits of the re-entrant oscillatory\nmultiplexing (ROM) neurodynamical model. On the latter view the\ntemporal features of consciousness are the product of interlocking and\ninterdependent waves of neural activity that are extended through time\nin a manner that is difficult to reconcile with the cinematic view in\nany of its guises but eminently compatible with rival extensional\nmodels. Just as\n\n\nmusic is a product of various auditory resonances (in rhythm,\npitch and timbre, for example) amongst the parts of the active\norchestra. Analogously the ROM model formalizes the idea that coherent\nmental representations and experience is the product of various\nresonances (i.e. multiplexing) between the phases, frequencies and\namplitude parameters \u2026 of reciprocally connected\ninformation-processing (i.e. reentrant) brain circuits. (Piper 2019:\n9\u201310)\n\n\nIn a similar general vein Northoff (2016) and Northoff and Huang\n(2017) argue that the temporal features of consciousness are\ninextricably bound up with continuous neural oscillations that are\nextend through time in a continuous manner. These \u201cslow cortical\npulses\u201d are low frequency waves of neural activity that allow\nthe brain to unify stimuli that are temporally separated. This\nposition also runs counter to cinematic conceptions but gels neatly\nwith extensionalism.\n4. Retentional Approaches\n4.1 Motivations\n\nEndorsing the Augustinian doctrine that consciousness is confined to\nthe present point of time does not oblige one to reject the claim that\nchange and succession feature prominently in immediate experience.\nThese theses are quite compatible with one another provided the\nexperience of change occurs within the confines of the\nmomentary present. Indeed, in the eyes of some\u2014but not\nall\u2014this is a necessary precondition for contents to be\nexperienced together as parts of a unified whole. The obvious way of\ndeveloping an account along these lines is to hold that momentary\nepisodes of sensory consciousness are accompanied by a simultaneously\nexisting array of representations (or retentions) of\nimmediately preceding conscious states, and our awareness\u2014at a\nsingle moment of time\u2014of this combination of ingredients\nprovides us with what we take to be a direct awareness of change and\nsuccession. This \u201cretentional\u201d approach\u2014recalling\nthe terminology of\n \u00a71.1\u2014was\n comparatively commonplace by the end of the nineteenth century and\ncontinues to attract supporters.\n\nMany realists have no doubt found this approach appealing because it\noffers a simple and intuitively satisfying explanation of how an\nexperience of succession differs from a mere succession of\nexperiences: in the former case, the contents forming the succession\nare presented together, as an ensemble, to a single momentary\nawareness. Brentano and Husserl both subscribed to the Principle\nof Simultaneous Awareness (PSA) that we encountered in\n \u00a71.2:\n \u201cIf one is aware of a succession or duration, one is\nnecessarily aware of it at one moment\u201d. Indeed, it may well be\nthat some theorists, consciously or unconsciously, have found the\nretentional approach appealing because of the way it (in effect)\nreduces the problem of diachronic phenomenal unity to the\ncomparatively straightforward problem of synchronic unity.\n4.2 Brentano and Husserl\n\nBrentano recognized that reaching a clear understanding of how it is\npossible for us to directly experience succession and persistence is a\ncentral issue for phenomenology (or \u201cdescriptive\npsychology\u201d as he preferred to call it). He also recognized that\na mere succession of experiences does not, in and of itself, add up to\nan experience of succession. Brentano\u2019s solution: when listening\n(say) to an extended tone or melody, at each moment you are aware of a\nmomentary sound-phase, but you are also (and simultaneously) aware of\na series of representations (or retentions) of the immediately\npreceding phases. The latter Brentano referred to as\nproteraesthesis. Brentano\u2019s approach gives rise to\nseveral questions. How can contents which are simultaneous,\nobjectively speaking, seem to be successive? What is the precise\nnature of the representations occurring in proteraestheses?\nBrentano\u2019s views on these matters underwent several\nchanges\u2014see Chisholm (1981) and Kraus (1930 [1976]) for further\ndetails.\n\nThe early years of the twentieth century see Husserl developing an\naccount of time-consciousness along retentional lines. Husserl\nattended Brentano\u2019s lectures between 1884\u20136; inspired by\nthem, he decided to devote his energies to philosophy rather than\nmathematics. In elaborating his own position, in lectures in\n1904\u20136, Husserl begins with criticisms of what Brentano (and\nMeinong) had to say on the topic, but the position he ends up with is\nalong the same general lines. Husserl may not have adopted the term\n\u201cspecious present\u201d, but he did hold that we have a\nseemingly direct awareness of change and persistence amongst the\nobjects and processes we perceive over short intervals. He also held,\nplausibly, that as our streams of consciousness flow on, we have an\nawareness of their so doing. As for how this is possible, he thought\nit must involve past phases of consciousness somehow being\n\u201cretained in grasp\u201d in later moments of consciousness.\n\nAt the heart of Husserl\u2019s account is a dynamic tri-partite view\nof the composition of consciousness at any instant. The three\ncomponents are: primal impressions, retentions (or\n\u201cprimary memories\u201d) and protentions. Primal\nimpressions are the live, actual experiences that occupy the momentary\nnow. No sooner does a primal impression occur than it slips seamlessly\ninto the past. But it does not vanish from consciousness altogether:\nit survives in the form of a retention, which presents it as\npast. For Husserl, retentions are a quite distinctive form of\nconsciousness, and differ significantly from ordinary memories. As for\nprotentions, these are the future-oriented counterparts of retentions.\nIn some cases\u2014e.g., when we are perceiving or remembering a\nfamiliar sequence of events\u2014they can be quite detailed, but\noften they consist of nothing more than an openness to the\nfuture, an expectation that something will come.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1 Husserl\u2019s time diagram.\n[An\n extended description of Figure 4.1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThe basic mechanics of Husserl's theory are depicted in\n Figure 4.1,\n where the horizontal axis represents a continuous flow of primal\nimpressions, the vertical axes represent a selection of retentions\n(and in the case of F) protentions which accompany the primal\nimpressions D, E and F. (Only a \u201cselection\u201d because in\nreality, according to Husserl, a continuous stretch of consciousness\nconsists of a dense continuum of primal impressions, each of which is\naccompanied by its \u201ccomet\u2019s tail\u201d of retentions and\nprotentions.) As can be seen, individual primal impressions are\nretained in later specious presents\u2014increased\n\u201cpastness\u201d is indicated by a greater number of asterisks.\nWhat goes for momentary primal impressions also goes for intervals:\nD-E is retained at F in the form of the retentional continuum\nE*\u2013D**.\n\nThe broad outlines of Husserl\u2019s position may be clear enough,\nbut the details pose more of a challenge. Husserl wrote voluminously\non time-consciousness throughout his career but never found a position\nhe was happy with for long\u2014in his lectures from 1907\u201310 he\nfound fault with the position he elaborated in the 1904\u20136\nlectures\u2014and he never published a definitive statement of his\nposition. For useful introductions to Husserl\u2019s views see\nKortooms (2002) and Zahavi (2004, 2007, 2010).\n4.3 Temporal Illusions and Neuroscience\n\nIn a series of papers Rick Grush has developed a version of\nretentionalism in the form of the \u201ctrajectory estimation\nmodel\u201d (TEM) which draws on ideas and analyses from control\ntheory and signal processing\u2014for further details, see Grush\n(2005a, 2005b). So far as analogies with Husserl\u2019s doctrines are\nconcerned, a key point is that the internal models employed by these\nsystems are not confined to representing instantaneous states\nof the relevant domain. What is modelled, rather, is\nthe trajectory of the domain over a short interval of time,\ni.e., the entire succession of states that the system estimates that\ndomain is most likely to have been in during the relevant interval. It\nis this trajectory which Grush takes to be the information-processing\nanalogue of Husserl\u2019s tri-partite specious presents.\n\nGrush argues that the abilities of his systems to generate different\n(and incompatible) representations of what is being perceived at a\ngiven time is a positive boon, for it allows his theory to accommodate\na variety of temporal illusions. In so-called\n\u201cpost-dictive\u201d illusions what is experienced as seemingly\noccurring at a time t is influenced by stimuli arriving later\nthan t. One such illusion is the cutaneous rabbit\ndescribed by Geldard & Sherrick (1972). The experiment involved\ndevices capable of delivering controlled brief (2 msec) pulses to the\nskin being fitted along the arms of subjects. Surprisingly, when the\ndevices were clustered in just three tight configurations\u2014and\nthe wrist, the elbow and in-between\u2014and five pulses were\ndelivered to each location, rather than experiencing three tight\nclusters of pulses (one at the wrist, one at the elbow and one\nin-between) subjects report feeling a succession of evenly\nspaced pulses starting at the wrist and terminating a the elbow.\nThere are several questions that can be asked about this, but perhaps\nthe most puzzling is: what is happening at the time of the\nsecond pulse? How is the brain able to adopt the\n\u201cevenly spaced\u201d interpretation before the second\nflash even occurs?\n\nGrush\u2019s TEM has no difficulty explaining what is going on in\nsuch cases. In the case of the rabbit, the second pulse is initially\nexperienced as occurring at the wrist. But as the brain updates its\nmodels in the light of subsequent sensory information and its own\nexpectations as to the likely scenario confronting it, it alters its\nverdict and the second pulse is experienced as occurring further along\nthe arm, as part of an evenly spaced succession. When subjects are\nsubsequently queried as to what they experienced, it is the later\nexperiences which get reported\u2014the earlier ones are not\nremembered.\n\nProponents of competing approaches have defended different ways of\ninterpreting post-dictive illusions. Dainton (2008a: 381) argues that\ncases of this sort pose no problem for extensionalists:\n\n\nmight it not be that our visual systems take some time \u2026 before\nproducing experience in response to a given stimulus? And might they\nnot use this time to work out a single coherent\nversion of events before committing it to experience?\n\n\nEagleman and Sejnowski (2000) proposed a \u201cdelayed\nresponse\u201d construal of the flash-lag illusion along these lines.\nIn response Grush (2016: 5.1.1\n [Other Internet Resources])\n argues that since this additional delay will have to be incurred in\nall our perceptual systems all the time, positing it\nis by no means cost-free. Arstila (2016a) argues that Grush and\nDainton\u2019s explanations of post-dictive visual illusions are both\nproblematic, and proposes an\n alternative.[15]\n\nGeoff Lee (2014a, 2014b) defends what is arguably a retentional model\nof temporal experience, albeit one possessing some distinctive\nfeatures. Lee holds that specious presents are housed in experiential\nstates that have a very brief temporal extension\u2014Lee thinks\nthese states are identical with neural states and processes, and the\nlatter always have a non-zero temporal magnitude. Although these\nexperiences possess some temporal extension they do not have any\nexperiences as proper parts, and so Lee aptly calls them\n\u201catomic experiences\u201d. Extensionalists view specious\npresents as temporally extended experiences which do possess\nother experiences as proper parts, and for Lee this is the defining\nfeature of extensionalism. None of the seemingly-extended contents of\nLee\u2019s atomic experiences seem to be past- or\nmemory-like\u2014they are all fully perceptual in character\u2014and\nso different from Husserlian\n retentions.[16]\n\nOne of Lee\u2019s main arguments for preferring a version of the\nretentional (atomic) model is his \u201cTrace-Integration\nArgument\u201d, which has its roots in his preferred science-oriented\nmethodology. Lee points out a basic and widespread assumption in\nrecent cognitive psychology: information concerning what has been\nrecently perceived must be simultaneously present in subsequent\nrepresentations if it is to play any role in cognition (Lee 2014a:\n15). It does seem plausible to suppose that our brains engage in\ncoding of the sort Lee describes. What is more controversial is\nwhether this is the only kind of processing that our brains\nengage in when generating temporal experience. For a critical\nassessments of Lee\u2019s argument Viera (2019), and for very\ndifferent kind of neural models which rely on temporally extended\nneural processes see Northoff (2016), Northoff and Huang (2017), and\nPiper (2019).\n4.4 Retentions and Representationalism\n\nThe retentional model faces a number of challenges. For the doctrine\nto be plausible we must be able to make clear sense of the idea that\nexperienced duration can be contained in episodes of experiencing that\nare themselves without discernible duration, and retentionalists also\nneed to be able to provide a plausible account of how retentions can\ndo the job required of them. For a number of recent\ntheorists\u2014e.g., Grush, Kiverstein, Lee and Tye\u2014a currently\npopular theory of the nature of perceptual experience helps\nretentionalism solve these and other problems.\n\nIn the philosophy of perception representationalism (or\nintentionalism) is the doctrine that the phenomenal\nproperties we encounter in perception are determined by, or supervene\nupon, \u201crepresentational\u201d contents. Needless to say\nrepresentations come in very different forms, and the variety deployed\nby recent representationalists is of a distinctive kind. As Siegel\nusefully notes:\n\n\nwhen one speaks of the contents of a newspaper, one is talking about\nwhat information the newspaper stories convey. Many contemporary uses\nof \u201cthe contents of perception\u201d take such contents to be\nanalogous to the contents of a newspaper story. (2005 [2021:\n\u00a72])\n\n\nThe stories we encounter in newspapers often make claims about the\nworld, and can be assessed for their truth or accuracy, and one way of\nspecifying the content of a story is by specifying what would have to\nbe the case if the story is true. Representationalists maintain that\nthe contents carried by perceptual experiences are similar: we can\nspecify their content by specifying the conditions under which they\nare true (or reliable). Importantly, on this view perceptual\nexperiences can have representational contents even if the story they\nare telling is false: we do, after all, misperceive things from time\nto time\u2014a balloon which looks red might turn out to be\norange.\n\nRepresentationalists hold that, quite generally, the properties of a\nrepresentational vehicle (that which is doing the\nrepresenting) and the content of that representation (what is\nrepresented) need to be sharply distinguished. The word\n\u201cred\u201d can represent the colour red without itself\nbeing red. A copy of a newspaper is very different from the stories it\ntells. In the case of temporal experience anyone who finds this theory\nof perception appealing can adopt a quite straightforward position on\nthe nature of retentions: the latter provide us with a direct\nawareness of the recent past because they are perceptual experiences\npossessing meaningful contents that represent the recent past. The\nproblem of understanding how the experienced duration and succession\ncan exist in experiences that are durationless (or almost so) now has\na straightforward solution. As we have just seen, representational\nvehicles and their contents typically do have very different\nproperties, and this is a case in point. In the representationalist\nframework it would be a mistake to expect the temporal properties of\nan experience, a vehicle, to match those of its content.\n\nHoerl (2013a) argues that some of Husserl\u2019s otherwise puzzling\npronouncements become a good deal less puzzling if we suppose that he\nchanged his stance from something akin to a sense-datum theorist (in\nhis early days) to something akin to contemporary representationalism\n(in his later days). Husserl tells us that \u201cMemory\u2014and\nthis is equally true of retention\u2014is not image-consciousness, it\nis something totally different\u201d (Husserl TPZ [1991: 36]). He\nalso says that as a primal impression is transformed into a\nretention\n\n\nthere is a radical alteration, an alteration that can never be\ndescribed in the way in which we describe the changes in sensations\nthat lead again to sensations. (Husserl TPZ [1991: 336])\n\n\nWe can see how Husserl might have thought this true is he had (in\neffect) adopted\n representationalism.[17]\n\nThere is a further doctrine defended by many representationalists that\nis also relevant to our current concerns: an insistence on the\n\u201ctransparency\u201d of experience. By this they typically mean\n(in part at least) that in ordinary perceptual experience, we have no\nawareness whatsoever of our experiences themselves, we are simply\naware of the (worldly) objects and properties that are presented in or\nby our experiences. If our experiences are invisible, there is no need\nto introduce properties of experience\u2014phenomenal\nproperties, qualia, sense-data and such\u2014in order to explain the\ncontent and character of our ordinary perceptual consciousness.\nExtending this approach to the particular case of temporal\nconsciousness, Michael Tye argues as follows. First of all, if we\nassume the transparency thesis is true, the traditional assumption\nthat it is experiences that are related by succession or\nsimultaneity is misguided:\n\n\nConsider again the case in which I have an experience of a red flash\nfollowed by a green flash. Here I experience two colored\nflashes as occurring one after the other. I do not experience\nmy experience of a red flash as succeeding my\nexperience of a green one any more than I experience my\nexperience of a red flash as red. (2003: 96)\n\n\nAccordingly, Tye holds that anyone seeking to account for our ability\nto directly apprehend change by appealing to a unifying relationship\nbetween experiences is also misguided: there simply aren\u2019t the\ntoken experiences there to beunified; a given period or\nstretch of consciousness is not composed of successive perceptions or\nexperiences (2003: 102). By way of an alternative he offers a one\nexperience view of streams of consciousness:\n\n\nThe simplest hypothesis compatible with what is revealed by\nintrospection is that, for each period of consciousness, there is only\na single experience\u2014an experience that represents everything\nexperienced within the period of consciousness as a whole. (2003:\n97)\n\n\nFor a recent defence of Tye\u2019s general approach to transparency\nin the case of temporal experience see Heeney (2021). As Bayne notes,\nTye\u2019s one experience proposal does not sit easily with some of\nhis other views. Tye holds that experiences are representational\nstates that have the ability to directly feed into our cognitive\nsystems. Bayne asks:\n\n\nIs it really plausible to suppose that the contents of an entire\nstream of consciousness\u2014that is, the period of consciousness\nbetween one state of unconsciousness and the next\u2014are poised for\ndirect input in to the reasoning system? \u2026 That seems\nextremely unlikely. (Bayne 2005: 498)\n\n\nSoteriou (2010: 230) is also puzzled by this aspect of Tye\u2019s\nposition.\n\nFor discussion of some further issues relating to retentional specious\npresents see the supplementary document\n The Specious Present: Further Issues.\n5. Extensional Approaches\n5.1 Origins: A Dogma Rejected\n\nStern observes at the start of his \u201cMental Presence-Time\u201d\n(1897 [2005]) that much recent work in psychology makes an assumption\nabout the kind of unities that can exist within experience: only\ncontents that are instantaneous and simultaneous can\nbe apprehended together. Needless to say, this assumption amounts to a\ncommitment to PSA\u2014see\n \u00a71.2.\n Stern proposes that we reject this constraint:\n\n\nThat only those contents can belong to a whole of consciousness that\nexist together and are simultaneously present at any given time\n\u2026 is a dogma, which, in a more or less veiled form, determines\nnumerous psychological reflections. I consider this dogma, at least in\nthis generalized form, to be false. I believe that there are instances\nwhen an apprehension first comes into being on the basis of temporally\nextended content of consciousness, in such a manner that every part of\nthis content exists in an insoluble connection with every other part.\n(Stern, 1897 [2005: 313])\n\n\nRejecting PSA brings a number of advantages. Experienced contents\nwhich appear to be successive can really be successive, rather than\nexisting simultaneously (as with retentional models), similarly\nepisodes of consciousness which seem to persist through intervals of\nordinary objective time can really do so. Abandoning the dogma means\nthat temporal consciousness need no longer be systematically\nmisleading as to its own nature. Stern was well aware why his\ncontemporaries maintained that it was necessary to distinguish a\nsuccession of experiences from an experience of succession. A sequence\nof musical notes will only be experienced as a succession if they are\nexperienced together, with each being experienced as following on from\nits predecessor. Stern was simply suggesting that these unified\nexperiential episodes are themselves extended over temporal intervals\nrather than momentary.\n\n\nI therefore put forth the following principle: mental events that play\nthemselves out within a stretch of time can under circumstances form a\nunified and complex act of consciousness regardless of the\nnon-simultaneity of individual parts. That stretch of time over which\na mental act can be extended I call its presence-time. (Stern 1897\n[2005: 315])\n\n\nWundt held that complexes of sensory contents could only be\napprehended directly if they exist in a conscious whole\nsimultaneously. Stern rejects this: \u201cAs a whole, yes; as\nsimultaneous, no\u201d (1897 [2005: 319]). What of the notion\n\u201cthe present\u201d if we follow Stern and embrace an\nextensional model of temporal experience? Stern suggests we\nneedn\u2019t reject the idea that experiences can be present. All we\nneed do is define the present \u201cas the totality of temporal and\nspatial relations that can become the object of a direct\nperception\u201d (1897 [2005: 325]). Since we directly perceive\nevents spanning brief intervals, the present thus construed is a\npositive and finite stretch of time.\n\nHow do individual presence-times combine to form streams of\nconsciousness? In ordinary life we are, after all, continually\nconscious for hours at a stretch, whereas individual presence-times\nare very short. Stern does not address this question in his article so\nhe can offer little assistance\u2014see Dainton (2017b) for a fuller\naccount of Stern's views \u2014however it was not long before a\npromising proposal emerged. In 1915 Bertrand Russell published his\n\u201cOn the Experience of Time\u201d in The Monist, where\nthe stream-composition question is addressed. Russell begins by\nintroducing some key terms and theses. A sensation involves a\nsubject standing in the acquaintance relation with an object or\nsense-datum. Russell makes it clear that he believes change can be\ndirectly experienced, telling us:\n\n\nSuccession is a relation which may hold between two parts of\none sensation, for instance between two parts of a swift movement\nwhich is the object of one sensation; it may then, and perhaps also\nwhen one or both objects are objects of immediate memory, be\nimmediately experienced, and extended by inference to cases where one\nor both of the terms are not present. (1915: 213)\n\n\nHow do specious presents combine to form entire streams of\nconsciousness? Here Russell usefully goes beyond Stern and proposes\nthat neighbouring specious presents in the same stream of\nconsciousness are related by overlap or part-sharing. Let\u2019s\nsuppose A, B, C are brief sounds of the same duration that are\nexperienced as a succession in the same continuous stream of\nconsciousness; let\u2019s also suppose that the lengths of these\nsounds are such that only two of them can be experienced together.\nRussell suggests that the resulting temporally extended experience\nwill include two specious presents [A-followed-by-B] and\n[B-followed-by-C], and since the experiencing of the B-sound is\nnumerically identical with the experiencing of the B-sound in the\nlater specious present the B is heard just once, not twice. The\nresulting stream of auditory consciousness consists of a continuous\nsuccession of sounds, each heard as following on from its predecessor,\nwhere only two sounds are experienced together as directly\nsuccessive.\n\nRussell goes on to offer a further important observation:\n\n\nIf A, B and C succeed each other rapidly, A and B may be parts of one\nsensation, and likewise B and C, while A and C are not parts of one\nsensation. But A is remembered when C is present in sensation. In such\na case, A and B belong to the same present, and likewise B and C, but\nnot A and C; thus the relation \u201cbelong to the same\npresent\u201d is not transitive. (Russell 1915: 233)\n\n\nAs Russell clearly appreciates, if the relation of \u201cbelonging to\nthe same present\u201d were transitive, then A would\nnecessarily belong to the same (specious) present as C, and more\ngenerally, all the partially overlapping phases of a stream of\nconsciousness would have the character of a single unified specious\npresent\u2014and so you would now be directly experiencing what you\nsaw and heard when you first awoke this morning. Since this is\nmanifestly not the case, the \u201cbelonging to the same\npresent\u201d relation is clearly not transitive.\n5.2 More Recent Defences and Discussions\n5.2.1 Awareness, Simplicity and Overlap\n\nJohn Foster has defended an overlap-version of the extensional view on\na number of occasions. Foster has no doubt that temporally extended\nphenomena are an important feature of our ordinary experience,\nobserving that\n\n\nduration and change through time seem to be presented to us with the\nsame phenomenal immediacy as homogeneity and variation of colour\nthrough space. (Foster 1982: 255)\n\n\nFoster begins his discussion by assuming an awareness-content model of\nconsciousness. Let\u2019s suppose a musical scale is being sung, and\nthe duration of the notes is such that a listening subject is aware of\nthree notes in succession. As the scale unfolds the subject will have\na succession of auditory experiences\n\nE1 = [do-re-mi],\nE2 = [re-mi-so],\nE3 = [mi-so-fa]\n\n\nand so on. This sequence of experiences has a puzzling feature: it\nlooks as though the notes are being experienced more than once, with\nre featuring in E1and E2, mi in E1, E2 and E3, and\nso in E2 and E3. Experiences like this are not logically\nimpossible, Foster suggests, but our ordinary experience of listening\nto a series of notes obviously doesn\u2019t include repetitions of\nthis sort.\n\nFoster proposes a solution:\n\n\na presentation of a temporal pattern is itself temporally extended,\nand it overlaps its predecessor and successor in, so to speak,\npresentational substance to the extent that its pattern overlaps\ntheirs in phenomenal content. It is this double overlap which provides\nthe key to the sensible continuity of sense experience and unifies\npresentations into a stream of awareness. (Foster 1979: 176)\n\n\nEach of the two horizontal brackets in\n Figure 5.1\n represents an act of awareness that is temporally extended and\nunified; each of these extended acts produces a specious present, the\nfirst consisting of the experiencing of do-re and the second\nre-mi. Unrealistic repetitions are avoided by virtue of the\nfact that the extended acts overlap by sharing a common part.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1 Foster\u2019s double overlap\ntheory featuring temporally extended awareness and contents. [An\n extended description of Figure 5.1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nIn his Stream of Consciousness (2000, second edition 2006)\nBarry Dainton sets himself the goal of providing a phenomenological\naccount of the sort of unity and continuity we find in our ordinary\nstreams of consciousness. Dainton does not take any stand on the\nrelationship between the experiential and the physical, other than to\nassume that consciousness is \u201can irreducible ingredient of\nreality in its own right\u201d (2000 [2006: xiv]). He also adopts an\nindirect realist or \u201cprojectivist\u201d view of perceptual\nexperience.\n\nDainton\u2019s initial focus is on the synchronic (at-a-time) unity\nof consciousness. He argues that the togetherness of the\ndiverse experiences we are having at any one time is itself a feature\nour experience, and after considering attempts to explain\nco-consciousness in other terms Dainton concludes that it should be\nregarded as a primitive relationship. Among the rejected accounts of\nphenomenal unity is the thesis that experiential objects and contents\nare unified by virtue of falling under a single act of awareness. The\nidea that consciousness has an awareness-content structure\u2014as\nassumed by Foster\u2014is an appealing one in several respects, but\non closer examination all forms of this \u201cA-thesis\u201d turn\nout to be seriously flawed, or so Dainton argues. By way of an\nalternative Dainton adopts a one-level view of the structure of\nconsciousness he calls the \u201csimple conception\u201d:\n\n\nThe A-theorist tried to keep awareness distinct from content, but\nsince this turned out to be a mistake we must accept that awareness\nand content are not distinct ingredients within experience. It follows\nthat consciousness is inseparable from phenomenal contents: when a\ngiven phenomenal item comes into being it comes into being as a\nconscious experience \u2026 contents are themselves intrinsically\nconscious, and hence\u2014in a manner of speaking\u2014they are\nself-revealing or self-intimating. (Dainton 2000: 57)\n\n\nIn the chapters of Stream of Consciousness devoted to\ntemporal experience Dainton argues that a number of existing\napproaches face serious problems. These include memory theories in\nvarious guises, pulse-theories, Broad\u2019s extended content model\nand Husserl\u2019s version of retentionalism. Dainton concludes that\nthe \u201coverlap\u201d form of the extensional theory defended by\nRussell and Foster has significant advantages over the alternatives,\nand is worthy of further development. Amongst its other virtues it\noffers a plausible explanation of the way consciousness can be\nexperienced as deeply continuous for hours at a stretch, something\nrival approaches fail to provide.\n\nFor Dainton the earlier and later contents of an individual specious\npresent form a single unified experience by virtue of being\nexperienced together. Dainton argues experiences can be unified over\ntime in the same primitive way as experiences at a time, and so the\nearlier and later contents within a single specious present can be\nco-conscious, but diachronically rather than synchronically. There are\nhowever, differences between the synchronic and diachronic forms of\nco-consciousness. It is natural to think that synchronic phenomenal\nunity is transitive, but as Russell and Foster noted, in the\ndiachronic case failures of transitivity are ubiquitous, and can occur\nwhenever two specious presents partially overlap. Dainton (2000 [2006:\nchapters 8 and 9]) argues that co-consciousness in its synchronic and\ndiachronic forms connects experiences so profoundly that a form of\nholism ensues, and since specious presents consist of experiential\nparts connected by co-consciousness this form of holism extends to\nthem.\n\nDainton\u2019s account of individual specious presents has one\nfurther ingredient. Dainton takes consciousness to be dynamic in a\nstrong way: he holds that our experiences typically exhibit a\n\u201cdiscernible phenomenal flow \u2026 a sense that the\nsame kind of phenomenal quality is being continuously renewed\u201d\n(2004a: 15). It is difficult to see how this feature of our experience\ncould be explained by the co-consciousness relationship alone, since\nthe latter is a symmetrical relationship: if do is\nco-conscious with re then re will be co-conscious\nwith do. Given this symmetry, how is it that we\ndo-flowing-into-re? It is at this point that Dainton\nintroduces an additional ingredient: phenomenal contents\n\n\nwhich are symmetrically joined by co-consciousness themselves possess\nan inherent directional dynamism. The C-tone is not a static auditory\nquality, but a flowing quality, likewise for D and E. This\nimmanent flow is an essential ingredient of any auditory\ncontent, just as essential as timbre, pitch or volume. (2004a: 23)\n\n\nIn\n Figure 5.2\n this dynamic flow is represented by horizontal arrows, and the upper\nand lower brackets represent the span of diachronic\nco-consciousness.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2 Dainton's Simple Overlap\nModel. [An\n extended description of Figure 5.1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nIn \u201cSensing Change\u201d (2008a) Dainton introduces the\n\u201cextensional model\u201d as the doctrine that individual\nspecious presents consist of \u201ctemporally extended episodes of\nexperience that are apprehended as wholes\u201d. Dainton also\nresponds to Grush\u2019s claim that the extensional model is\nincapable of accommodating temporal illusions such as the\nphi-phenomenon in a plausible manner: one way of making sense of the\nillusions is to suppose that our brains take some time before deciding\non an interpretation of incoming stimuli. In response Grush (2017)\noffers several criticisms of this \u201cdelayed\nextensionalism\u201d, and argues that the envisaged processing delay\nwould be more problematic than Dainton realizes. Arstila (2016a)\nargues that the approaches defended by Grush and Dainton are both\nproblematic, and offers his own alternative account of apparent\nmotion.\n\nOn a different theme, Dainton (2014) focuses on various issues related\nto the temporal structure of consciousness on the smallest of scales,\nand he defends the view that our streams of consciousness are\n\u201cessentially extended continua\u201d whose smallest parts have\nsome finite temporal extension. By virtue of not being composed of\nstrictly momentary parts a challenge to extensionalism by Pelczar\n(2010a, 2010b) can be met, or so Dainton proposes.\n\nSome of Dainton\u2019s criticisms of alternative approaches have\nthemselves come under critical fire. Gallagher (2003) argues that many\nof Dainton\u2019s criticisms of Husserl are ineffective if Husserl is\nconstrued in the right sort of way\u2014Dainton (2003) responds. Dan\nZahavi finds that Dainton\u2019s analysis of the structure of streams\nof consciousness has many virtues (2007: 470) but is also problematic\nin several respects. Zahavi is also inclined to view experiences as\nintrinsically conscious, but argues that Dainton\u2019s simple\nconception of consciousness goes too far and in the end is too\nsimplistic. He is unimpressed by Dainton\u2019s claim that Husserl\nsimply stipulates that retentions have the mysterious features they\nneed in order to make his theory work, pointing out that Dainton\nhimself takes co-consciousness to be a primitive feature, one that\ncannot be analysed or reduced to anything else \u201cand if he can\nemploy that kind of argument, I fail to see why Husserl can\u2019t as\nwell\u201d (Zahavi 2007: 468).\n\nProsser finds the notion of co-consciousness that Dainton takes to be\nprimitive phenomenological feature \u201cquite mysterious\u201d\n(2016: 147) and so unhelpful:\n\n\nI can only say that in my own case I am not at all certain what it\nshould be like for two of my experiences to be co-conscious and yet\nnot occur at the same time without this simply being a case of the\nearlier experience being retained in a short-term memory. (2016:\n147)\n\n\nComing from a similar direction Chuard (2017: 127\u20138) suggests\nthat since snapshot theorists can accommodate the seemingly flow-like\ncharacter of experience there is no need for the theoretical apparatus\nDainton\u2019s approach requires.\n\nRashbrook (2013c) finds Dainton\u2019s claim that synchronic and\ndiachronic co-consciousness are different forms of the same kind of\nbasic relation problematic for a different reason. If Dainton is right\nin claiming that co-consciousness is primitive then \u201cthe only\nfeatures of the relation that we can describe are its logical\nproperties\u201d (2013c: 479), and these differ. Doesn\u2019t the\nfact that synchronic co-consciousness is transitive and diachronic\nco-consciousness non-transitive mean we are dealing with two relations\nhere, rather than one? There is a tension in Dainton\u2019s\nposition\u2014as Bayne (2001: 85) also notes\u2014but the situation\nmay not be as clear-cut as Rashbrook suggests. Co-consciousness may be\na basic relation but this does not mean that our knowledge of its\nnature is confined to its logical properties. We are also\u2014or so\nDainton claims\u2014acquainted with its phenomenological character:\nco-consciousness is simply a label for experienced togetherness, a\nmode of unity which can be found binding simultaneous and also\nsuccessive contents in our streams of\n consciousness.[18]\n5.2.2 Temporal Structures and Transparency\n\nIn a number of provocative contributions Ian Phillips has argued that\nmuch of the temporal experience debate has rested on confusions and\nerroneous assumptions, which leads Phillips to call for a fresh start.\nThe main target of Phillips (2010) is the Principle of Simultaneous\nAwareness (PSA), the doctrine that \u201cif one experiences\nsuccession or temporal structure at all, then one experiences it at a\nmoment\u201d (2010: 177). Phillips suggests that this doctrine\nunderlies both the various memory theories found in the literature,\nand specious present theories along the lines of Broad\u2019s (see\n \u00a76.1\n below). Phillips argues that PSA is false. If it were true then it\nwould be possible for the structure of our experience and the temporal\nstructure of the objects and events presented to us in our experience\nto differ. But Phillips argues that this is in fact impossible.\n\nPhillips\u2019 argument for this controversial claim rests on two key\nclaims. One is \u201cSeems implies Is\u201d, experience cannot be\nsystematically misleading as to its own nature, and hence\n\n\nwe cannot make sense of the idea that experience seems to one\u2019s\nrational introspective reflection to possess a certain temporal\nordering, when it is not in fact so ordered. (2010: 183)\n\n\nThe other key claim is that the temporal aspects of our experience are\n\u201ctransparent\u201d in a distinctive way:\n\n\none\u2019s only way of making rational judgments about the temporal\nstructure of experience itself, at least through reflection on\none\u2019s experience alone, is by taking the temporal structure of\nthe experience to map the temporal structure of the world as it is\nexperienced as being. (2010: 184)\n\n\nIf experience is transparent in this manner then we will judge that an\nexperience of a succession of notes will itself unfold over time in\njust the way the notes seem to. If the \u201cSeems implies Is\u201d\nprinciple is also correct then it is impossible for the temporal\nproperties of experience and its objects to systematically diverge in\nthe way PSA predicts.\n\nIn \u201cThe Temporal Structure of Experience\u201d (2014c) Phillips\nsets out to defend what he calls the \u201cna\u00efve view\u201d of\nthe manner in which the temporal structure of experience and the\ntemporal structure of the objects of experience are related.\n\n\n\u2026 when all goes well, your stream of consciousness inherits the\ntemporal structure of the events that are its contents. You\n\u201ctake in\u201d the temporal structure of the events you witness\nin witnessing them. As a result, the temporal structure of experience\nmatches the temporal structure of its objects. In cases of illusion,\nit is as if this is so. Thus, in every case, the temporal structure of\nexperience matches the apparent temporal structure of the objects of\nexperience. (Phillips 2014c: \u00a77.1)\n\n\nPhillips suggests na\u00efvet\u00e9 applies for temporal properties\nsuch as simultaneity, successiveness, relative duration and temporal\norder. Phillips goes on to address an objection. The claim that\nexperience is transparent is also commonly made by proponents of the\nrepresentationalist view of perception. Representationalists such as\nMichael Tye maintain that perceptual experience is entirely\ndiaphanous, and hence that we have no introspective access to it, only\nto the objects in the world that it reveals. If this conception of\ntransparency is correct, Phillips\u2019 claim that we have\nintrospective access to the temporal properties of our experience must\nbe wrong. In response Phillips points out when it comes to experience,\ntime is special. It may well be correct to reject the idea that an\nexperience of redness or squareness is itself red or square. But\n\n\nour experiential encounter with time is quite unlike color or shape,\nsince our experience is not just of time, but also manifestly in time.\n(2014c: 144)\n\n\nFor critical assessments of these views see Lee (2014a), Frischhut\n(2015) and Viera (2019).\n\nPhillips also makes a claim about what the extensional theory of\ntemporal experience really amounts to. Following Soteriou\u2019s lead\nhere, for Phillips the key and defining feature of extensionalism is\nnot simply a claim that an experience of change or succession\ntakes place over an extended period. It is that when it comes to\nexperience \u201cit is significant stretches, not instants, that are\nexplanatorily and metaphysically fundamental\u201d (2014c:149).\n\nA number of theorists have argued that Phillips\u2019 inheritance\nthesis\u2014that for any temporal property apparently presented in\nexperience our experience itself possesses that temporal\nproperty\u2014is undermined by one or other temporal illusions.\nPhillips disagrees, and in a series of papers devoted to different\nillusions he finds ways of reconciling his na\u00efvet\u00e9 with\nthe allegedly problematic experimental findings. Several of the latter\ncentre on postdiction, the well-established phenomenon when what we\nexperience as occurring at a time t is influenced by sensory\nstimuli occurring later than t. Phillips argues (2014c:\n\u00a77.7\u20137.8) that provided we recognize that episodes of\nexperience extending over several hundred milliseconds are\nmetaphysically basic postdiction ceases to be deeply puzzling, for\nthere is no reason to assume happenings later than t are\nirrelevant to what we experience at t. In Phillips (2014a)\nthe focus is on whether the so-called \u201cmotion-silencing\u201d\nillusion poses a threat to na\u00efvet\u00e9, as some have argued\n(for example, Suchow & Alvarez 2011; Watzl 2013). The illusion\nfeatures a ring of coloured dots which are seen to cease to changing\ncolour when they start rotating. Phillips argues that rather it is\nbest construed as a instance of change-blindness, rather than as a\nfailure of inheritance. In \u201cPerceiving and the Passage of\nTime\u201d (2013) Phillips deals with the challenges posed by the\npassage of time apparently speeding up reported by the survivors of\nlife-threatening dangers, along with other duration distortions\nincluding the \u201codd-ball effect\u201d. Phillips (2014b) provides\na useful overview of his own work on temporal illusions.\n\nMatthew Soteriou\u2019s stance on a number of issues runs parallel to\nPhillips\u2019. Soteriou also thinks that our perceptual experiences\nare in certain important respects transparent. In ordinary perceiving\nwe seem to be directly aware not only of external worldly objects but\nalso of events which are extended through time, and we do not seem to\nbe aware of mental items such as sense-data. But he also thinks that\nin ordinary perception we have an awareness of temporal aspects of our\nexperiences.\n\n\nIntrospectively, it doesn\u2019t seem to one as though one can mark\nout the temporal location of one\u2019s perceptual experience as\ndistinct from the temporal location of whatever it is that one seems\nto be perceptually aware of. Furthermore, it seems to one as though\nthe temporal location of one\u2019s experience depends on, and is\ndetermined by, the temporal location of whatever it is that\none\u2019s experience is an experience of. (Soteriou 2013: 89f.)\n\n\nIf Soteriou is right, introspection can reveal the temporal properties\nof not only the events we perceive, but also of the perceptual\nexperiences that are revealing these events, and the events and\nexperiences seem to have the same duration. Introspection can thus\nprovide evidence that our temporal experiences are themselves\ntemporally extended, given that we directly experience change and\nsuccession\u2014in line with extensionalism. See Hoerl (2018) for\nsome further discussion.\n\nAmong writers on temporal experience Soteriou is distinctive in the\nemphasis he places on ontological issues, with different\ntypes of mental states\u2014when their nature is properly\nunderstood\u2014having quite different relationships with time. As\nSoteriou makes clear, his own thinking on these questions has been\nstrongly influenced by Brian O\u2019Shaughnessy. The latter\nintroduces his own position in Consciousness and the World\nthus:\n\n\nYet even when experience is not changing in type or content, it still\nchanges in another respect: it is constantly renewed, a new\nsector of itself is there and then taking place. \u2026 In\nshort, the domain of experience is essentially a domain of\noccurrences, or processes and events. (O\u2019Shaughnessy 2000:\n42\u201343)\n\n\nIn developing his own position Soteriou draws a distinction between\nmental states and occurrent mental processes, with a distinguishing\nfeature of the latter being the way they unfold over time\nwhereas states don\u2019t. For Soteriou (2007: 551\u201355) the\nbasic units of temporal experience are temporally extended rather than\nmomentary:\n\n\nThe answer we give to the question of what state a subject is in at a\ntime is determined by the answer we give to the question of what state\nthe subject is in during an interval of time that includes that\ninstant\u2026. (2007: 554)\n\n\nSoteriou defends a version of direct realism (or relationalism) in\nwhich perceptual states are occurrent processes which are accompanied\nby representational states which exist in virtue of perceptual\nprocesses, and which wouldn\u2019t otherwise exist. Soteriou\nargues\u2014here following in Geach\u2019s footsteps\u2014that\nthought-like mental representations do not unfold over time in the way\nperceptual forms of consciousness do, a fact which seriously\nundermines the representationalist theories of perception in several\nof its guises. For more on these themes see Soteriou (2007, 2010,\n2013, 2018).\n\nOliver Rashbrook has put Soteriou\u2019s process-state distinction to\nuseful work, showing that it can help dispel confusions surrounding\nthe idea that consciousness is continuous (Rashbrook 2013b) and also\nhelp meet Pelczar\u2019s challenge to extensional approaches\n(Rashbrook 2013a). In a more critical vein see Rodr\u00edguez (2016)\nand Steward (2018).\n5.2.3 Tense, Perception and Unity\n\nIn his \u201cTime and Tense in Perceptual Experience\u201d (2009)\nChristof Hoerl also defends a form of extensionalism, albeit under the\nguise of \u201cmolecularism\u201d. For Hoerl this approach can only\nhope to be viable if it is formulated in tenseless rather than tensed\nterms. Although specious present theorists have often assumed that\ntemporal experience is best characterized in tensed terms such as\n\u201cpast\u201d, \u201cpresent\u201d and \u201cfuture\u201d,\nHoerl argues that in the extensionalist framework it is tenseless\nnotions such as \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d that are\nrequired. When hearing an auditory succession consisting of a\nwhizz-bang we don\u2019t first experience the whizz as present and\nthen (shortly after) as past-seeming:\n\n\nmy experience is rather as of each sound occurring in turn, and my\nexperience\u2019s taking this course is what constitutes my being\naware of the whizz being followed by the bang. (Hoerl 2009: 8)\n\n\nIn a later article Hoerl (2013b) suggests here that currently the two\nmost promising approaches to temporal experience are extensionalism on\nthe one hand, and representationalist variants of retentionalism. He\nalso suggests\u2014also see Hoerl (2017)\u2014that the\nextensionalist view of temporal experience and the direct realist (or\n\u201crelationalist\u201d) account of perception are natural\npartners. The representationalist stance on perceptual experience can\nassist the retentionalist in a number of ways, as we saw in\n \u00a74.4.\n Hoerl is also right that anyone who adopts a realist stance with\nrespect to temporal experience and who also inclines to direct realism\nwill find the extensional view a natural and appealing one. If I see a\ntraffic light change colour then for a direct realist an object\nundergoing change over an interval of time is being directly presented\nto me, and the resulting perceptual experience will itself extend\nthrough time, just as extensionalists claim. However, on the face of\nit the extensional approach seems compatible with other views\nconcerning the nature of perceptual experience, such as the indirect\nrealism Dainton prefers one, or adverbialism to mention but\ntwo\u2014see Crane and French (2015 [2021]) for an overview of the\ncompeting theories.\n\nThe form of extensionalism defended by Hoerl is distinctive in a\nfurther way. As Hoerl notes (2013b: \u00a76), to account for the\ndifference between a succession of experiences and an experience of\nsuccession it is commonly argued that the latter possess a distinctive\nkind of unity that is absent from the former. Dainton, for\nexample, holds that contents occurring at different times are only\nexperienced as successive if they are bound together by his diachronic\nco-consciousness relationship. Hoerl argues that this assumption is in\nfact misguided, and that if we embrace extensionalism there is no need\nto appeal to this or any other unifying relation. In explaining how an\nexperience of succession differs from a succession of experiences the\nonly factor extensionalist needs to appeal to is the limited temporal\nspan of our temporal awareness. Hoerl suggests that Dainton\u2019s\nappeal to the non-transitivity of co-consciousness amounts to nothing\nmore than\n\n\nanother way of stating the intuition behind the individuation argument\nthat the maximum duration that individual temporal experiences can\nspan is limited. (Hoerl 2013b: 406)\n\n\nIt is not obvious that extensionalists can dispense with the services\nof a diachronic unity relationship. Let\u2019s consider things from\nthe vantage point of Hoerl\u2019s favoured combination of\nextensionalism and direct realism. Direct realists hold that\n(veridical) perception involves two elements: an external\nmind-independent object and an act or episode of perceptual\nawareness\u2014a perceptual experience occurs when our awareness\nacquaints us with an outer object. In the synchronic case: it is\nwidely (if not universally) agreed that phenomenal unity is a real and\nimportant phenomenon. My current visual and auditory experiences are\nunified in a distinctive way, whereas my current visual experiences\nand your current auditory experiences are not.\n\nSynchronic phenomenal unity can be accounted for in different\nways\u2014see Brook and Raymont (2017 [2021]) for further details.\nOne option is to hold that there is a unity relation which joins\nexperiences together. A second option is to say that experiences are\nunified by virtue of being subsumed in a more encompassing experience.\nA further option is to hold that experiential contents are unified\nwhen they fall under a single act of awareness. The latter option will\nbe a natural one for direct realists, given their view of the role\nawareness plays in ordinary perception. Direct realists who take this\nstance on synchronic unity are, in effect, getting an account of\nsynchronic unity for free\u2014it follows from a prior theoretical\ncommitment to a certain view of perception. But it remains the case\nthat the contents at any given time in a typical stream of\nconsciousness are unified in a distinctive way.\n\nThe same applies in the diachronic case. Anyone who combines the\nextensional view with direct realism will presumably hold that our\ntemporal experience relies on acts of awareness which are themselves\ntemporally extended. But as in the synchronic case, the contents that\nfall under these acts of awareness will be unified in a distinctive\nway: their successive parts are experienced together rather\nthan separately. When Hoerl talks of \u201cindividual\nexperiences\u201d it is presumably unified ensembles of this kind to\nwhich he is referring. Phenomenal unity has not departed from the\nscene, it is merely being explicated in a different way.\n\nMoreover, phenomenal unity is not confined to the contents of\nexperience, it will also exist at the level of acts of awareness. In\nthe synchronic case, if consciousness has an awareness-content\nstructure all contents have to do in order to be phenomenally unified\nis to fall under a single awareness at a give time. In the diachronic\ncase the situation is not so straightforward. An act of awareness\nwhich extends across an interval of time will be composed of different\nphases, and unless the successive phases of the extended acts of\nawareness are themselves experienced together\u2014in the manner\ndepicted in\n Figure 5.1\n above\u2014we won\u2019t have experiences of succession.\n\nTo make matters more concrete let us focus on a temporally extended\nepisode of awareness A, which has sufficient temporal\nextension to encompass a traffic light\u2019s changing from red to\ngreen, but which does not stretch any further into the past or future.\nWe can represent this state of affairs schematically thus:\nA[red, green]. Let\u2019s now narrow our focus and\nconsider two briefer sub-phases of this experience:\nA[red] and A[green] corresponding to\nthe earlier and later phases of the experience we are considering.\nUnless the earlier and later phases of A are\nphenomenally unified our subject\u2019s stream of consciousness\nconsists of two entirely discrete experiences: A[red]\nand A[green] experienced in succession but not\nas a succession. In order for our subject to have a single\nexperience\u2014an experience of succession rather than a\nsuccession of experiences\u2014it has to be the case that the red and\ngreen lights are experienced together rather than separately. Adopting\na direct realist conception of perception doesn\u2019t eliminate the\nneed for a mental unity relation, it merely gets re-located or\nre-described. Or so a critic might object.\n\nFor discussion of some further issues relating to extensional specious\npresents see the supplementary document\n The Specious Present: Further Issues.\n6. Hybrid Approaches\n6.1 Extended Contents and Momentary Acts\n\nGiven that the retentional and extensional approaches continue to have\ntheir defenders a not unreasonable conclusion to draw is that both may\ncontain an element of the truth so far as the nature and structure of\ntemporal consciousness is concerned. Given this it is not surprising\nto find a number of writers proposing hybrid models\nwhich\u2014in differing ways\u2014contain elements of both.\n\nIn his Scientific Thought (1923) C.D. Broad writes:\n\n\nThere is no doubt that sensible motion and rest are genuine\nunanalysable properties of visual sensa. I am aware of them as\ndirectly as I am aware of the redness of a red patch (1923: 287)\n\n\na clear commitment to realism. Later in the same work, in a much-cited\npassage he elaborates thus:\n\n\n\u2026 it is a notorious fact that we do not merely notice that\nsomething has moved or otherwise changed; we also often see\nsomething moving or changing. This happens if we\nlook at the second-hand of a watch or look at a flickering flame.\nThese are experiences of a quite unique kind; we could no more\ndescribe what we sense in them to a man who had never had such\nexperiences than we could describe a red colour to a man born blind.\n(1923: 351)\n\n\nThe account of the structure of temporal consciousness Broad went on\nto develop in Scientific Thought is of a distinctive kind. It\nis built on acts of awareness that are themselves momentary but which\napprehend contents distributed over a short interval of time. For\nBroad a stream of consciousness consists of dense sequences of\nmomentary acts and extended contents, with the consequence that the\ncontents apprehended by neighbouring acts largely overlap. For anyone\nwho holds that consciousness has an awareness-content structure\nBroad\u2019s basic approach may well look quite promising\u2014and\nmany direct realists as well as sense-datum theorists fall into this\ncategory. The sort of overlap Broad envisages is shown in\n Figure 6.1,\n where three momentary acts A1, A2, and A3 apprehend a succession of\nauditory tones C-D-E-F, with each act able to apprehend two adjoining\ntones.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1 C.D. Broad's Theory. [An\n extended description of Figure 6.1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nBroad\u2019s theory has its merits, but it also gives rise to some\nproblems and puzzles. Let\u2019s suppose that during the experiencing\nof the D-tone a brief flash of light is also experienced\u2014in\n Figure 6.2\n below the flash is represented by the asterisk shape. This flash\nfalls under A1, and so is experienced by that awareness; it also falls\nunder A2, and so is experienced by that awareness. Hence the problem:\nit looks as though the flash is experienced twice, when in reality it\nwould be experienced only once. In fact the situation is far worse,\nbecause in Broad\u2019s model there are many additional momentary\napprehensions occurring between A1 and A2, each creating a different\nexperience. As Mabbott puts it:\n\n\nNothing in my direct experience confirms this repetition. If it\noccurred it would obviously make listening to music or to continuous\nsentences a matter of the greatest complexity and difficulty. (Mabbott\n1951: 161)\n\n\nDainton (2000 [2006: 141]) also suggests that Broad\u2019s account is\nafflicted by a problem of \u201crepeated contents\u201d.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2 Repetitions and Divergences.\n[An\n extended description of Figure 6.2\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nA further problem stems from the fact that on Broad\u2019s account\nthe periods during which we are continuously aware of contents can\nhave a greater temporal extension than the contents themselves.\nReturning to\n Figure 6.2\n the experience of the flash unfold over the very brief interval\ne shown in the diagram. The duration d stretches\nfrom A1 to A2 and corresponds to the entire period of time the subject\nwas aware of the flash. As can be seen the interval d is\nconsiderably longer than e. Since contents that are\napprehended by acts of awareness appear to be present, this means\nthat\u2014if Broad\u2019s account is correct\u2014brief events are\nexperienced as present for considerably longer periods than they\nactually are present. By allowing us to experience an interval in an\ninstant (or something close to it) Broad renders temporal experience\nincapable of accurately reflecting the temporal properties of the\nevents we perceive. If our experience were misleading in this\nsort of way it is difficult to believe we would not notice. For\nfurther discussion of these aspects of Broad\u2019s model see Dainton\n(2000 [2006: 6.2]), Tye (2003), Phillips (2010) and Rashbrook (2012,\n2017).\n6.2 Further Hybrid Variations\n\nOne way for extensionalists to embrace (after a fashion) the\nstructures elaborated by retentionalists is to agree that the latter\ndo exist, and do play a role in our cognition, but at an entirely sub-\nor pre-conscious level. On this view, retentions (and perhaps\nprotentions) exist, but in the guise of neural mechanisms and\nprocesses that do not directly feature in consciousness. Carlos\nMontemayor (2013; Montemayor & Wittmann 2017) has defended this\nposition. Montemayor proposes that we distinguish the \u201csensorial\npresent\u201d from \u201cthe phenomenal present\u201d. The\nsensorial present represents stimuli as simultaneous, whereas the\nphenomenal present has a temporal extension of around half a second up\nto three seconds. Montemayor goes on to argue that it is a mistake to\nthink the cinematic, retentional and extensional models are mutually\nincompatible. The cinematic and retentional models correspond to his\nsensorial present, and whereas the (extensional) phenomenal present is\nphenomenally conscious, the sensorial present is only\naccess-conscious in Ned Block\u2019s sense. Merino-Rajme\n(2017) is impressed by the ingenuity of this proposal, but raises\ndoubts as to whether it is compatible with Block\u2019s conception of\nwhat access-consciousness involves.\n\nThomas Sattig (2019c) suggested that in his Raum und Zeit\n(1915) Anton Marty defended a hybrid model in which both retentional\nand extensional elements figure in temporal experience. Marty\u2019s\nposition is certainly intriguing, but since it confines the experience\nof change to momentary phases of experience it ultimately seems more\nretentionalist than extensionalist in character.\n\nIn a recent paper Rick Grush (2016\n [Other Internet Resources])\n distinguishes two sorts of perceptual content: A-ish content\nis structured in terms of past, present and future whereas\nB-ish content is structured in terms of earlier than,\nsimultaneous and later than. Grush points out that in discussions of\ntemporal experience it is generally (if tacitly) assumed that the\ncharacter of temporal experience has the same character at all\ntemporal scales, over short intervals of time, medium intervals and\nlong intervals. But what if this is not the case? What if our\nexperience isn\u2019t scale invariant? Grush proposes that\nat the larger temporal scales of seconds or minutes it is very\nplausible to think that our experience is A-ish in character. If you\nare watching an Olympic sprint, at around the mid-point some of the\nrace still lies in the future, some of it is in the past, and some of\nit is happening now. But perhaps it is different at smaller sub-second\ntemporal scales, and this is what Grush proposes: our experience is\nA-ish down to the scale of 200 msec, but beneath that it is B-ish:\n\n\nNo point in this interval is singled out as a now bracketed by a past\nand future. Rather, within this interval events are represented as\nstanding in relations of earlier than, simultaneous\nwith, and later than. But at scales greater than this,\nthis B-ishly structured interval of 200 msec effectively\nbecomes the bulky now of A-ish experience.\n(Grush 2016\n [OIR]:\n 8)\n\n\nGrush argues that holding that contents possess a B-ish character over\nshort intervals helps circumvent an otherwise serious \u201csurplus\ncontent\u201d problem that Dainton (2000, 2008a) has directed against\nretentional models.\n\nGerardo Viera also argues for a hybrid approach in which extensional\nand retentional (or atomist) models both have important play, but\nwhere neither applies universally, to all forms of temporal\nexperience. The grounds for this claim are scientific:\n\n\nempirical evidence suggests that temporal experience is fragmented and\ncomposed of many dissociable capacities to perceive the temporal\nstructure of our world. (Viera 2019: 33)\n\n\nViera\u2019s starting point is the current state of play in\nneuroscientific investigations into how the brain manages to keep\ntrack of time. The long-dominant assumption that the brain relies on\nthe regular beating of a single master-clock has been steadily\nundermined. If the master-clock existed and its functioning were\ndisrupted by drugs or neural damage we would expect this disruption to\nhave a devastating global impact on an individual\u2019s time-related\nabilities, but Viera points out that there are no known cases of\nneural damage which completely eliminate a person\u2019s\nability to perceive time. Coming from the other direction the\nhypothesis that timing and time perception depends on a multiplicity\nof different neural mechanisms has plenty of empirical support. When\nrapid transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is applied to the\nfrontal cortex the result is impaired timing in the second range; when\nrTMS is applied to the cerebellum timing in the millisecond range is\nimpaired. Ingesting psylocibin has no effect on the ability to\nperceive at timescales of less than 2 seconds, but severely impairs\nperception at longer timescales.\n\nIf our brains use a multiplicity of very different neural mechanisms\nwhen dealing with time then it is possible that the extensional model\napplies to some forms of temporal experience and the retentional model\nto other forms, Viera argues that this may well be the case. When it\ncomes to accounting for temporal perception at the sub-second level\nfor individual sensory modalities so-called intrinsic timing\nmodels are currently influential, these rely on the dynamics of\ntemporally extended neural processes to encode time, rather than any\nexternal clock. By way of an analogy, think of the way a pattern of\nripples on a lake carries information about the time that has elapsed\nsince a pebble was dropped. Viera suggests that any experiences this\ntype of extended neural process produces will themselves be temporally\nextended in an extensionalist manner, with the mirroring constraint\nwill be satisfied: the temporal features of successive phases of the\nneural process and the successive phases of the experience will\ncorrespond exactly. However, extensionalists don\u2019t have it all\ntheir own way. In the case of cross-modal perceptual order judgements\nat the timescale of less than one second Viera points out that there\nare cases where mirroring conspicuously fails. Experiments show that\nif a short delay is introduced between a button-pressing and a flash\nof light the two events seem to be occurring closer together in time\nthan they in fact are\u2014in some cases the ordering of the stimuli\nseems to be entirely reversed (Viera 2019: 39\u201340).\n\nViera draws an ambitious conclusion from these results: since the\nmirroring constraint is violated\n\n\nwe have a counterexample to extensionalism, and therefore neither\natomism nor extensionalism can provide us with a general theory for\nhow the temporal contents of experience relate to the temporal\nstructure of experience. (2019: 41)\n\n\nIt would be more accurate to hold that the cross-modal temporal order\njudgement case presents a potential problem for extensionalists who\nare committed to a very strict form of mirroring. Viera\u2019s\nargument poses no threat to extensionalists who are prepared to\nacknowledge that mirroring may sometimes fail to hold at shorter\ntime-scales.\n\nOn a number of occasions Ian Phillips (2010, 2018) has suggested that\na different sort of hybrid theory may well be worth taking seriously.\nPhillips proposes that the extensional and retentional approaches have\nmore in common than has usually been realized: there are grounds for\nthinking that both essentially depend on a form of memory.\nThe kind of memory Phillips has in mind is not the sort we can call up\nhours, days or months after the event we are\nrecollecting\u2014critics of the Reid-type memory theories are right\nto point out that memories of this kind are too unlike perception to\nfigure in temporal experience. The relevant type of memory is what\nJames called primary or elementary:\n\n\nan object of primary memory \u2026 never was lost; its date was\nnever cut off in consciousness from that of the immediately present\nmoment. In fact it comes to us as belonging to the rearward portion of\nthe present space of time, and not to the genuine past. (James 1890:\n646\u20137)\n\n\nPhillips argues that primary memory properly understood, is perceptual\nin character, and so capable of playing a role in role in experiences\nof succession by providing us with a direct link to the immediate\npast. Phillips takes his \u201crefined memory theory\u201d to be a\nmemory-based version of extensionalism. But he also proposes that,\nproperly understood, Husserl\u2019s theory is very similar:\nHusserl\u2019s retentions are also constitutively connected to the\npast, and by virtue of that could not exist in a momentary episode of\nconsciousness lacking that connection to the past. Adopting this\nperspective, Phillips argues, sheds valuable light on the entire\nfield. For it suggests that the fundamental division is between those\nwho those who claim\n\n\nthat it is only because our experience is a process which\nunfolds in time that it can acquaint us with the temporal structure of\nreality as it does.\u2026 (Phillips 2018: 17)\n\n\nand those who deny this. Phillips proposes that if we view matters\nthus\n\n\n\u2026 theorists who we might initially conceive of as rivals,\nnamely extensionalists such as Dainton, and retentionalists such as\nHusserl and O\u2019Shaughnessy, do not obviously disagree on\nsubstance. (2018: 21)\n\n\nBy way of further elaboration Phillips suggests the relation of\nco-consciousness which Dainton invokes to unify earlier and later\nphases of experience can itself be viewed as involving a form of\nmemory.\n\nThe suggestion that Dainton\u2019s co-consciousness relation could\namount to a form of memory is an interesting issue for future\ndiscussion. That aside, Phillips\u2019 claim that there is a divide\nof a fundamental kind between those who hold that experiences of\nsuccession require a succession of experiences on the one hand, and\nthose who hold that experiences of succession do not require\na succession of experiences on the other, is very plausible.\n\nIn his discussion of Phillips\u2019 work Wolf (2021) finds much to\nrecommend, but suggests that in its current form it lacks a decisive\nadvantage over the more orthodox extensional and retentional\napproaches. The solution, Wolf suggests, is to move in a more\ndynamic\u2014more Bergsonian direction\u2014by finding a way of\nincorporating Bergson\u2019s seemingly (but not really) paradoxical\nclaim that \u201cduration is essentially a continuation of what no\nlonger exists into what does exist\u201d. Wolf suggests that once\nthis is done the result is a more appealing form of Bergsonian\nextensionalism that has greater plausibility than the competing\nversions, Phillips\u2019 included.\n7. Anti-Realisms\n\nPerhaps there is a more dramatic discrepancy between the actual\ncharacteristics of our experience, on the one hand, and our\nbeliefs about these characteristics on the other, than\nanything we have considered up to now. True, we do talk as though we\nsee things move (and more generally, perceive change), and doubtless\nthis talk reflects our beliefs, but perhaps our beliefs are simply\nwrong. Perhaps our immediate experience is in reality entirely\nmotion-free, and our streams of consciousness radically fragmented,\nbut since we do not believe our experience is like this, we do not\ntalk as though it is.\n\nA position along these lines has been advocated by Dennett. If asked\nwhether our typical visual fields are fully continuous, even when one\nof our eyes is closed, most of us are inclined to answer in the\naffirmative: when we look at (say) a white wall, we see an\nuninterrupted expanse of white. In such cases we are unable to detect\na beachball-sized fuzzy dark expanse lying just to one side of the\ncentral axis of vision. But the physiology of the eye suggests there\nshould be a \u201cblind spot\u201d at that location, corresponding\nto the region of the retina occupied by the optic nerve which is\ndevoid of light-sensitive cells. As for why we do not detect a blind\nregion in our visual field, the standard\u2014and on the face of it,\nplausible\u2014answer is that our visual systems engage in some\n\u201cperceptual interpolation\u201d or filling-in: our\nbrains extrapolate from the stimuli reaching the light-sensitive cells\nin the region of the retina immediately surrounding the blind-spot,\nand fabricate experience to fill the relevant region of the visual\nfield accordingly.\n\nDennett points out that there is alternative to this account. Rather\nthan \u201cmaking up\u201d experience in this manner, perhaps our\nbrains simply fail to notice that there is a lack of visual\ninformation deriving from the hole region: after all, an absence of\ninformation is not the same thing as information about an absence.\nNever having received information from this region, the brain simply\nworks on the assumption that nothing special is going on there:\n\n\nThe brain doesn\u2019t have to \u201cfill in\u201d for the blind\nspot, since the region in which the blind spot falls is already\nlabelled (e.g., \u201cplaid\u201d \u2026 \u201cmore of the\nsame\u201d). (1991: 335)\n\n\nIn effect, since we have a belief about what the blind region\ncontains\u2014typically, \u201cmore of the same\u201d\u2014why\nshould the brain go to the trouble of generating experience as well?\nDennett goes on to suggest that this treatment of spatial holes can\nplausibly be extended to temporal holes (gaps in the continuity of\nexperience) also. Our visual experience is constantly interrupted by\nour eyes darting about during saccades. We don\u2019t notice the\nresulting holes or gaps in our experience, but they don\u2019t need\nto be filled in because we\u2019re not designed to notice them. More\ngenerally:\n\n\nOne of the most striking features of consciousness is its\ndiscontinuity\u2014as revealed in the blind spot, and the\nsaccadic gaps, to take the simplest examples. The discontinuity of\nconsciousness is striking because of the apparent continuity\nof consciousness. (1991: 356)\n\n\nAlthough Dennett himself concentrates on explaining why we are\ninclined to describe our experience as continuous if it is really\ndiscontinuous, the approach can be extended to the immediate\nexperience of change, or so Chuard argues (2011: 17) Suppose the\n\u201csuccession of static snapshots\u201d conception of experience\nas proposed by the cinematic theorist is correct. Provided the\ncontents and temporal arrangement of these static snapshots are enough\nto convince our brains that we are perceiving motion and change, we\nwill inevitably believe that this is what we are perceiving,\nand hence describe our experience in such terms. Isn\u2019t\nthis all that we are required to explain? For Dennett and Chuard\nnothing further is needed.\n\nAs noted in\n \u00a71.3\n it is possible to be a realist about the experience of change and\nsuccession but an anti-realist about the dynamic features that some\nrealists claim to be a pervasive feature of our experience. Thomas\nSattig falls into this camp. Sattig is a realist about the experience\nof change and succession:\n\n\n\u2026 I do not merely infer that the leave has moved, from\nmemories of previously experienced momentary leaf-states. I just\nsee that motion occurs. (Sattig 2019a: 275)\n\n\nSattig doesn\u2019t reject all forms of flow, and has\ndeveloped an account of it grounded in phenomenal\nreplacement:\n\n\n\u2026 I see that each momentary leaf-state is immediately replaced\nby another one like water flowing through a river bed, where each\nportion of water is immediately replaced by a new portion. (Sattig\n2019b: \u00a71)\n\n\nIn reducing the experience of motion to successions of momentary\nperceptions of objects at different locations he appreciates that some\nrealists will find that his account fails to do justice to the dynamic\nnature of phenomenal flow:\n\n\nPrimitivists about the phenomenal whoosh of flow will not\naccept this phenomenological analysis, nor will they accept any other\n\u2026 But I have yet to encounter an alternative phenomenological\ndescription that reaches substantially beyond the usual, opaque\nflow-metaphors. (2019b: \u00a74)\n\n\nOthers are still more sceptical, arguing that realists who believe in\nexperiential flow or passage are deluded about the character of their\nown experience: flow isn\u2019t a real feature of our experience, we\nmerely (and falsely) believe that it is. Hoerl (2014) adopts this\nline, arguing that it is a mistake to suppose that the experience of\nseeing a moving object involves anything more than seeing the object\nat a succession of different locations\u2014also see Braddon-Mitchell\n(2014). In a similar but more general vein K. Miller, Holcombe, and\nLatham (2020) suggest that we may well be inclined to attribute\ndynamic features to our experience which it in fact lacks, and propose\ntwo cognitive mechanisms which may underlie this inclination.\n8. Temporal Consciousness and the Metaphysics of Time\n8.1 Competing Conceptions of Time\n\nIf there are very different accounts of the nature of temporal\nexperience, the same applies to time itself\u2014the time which\nexists in the wider physical universe, rather than time confined to\nhuman consciousness. Let us take a brief look at these differing\nconceptions before considering the complex issue of how universe-time\nand experienced-time are related.\n\nOne central issue concerning universe-time can be encapsulated is this\nsimple question: \u201cDoes time pass?\u201d Temporal passage can be\ncharacterized in a number of ways, but at the very least passage is\nassociated with the idea that the present is metaphysically privileged\nand steadily advancing, and this advance entails that future times\nwill become present, that present times and events will become past,\nand that past times become ever more past with every passing\nmoment. But while few deny that time seems to pass\u2014and indeed,\nthat this passage is (along with dimensionality) the most obvious\ndifference between time and space\u2014there are many who have denied\nthat time really does pass. Of these a few share\nMcTaggart\u2019s view that time cannot pass because time does not\nexist.\n\nA more popular view, these days at least, is the view that while time\ncertainly exists, it is more akin to space than it superficially\nseems. Proponents of the four-dimensional \u201cblock\nuniverse\u201d\u2014also known as eternalism\u2014hold\nthat there is no ontological distinction between past, present and\nfuture, and that all times are equally real. They further hold that\nthere is no unique privileged present time, and a fortiori\nthat there is no such thing as a moving present. Block\ntheorists face a significant challenge: Why does time seem to pass if\nit doesn\u2019t? Part of the explanation lies in the way our memories\naccumulate, and intentions and decisions translate into actions (see\nIsmael 2011, 2013, 2016). Another part of the explanation lies in the\ncharacter of our experience. Time per se may not pass or\nflow, but there is something akin to passage and flow in our immediate\nexperience\u2014phenomenal passage we can call it\u2014or\nso many believe.\n\nThe block conception of time has its advantages. It has an appealing\nsimplicity, and accords well with Einstein\u2019s relativity\ntheories, to mention but two. But the rejection of objective temporal\npassage is not to everyone\u2019s taste, and other conceptions of\ntime also have their advocates. The main contenders are depicted in\n Figure 8.1\n below. At the opposite extreme to the 4-D block view is\npresentism, the doctrine that concrete reality is confined to\nthe momentary present. Presentists deny any reality to the past or\nfuture. Coming in between these extremes is the growing block\nmodel. According to the latter, the past is real but the future is\nnot, and the sum total of reality is gradually increasing, by a\nprocess of moment-by-moment absolute becoming. On this view the\npresent is merely the most recent addition to reality; it is also the\ninterface between being and non-being. The moving spotlight\nmodel is in one respect akin to the standard block model: it accords\nreality to all times and events, including those yet to occur. It\ndiffers from the latter by virtue of the fact that it incorporates\nobjective passage into the universe, in the shape of a privileged (and\nconstantly advancing) present\u2014indicated by the blue line.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1 Four conceptions of the\nlarge-scale composition of the universe. [An\n extended description of figure 8.1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nWhat McTaggart labelled the \u201cA-series\u201d runs from the\ndistant past, up through the recent past to the present, and then on\nto the future. The \u201cB-series\u201d is the series of positions\nwhich runs from earlier to later, and vice-versa. Properties such\nbeing past, present, or future are often\nknown as \u201cA-properties\u201d, whereas being earlier\nthan, being later than, and being simultaneous\nare known as \u201cB-properties\u201d or \u201cB-relations\u201d.\nThe block or eternalist conception of time is also often called\n\u201cthe B-theory\u201d. The opposed dynamic conceptions of time\nare often called \u201cA-theories\u201d.\n\nHow do these different metaphysical conceptions of time accord with\nour competing realist accounts of temporal consciousness? One point\nseems more obvious that most. If reality is confined to a momentary\npresent in the way presentists usually maintain, then it is difficult\nto see how any form of the extensional approach can be true. Our\nimmediate experience cannot extend through time if time itself has no\nextension; if earlier and later stream-phases are experienced\ntogether, in the way extensional models require, then it\nseems very plausible to suppose that these phases must both exist. Or\nto put it another way: an experience which no longer figures in the\nsum total of reality is not in a position to be part of the same\nunified state of consciousness as an experience which does so\nfigure, any more than a non-existent brick can help hold up a wall. By\ncontrast, since retentional theorists have the option of holding that\nour experience of time takes no time\u2014objectively\nspeaking\u2014their position looks to be entirely compatible with\npresentism, and similarly for the cinematic\n model.[19]\n As for the 4-D block conception, it looks equally compatible with all\nthe main views of temporal consciousness. The retentional\ntheorists\u2019 momentary specious presents can exist in universes of\nthis sort, as can those of cinematic theorists, but so too can the\nnon-momentary specious presents to be found in extensional models.\n8.2 The Argument from Experience\n\nDoes the character of temporal experience have any implications for\nthe nature of time per se? Could the dynamism we encounter in\nour temporal experience be sign of temporal passage or even a product\nof it? Does it bolster the A-theorist by providing evidence that time\nreally does pass? Claims that the passage of time features in our\nexperience are not difficult to find.\n\n\nThe best reason to believe that time passes is simply that we\nfind passage, that we are immediately and poignantly involved\nin the jerk and whoosh of process, the felt flow of one moment into\nthe next. (Williams 1951: 466)\n\n\n\nI cannot survey all the motivations philosophers have had for the\nmoving spotlight theory. But the motivation that I like best appeals\nto the nature of our conscious experience. Of all the experiences I\nwill ever have, some of them are special. Those are the ones that I am\nhaving NOW. All those others are ghostly and insubstantial. But which\nexperiences have this special feature keeps changing. (Skow 2009:\n\u00a75)\n\n\n\nI find it impossible to relinquish the sensation of a flowing time and\na moving present moment. It is something so basic to my experience of\nthe world that I am repelled by the claim that it only an illusion or\nmisperception. (Davies 1995: 275)\n\n\n\nThere is hardly any experience that seems more persistently, or\nimmediately given to us than the relentless flow of time. (Schlesinger\n1991: 427)\n\n\nGiven that there is more than one conception of what temporal passage\nitself amounts to the relationship between this sort of passage and\ntemporal experience will not be straightforward. However, Le Poidevin\nhas suggested that there is a general argument which connects the two,\nhe calls it \u201cthe argument from experience\u201d (Le Poidevin\n2007: \u00a75.1) and it can be formulated along these lines:\n\nWe have experiences that are seemingly of the passage of\ntime.\nThe best explanations of this sort of experience all rely on the\npassage of time being an objective feature of reality\nTherefore temporal passage is a real and objective feature of\nreality.\n\n\nAs Le Poidevin points out, a variety of quite different experiential\nconsiderations have been construed as linked to the passage of\ntime\u2014e.g., the perception of change and motion, the (seeming)\nconfinement of the present\u2014so there is a cluster of different\nissues which need to be investigated. Useful critical appraisals of\nthese ongoing debates include Baron et al. (2015), Deng (2013, 2018),\nFrischhut (2015), Hoerl (2014), Prosser (2007, 2012, 2013, 2016).\n\nAmong B-theorists who want to deny that time really does pass one\npopular strategy is to focus on the second premise of argument from\nexperience and find alternative explanations for experiences that are\nsuggestive of passage. L.A. Paul has argued there are well-known\nresults from psychology and the cognitive sciences which are\npotentially of great use to B-theorists seeking such\nexplanations\u2014see Paul (2010) and also Le Poidevin (2007:\n\u00a75.5). In the case of apparent motion, for example, two\nstationary flashing spots on a computer screen will be seen to be\nmoving smoothly back and forth, provided the spots are sufficiently\nclose together and the rate of flashing is not too fast or too slow.\nIn a similar fashion, the moving images on a cinema screen are a\nproduct of the ways in which our brains process the sequences of\nstatic images being projected onto the screen. Paul suggests that\nthere is a more general lesson here: much of the dynamism we are\nnaturally inclined to suppose exists in the world in reality is being\nfabricated in our brains:\n\n\nOccam's razor suggests that the flow or animated character that we\noften refer to as \u201cmotion\u201d is just a mistake. Motion is\nsimply the change of location of a persisting object, and the flow or\nanimated character that we notice and identify with motion is merely\nan effect of the brain. (Paul 2010:\n 358)[20]\n\n\nSimon Prosser is a B-theorist who has on a number of\noccasions\u2014e.g., Prosser (2000, 2007, 2012, 2013,\n2016)\u2014urged adopting a quite radical response to the argument\nfrom experience. For Prosser the idea that temporal experience could\nlend support to any form of temporal passage doctrine is radically\nmisconceived: it is in fact quite impossible. A-theories of time are\nmetaphysically incoherent and temporal passage is impossible.\nA-theoretic properties cannot exist, and cannot even be represented in\nconsciousness.\n\nIn arguing against A-theories Prosser develops and deploys \u201cthe\nDetector Argument\u201d. Smoke detectors can reliably detect the\npresence of smoke, Geiger counters can detect radiation, could there\nbe a physical device capable of detecting temporal passage, one (say)\nthat is equipped with a bulb which lights up when passage is found?\nProsser argues that such a device is impossible: \u201cthere could be\nno physical system that would detect the passage of time\u201d\n(Prosser 2016: 34). The reason for this is simple and straightforward:\nalthough defenders of A-theories of time believe that time passes,\nthey don\u2019t usually hold that passage makes a detectable\nphysical difference to objects and events, and given this it is\nhard to see how any physical device could detect the existence of\ntemporal passage. Prosser points out that the positions on the nature\nof the relationship between mind and body that are currently taken\nseriously in contemporary philosophy all posit very close connections\nbetween minds and brains: either minds are brains, or the\nmental causally depends on brain processes down to their last detail.\nGiven the nature of this relationship \u201cif no physical system can\ndetect the passage of time then neither can the human mind\u201d\n(Prosser 2016: 35) and it is impossible for temporal passage to\nregister in human experience.\n\nProsser\u2019s claim that passage makes \u201cno physical difference\nto events\u201d is questionable on a number of counts. Some\nA-theorists equate temporal passage with the\ncoming-into-being of events\u2014presentists and growing\nblock theorists fall into this category. A-theorist of this kind will\nnot find Prosser\u2019s argument persuasive. They will point out that\nif time did not pass the physical universe as we know it simply would\nnot exist. Nothing would happen, there would be no physical\ninteractions between events, no event would cause another\nevent\u2014not if causation involves an earlier event bringing a\nlater event into existence. Indeed there wouldn\u2019t even any\nevents, since events are occurrences in time, and time for the\nA-theorist essentially involves passage. For more on this line of\nresponse see Phillips (2016), Skow (2018) and Dolev\n (2019).[21]\n\nEven if we set aside A-theories of this kind problems remains. Prosser\nnotes:\n\n\nArthur Eddington, who was aware, as long ago as 1928, that no physical\nsystem could detect the passage of time, drew the conclusion that\n\u201cconsciousness, looking out through a private door, can learn by\ndirect insight an underlying character of the world which physical\nmeasurements do not betray\u201d (Eddington 1928: 91) These days,\nhowever, I do not think we can regard views of this kind as\nacceptable. (Prosser 2016: 35)\n\n\nHowever, this issue is less straightforward than Prosser suggests. In\nThe Nature of the Physical World Eddington certainly did\nclaim that the material universe is dynamically temporal in a manner\nwhich physics does not recognize, and he also held that we know this\nbecause our consciousness provides us with some access to the real\nnature of the physical world. But in making these claims he\nwasn\u2019t relying on some sort of mystical revelation concerning\nthe true nature of things. Eddington defended a version of\npanpsychism, a fact which makes him something of a hero for\ncontemporary panpsychists\u2014see Strawson (2006) and Goff\n(2017).\n\nEddington, following in Russell\u2019s footsteps, held that physics\nonly reveals the causal and structural properties of physical things,\nit tells us nothing of their intrinsic nature\u2014about the inner\nnature of the stuff they are made from. If we assume, as seems\nplausible to many, that physical things must have some\nintrinsic nature, then if physics is silent in this regard there is an\nimportant consequence: the hypothesis that the physical processes in\nour brains associated with consciousness have an experiential\nintrinsic nature will be compatible with everything physics has to\nsay. In the light of this, Eddington suggests that it would be rather\nbizarre to adopt a different hypotheses and take the intrinsic nature\nof the relevant brain processes to be non-experiential:\n\n\nIt seems rather silly to prefer to attach it [consciousness] to\nsomething of a so-called \u201cconcrete\u201d nature inconsistent\nwith thought, and then to wonder where the thought comes from.\n(Eddington 1928: 259)\n\n\nSince there is nothing special about the material in our\nbrains\u2014they\u2019re composed of the same sort of basic physical\ningredients as mountains, oceans and trees\u2014then it seems\nplausible to conclude that if brain-stuff has an experiential\nintrinsic nature then all physical stuff\n will.[22]\n\nIt\u2019s true that Colin McGinn once characterized panpsychism in an\nutterly dismissive way:\n\n\na complete myth, a comforting piece of utter balderdash \u2026\nisn\u2019t there something vaguely hippyish, i.e. stoned, about the\ndoctrine? (2006: 93)\n\n\nIt\u2019s also true that panpsychism has its share of\nproblems\u2014in common to all the other attempted solutions to\nproblem of how consciousness and the physical world are related. But\nit\u2019s also the case that in contemporary philosophy of mind\ncircles panpsychism has a respectability it hasn\u2019t had for some\ntime\u2014see Br\u00fcntrup & Jaskolla (2016) and Seager\n(2019).\n\nReturning to the detector argument, if Eddington\u2019s response has\nto be treated with respect, then Prosser\u2019s conclusion that no\nphysical system can possibly detect any form of temporal passage looks\nto be premature. If our experiences are revealing the inner intrinsic\nnatures of certain neural processes\u2014as panpsychists\nmaintain\u2014then if these experiences possess dynamic flow-type\nproperties, then these properties will belong to the physical world.\nNeural processes, are after all, physical processes. In which case\nthere is at least one way in which a physical system can detect one\nform of temporal passage.\n\nThis point also has a more general metaphysical significance. If\npanpsychism is true then everything in the universe is enjoying some\nform of consciousness. If (as many suppose) consciousness is\nessentially temporal, then if panpsychism is true everything in the\nuniverse will be enjoying a temporal form of consciousness. In which\ncase the competing accounts of the structure of temporal experience\nare competing accounts of the nature of reality as a whole\u2014in\nmuch the way Bergson suggested, a century or so ago.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Albertazzi, Liliana, 1994, \u201cThe <em>Psychological</em>\nWhole.
