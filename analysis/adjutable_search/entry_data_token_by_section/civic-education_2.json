    "main_text": "The Good Citizen: Historical Conceptions || Classical Liberalism\n1.2 Classical Liberalism\n\nAncient and medieval thinkers generally assumed that good government\nand good citizenship were intimately related, because a regime would\ndegenerate unless its people actively and virtuously supported it.\nAristotle regarded his Politics and his Ethics as\npart of the same subject. In his view, a city-state could not be just\nand strong unless its people were virtuous, and men could not exercise\nthe political virtues (which were intrinsically admirable, dignified,\nand satisfying) unless they lived in a just polity. Civic virtue was\nespecially important in a democratic or mixed regime, but even in a\nmonarchy or oligarchy, people were expected to sustain the political\ncommunity. \n\nToday, the view that the best life is one of active participation in a\ncommunity that relies on and encourages active engagement is often\ncalled \u201ccivic republicanism,\u201d and it has been developed by\nauthors like Wolin (1989), Barber (1992) and Hannah Arendt.\n\nClassical liberal thinkers, however, saw serious drawbacks to making\ngood government dependent on widespread civic virtue. First, any\ndemanding and universal system of moral education would be\nincompatible with individual freedom. If, for example the state forced\npeople to enroll their children in public schools in order to create\ngood citizens, it would hamper parents and young people\u2019s\nindividual freedom.\n\nThe second problem was more practical. States did not have a very good\nrecord of producing moral virtue in rulers or subjects. Mandatory\nchurch membership, state-subsidized education, and even public\nspectacles of torture and execution did not reliably prevent\ncorruption, sedition and other private behavior injurious to the\ncommunity. \n\nThomas Hobbes is sometimes described as a forerunner of liberalism\n(despite his advocacy of absolute monarchy) because he held a dim view\nof human nature and thought that the way to prevent political disaster\nwas to design the government right, not to try to improve civic\nvirtue. He also held that a good government was one that permitted\npeople to live their own lives safely. Another strong critic of the\nidea that a good society depended on civic virtue was Bernard\nMandeville, who wrote a famous 1705 poem entitled, \u201cThe Fable of\nThe Bees: or, Private Vices, Public Benefits.\u201d Mandeville argued\nthat a good society could arise from sheer individual self-interest if\nit was organized appropriately. \n\nOther classical liberal thinkers typically favored some degree of\ncivic education and civic virtue, even as they proposed limitations on\nthe state and a strong private sphere to reduce the dependence of the\nregime on civic virtue. In other words, they steered a middle course\nbetween pure classical liberalism and civic republicanism. For\nexample, in his \u201cInstructions for the conduct of a young\nGentleman, as to religion and government,\u201d John Locke wrote that\na gentleman\u2019s \u201cproper calling is the service of his\ncountry, and so is most properly concerned in moral and political\nknowledge; and thus the studies which more immediately belong to his\ncalling are those which treat of virtues and vices, of civil society\nand the arts of government, and will take in also law and\nhistory.\u201d That was an argument for civic education. But it\nappeared in a minor, unpublished fragment. Civic education was not a\nsignificant theme in Locke\u2019s important treatise Some Thoughts\nConcerning Education, which was more about teaching individuals to\nbe free and responsible in their private lives. Likewise, the emphasis\nof his political writing was on limiting the power of the state and\nprotecting private rights.\n\nJames Madison hoped for some degree of civic virtue in the people and\nespecially in their representatives. He endorsed \u201cthe great\nrepublican principle, that the people will have the virtue and\nintelligence to select men of virtue and wisdom. Is there no virtue\namong us? If there be not, we are in a wretched situation. No\ntheoretical checks--no form of government can render us secure\u201d\n(Madison, 1788, 11:163) On the other hand, Madison proposed a whole\nseries of reforms that would make government proof against the various\nvices that seemed to be \u201csown in the nature of man\u201d\n(Madison, Hamilton, and Jay, Federalist 10). These tools included\nconstitutional limitations on the overall power and scope of\ngovernment; independent judges with power of review; elections with\nrelatively broad franchise; and above all, checks and balances. \n\nMadison explained that republics should be designed for people of\nmoderate virtue, such as might be found in real societies.\n\u201cIf men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels\nwere to govern men, neither external nor internal controuls on\ngovernment would be necessary.\u201d Unfortunately, neither citizens\nnor rulers could be counted on to act like angels; but good government\nwas possible anyway, as long as the constitution provided appropriate\ncontrols. \n\nThe main \u201cexternal controul\u201d in a republic was the vote,\nwhich made powerful men accountable to those they ruled. However,\nvoting was not enough, especially since the voters themselves might\nlack virtue and wisdom. \u201cA dependence on the people is no doubt\nthe primary controul on the government; but experience has taught\nmankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.\u201d In general,\nMadison\u2019s \u201cauxiliary precautions\u201d involved dividing\npower among separate institutions and giving them the ability to check\none another.\n\nThis policy of supplying by opposite and rival interests, the defect\nof better motives, might be traced through the whole system of human\naffairs, private as well as public. We see it particularly displayed\nin all the subordinate distributions of power; where the constant aim\nis to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that\neach may be a check on the other; that the private interest of every\nindividual may be a centinel over the public rights. These inventions\nof prudence cannot be less requisite in the distribution of the\nsupreme powers of the state. (Madison, Hamilton, and Jay, Federalist\n51)\n\n",
