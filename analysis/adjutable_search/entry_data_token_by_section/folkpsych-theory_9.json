    "main_text": "Philosophical Challenges to Theory Theory || Simulation Theory\n4.2 Simulation Theory\n\nSince the mid-1980s the main rival to TT has been the simulation\ntheory, or ST, of which there are many varieties. The major proponents\nof ST diverge in their views about what exactly simulation involves.\nThey heterogeneously characterize the process of simulation as a form\nof imaginative transformation (Gordon 1986, 1995, 1996), thought\nreplication or co-cognition (Heal 1986, 1995, 1996, 1998a, 1998b),\nintrospective modeling (Gopnik & Wellman 1992) and off-line\npractical reasoning (Goldman 1989, 2006).\n\nSimulation theorists take it for granted that we regularly engage in\nFP, but they hold that doing so does not imply the existence of a set\nof conceptually articulated ToM principles. They propose that as our\nminds are already populated with the relevant mental states and that\nwe can systematically manipulate those mental states in precisely the\nsorts of ways TT principles aim to describe. Proponents of ST also\npropose that when we make mentalistic attributions to other minds we\nuse our minds as models for those targets. Thus, even though the\nsimulation process is a structured activity involving the attribution\nof mental state concepts, no theoretical principles need to be\nconsulted or used when we understand minds in FP fashion.\n\nGoldman (2006), for example, depicts high-level mindreading of the\nsort associated with FP understanding as a three-stage process. In the\nprimary or preparatory phase, appropriate targets must be identified\n(viz. intentional actions or what at least looks to be such). During\nthe second, or what might be called the simulative phase, appropriate\ninputs\u2014\u201cpretend\u201d thoughts, beliefs, or desires (or\nthe same entertained hypothetically)\u2014are \u201cfed into\u201d\nspecific subpersonal mechanisms (e.g., the practical reasoning\nmechanism operating in an off-line mode). These mental states are then\ninternally manipulated to yield predictions or explanations.\n\nMentalistic concepts are not needed for the first two stages of the\nprocess. But they come into play when attributing mental states to\ntargets in the final phase. Making such attributions requires\nidentifying which mental states it is that one is\nascribing\u2014these must be classified both by appeal to their\ngeneral attitudinal type (belief, desire, hope) and their specific\ncontent (e.g., that \u201cThe bus leaves from stand 25\u201d.).\n\nTo the extent that simulation processes might exhaustively explain our\nFP abilities, ST directly challenges TT explanations. ST offers to\nexplain how FP ascriptions can be carried off without positing any\nkind of \u201ctheory\u201d as being involved in the central\nmindreading process. Motivated by the acknowledgment of some\nlimitations of pure TT accounts (see Heal 1998a, 1998b), some TTists\nhave come to favor hybrid explanations of the cognitive basis of FP in\nwhich both theory and simulation have clear-cut parts to play in\nachieving FP understanding (Goldman 2006). Yet however this alliance\nis precisely conceived, there remains a crucial question about which,\nif either, of the two theories\u2014TT or ST\u2014does the work of\nexplaining the core structural aspects of our FP competence (see\nApperly 2008 for a critique of the explanatory value of both\napproaches).\n",
