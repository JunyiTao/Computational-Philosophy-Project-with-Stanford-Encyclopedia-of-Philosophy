    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n Grosseteste was born into a humble Anglo-Norman family in the\ncounty of Suffolk in England.  He first appears in the historical\nrecord as a witness to a charter of the Bishop of Lincoln, written\nbetween 1189 and 1192.  His title of master of arts indicates that he\nhad acquired sufficient learning to be entitled to teach.  Assuming\nthat Grosseteste would therefore have been in his early twenties,\nCallus 1955 has suggested a birth date around 1168.  Around 1195, in a\nletter of recommendation to the Bishop of Hereford, William de Vere,\nGerald of Wales commends Grosseteste for his wide reading and skill in\nbusiness and legal affairs, medicine, and the liberal arts, and\nremarks on his exceptional standards of conduct.  Grosseteste appears\nas a witness to several of de Vere\u2019s charters over the next few years,\nbut disappears from the historical record after de Vere\u2019s death in\n1198. He reappears as a papal judge-delegate in Litchfield diocese\nbefore 1216 and in Hereford diocese between 1213 and 1216, acting with\nHugh Foliot, Archdeacon of Shropshire. Grosseteste\u2019s name reappears\ntwice more in legal documents connected with Shropshire before 1227.\nFor at least part of the years 1208 to 1213, when England was under\npapal interdict, Grosseteste was in France, for in a death-bed\nconversation reported by the chronicler Matthew Paris he recalls\nhaving seen and heard preaching in France Eustace of Flay, James of\nVitry, Robert of Courson and the exiled Archbishop Steven Langton.  In\n1225, while still a deacon, Grosseteste was presented by the Bishop of\nLincoln, Hugh of Wells, to the living of Abbotsley; in 1229 he was\nmade Archdeacon of Leicester and presented with a prebend in Lincoln\nCathedral. In 1229/1230 Grosseteste accepted an invitation to become\nthe first lecturer to the Oxford Franciscans.  In 1235 he was elected\nBishop of Lincoln, a position he occupied until his death in 1253.\n Besides the facts just mentioned, and despite confident statements\nabout his early life in much of the literature, we know very little\nabout Grosseteste\u2019s life before about 1230. He no doubt was educated\nin the liberal arts in England, possibly at Lincoln, and he probably\nstudied in the late twelfth century at Hereford, then a center of\nscientific learning.  He is thought to have studied theology in the\nearly thirteenth century, though exactly where and when is a matter of\ndisagreement, as is the related question of his relation to the then\nnascent Oxford University.\n Scholars have proposed different hypotheses regarding\nGrosseteste\u2019s life between about 1200 and 1230.  According to Daniel\nCallus (Callus 1945, 1955, with Crombie 1953 and McEvoy 1982, 2000 in\nsubstantial agreement), from about 1200 Grosseteste probably taught\nthe arts at Oxford, only to leave Oxford in 1209 to study theology in\nFrance when the Oxford schools closed after some clerics were hanged by\nOxford\u2019s mayor and officers. The resolution of the resulting\ntown-and-gown dispute was delayed by the papal interdict of England\nbut finally achieved in 1214, when the papal legate sent to England to\nnegotiate a settlement between the king and pope visited Oxford.  The\nlegate\u2019s resolution, known as the Legatine Award, placed the Oxford\nmasters under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Lincoln, who was to\nappoint as his representative a chancellor of the university. Remarks\nby Hugh Sutton, Grosseteste\u2019s successor as Bishop of Lincoln, indicate\nthat Grosseteste had at one time occupied the position of chancellor\nat Oxford but had been allowed only to use the title \u201cmaster of\nthe schools\u201d and not \u201cchancellor.\u201d According to\nCallus, Grosseteste probably returned from France in 1214 to become,\nin function if not title, Oxford\u2019s first chancellor, and lectured on\ntheology in Oxford\u2019s secular schools from this year until\n1229/30.\n By contrast, Sir Richard Southern (1986) argued that until 1225\nGrosseteste more likely occupied a provincial administrative position,\nperhaps supplemented by occasional short periods of teaching, possibly\neven at Oxford, among other places. His time in France was in\nconsequence of the interdict rather than the closure of the Oxford\nschools, and was not spent in the study of theology.  According to\nSouthern, Grosseteste\u2019s permanent association with Oxford began after\n1225, when, having received the prebend of Abbotsley, Grosseteste\nprobably became a priest and began to lecture in theology. According\nto Southern\u2019s chronology, he would have become chancellor in the late\n1220s.\n Southern\u2019s important study had the salutary effect of forcing a\nreexamination of the assumptions upon which earlier accounts of\nGrosseteste\u2019s life rested, but his conclusions remain\ncontentious. Joseph Goering, after looking closely at the content of\nGrosseteste\u2019s writings and the documentary evidence, concludes that\n\u201cthe evidence intimates that he was on the continent along with the\nbishop of Hereford and other English Churchmen in exile before 1215,\nthat he returned to the diocese of Hereford when the interdict was\nlifted, and that he continued his diocesan service and his teaching as\na master of arts, at Hereford or elsewhere, into the 1220s\u201d (Goering\n1995, 26).  Yet Goering thinks that the sources used in Grosseteste\u2019s\ntheological writings, as well as Grosseteste\u2019s known ties with\nimportant Parisian thinkers, best support the view that Grosseteste\u2019s\nstudy of scholastic theology\u2014a casual and gradual process in his\nview\u2014included at least some time studying in Paris in the 1220s,\npossibly around 1225 after receiving his substantial prebend in\nAbbotsley, which made (and perhaps was intended to make) such a course\nof study possible. Goering observes that there is no concrete evidence\nthat Grosseteste taught at Oxford prior to the late 1220s or that his\nteaching in the secular schools at Oxford was in theology rather than\nthe arts.  Grosseteste\u2019s association with Oxford and chancellorship\nmay indeed have only been in the late 1220s as a master of arts\u2014the\nfact that he was a master in the lower faculty of arts, not the higher\nfaculty of theology, would perhaps explain why he was not permitted to\nbe called chancellor.\nMore recently James Ginther (Ginther 2000) has argued that\nGrosseteste became regent master of theology ca. 1229/30, around the\ntime he became lecturer to the Oxford Franciscans. Ginther claims that\nGrosseteste\u2019s Dictum 19 in fact records Grosseteste\u2019s\ninception sermon at Oxford as regent master of theology. Brett Smith\n(Smith 2018, n. 34), however, has recently expressed some doubts over\nGinther\u2019s claims, and the question of Grosseteste\u2019s career before\nca. 1229/30 remains unresolved among scholars.\n\n\n In 1229/30 Grosseteste began a formal association with the\nFranciscans at Oxford as their first lecturer.  The Franciscans had\narrived at Oxford in 1224. Their Minister Provincial, Agnellus of\nPisa, provided this small but growing group with their first school\nand requested that Grosseteste lecture to them.  Grosseteste\u2019s high\nregard for the mendicants no doubt played a role in his acceptance of\nthis request. Some indeed thought that Grosseteste would himself\nfollow the path of many other eminent scholars of his day and join the\nFranciscan order, but this was not to be. Instead, in 1235 he was\nelected Bishop of Lincoln. He was not the electors\u2019 first choice but\nrather a compromise candidate, but he went on to become a powerful and\nexacting bishop.  Grosseteste\u2019s teaching career was over, but he\ncontinued to enjoy close relations with the Franciscans for the rest\nof his life. They were members of his episcopal household and he\nemployed them as assistants and bequeathed his books to them. These\nbooks, kept in the Oxford Franciscan convent library, were to become\nan important source for later thinkers\u2019 knowledge of Grosseteste\u2019s\nteachings.\n In 1231, after recovering from serious illness, Grosseteste\nresigned all his sources of revenue, save his prebend in Lincoln\ncathedral.  He went on to compose a series of important theological\nworks, the most notable being his Hexa\u00e6meron, a long\ncommentary on Genesis 1:1\u20132:17.  A feature of these theological works\nis Grosseteste\u2019s increasing knowledge of ancient Greek. Just when\nGrosseteste began to study Greek is not known, but his studies appear\nto have been under way by the early 1230s (see Dionisotti 1988).\nAided by assistants proficient in Greek, Grosseteste became one of the\nvery few thinkers in the Latin West to know the language. He was not\ncontent, however, to employ his Greek learning simply as an aid in his\ntheological studies, but he also embarked on important projects of\ntranslation of Greek works into Latin.  The first of these projects,\ncommenced after about 1235, focused on works by the theologian, John\nof Damascus.  In the late 1230s and early 1240s, Grosseteste turned to\nthe writings of the Pseudo-Dionysius. He completed a new translation\nof the Pseudo-Dionysius\u2019s works, to which he added his own original\ncommentary.  Grosseteste had also retained philosophical interests and\nin the 1240s turned again to the writings of Aristotle, with whose\nworks he had engaged as a commentator in the 1220s. He made the first\nextant complete Latin translation of the Nicomachean Ethics\nto circulate in the Latin West, as well as translations of a large\nbody of accompanying Greek commentary materials, some of which he\nsupplemented, where they were lacking, with his own original\ncommentary and notes.  Grosseteste also translated, apparently very\nlate in life, at least substantial parts of Aristotle\u2019s De\ncaleo and Simplicius\u2019s commentary on it.  \nThe 1240s also marked an important period of ecclesiastical\nactivity.  Conflict between the papacy and Emperor Frederick II had\nled Pope Innocent IV to flee to Lyon in 1244 and relocate the papal\ncourt there until 1251.  In hope of resolving this conflict, among\nother pressing concerns, Innocent convened the First Council of Lyon\nin 1245.  Grosseteste was included among the English delegation.\nGrosseteste returned to the papal court in 1250. Addressing the pope\nand cardinals, he bemoaned the failings of the church, which he\nlocated in its deviation from its pastoral mission. Grosseteste placed\nthe blame for this state of affairs squarely at the feet of the papal\ncourt, suggesting that if matters continued on their present course\nthe pope would not be due obedience.  In 1253, the last year of his\nlife, in a famous and angry letter to the pope (letter # 128),\nGrosseteste did indeed in no uncertain terms refuse to obey the pope\u2019s\ninstructions to confer a benefice on one of the pope\u2019s nephews, whom\nhe viewed as unfit for the pastoral care.  \nGrosseteste died on October 8\u20139, 1253.  His English contemporaries\nremembered him as a saintly man. Three attempts were made to have him\ncanonized, the last in 1307; all failed. \n",
