    "main_text": "Origins of the Medieval Discussion || The Many Varieties of Insolubles\n1.4 The Many Varieties of Insolubles\n\nThe medievals discussed many more insolubles than the Liar Paradox,\nthough most can be seen as variants of it. One common variant was what\nis now called the \u2018yes\u2019-\u2018no\u2019 paradox: Socrates\nsays \u201cWhat Plato is saying is false\u201d, while Plato says\n\u201cWhat Socrates is saying is true\u201d (see, e.g., Buridan\n[B-SD]: 974). There is also the \u2018no\u2019-\u2018no\u2019\nparadox, where Plato instead says \u201cWhat Socrates is saying is\nfalse\u201d (Buridan [B-SD]: 971). There is even a\n\u2018no\u2019-\u2018no\u2019-\u2018no\u2019 paradox, where\nSocrates says that Plato is saying something false, Plato that Cicero\nis saying something false and Cicero that Socrates is saying something\nfalse (Albert [AS-I]: 353). There are conjunctive insolubles, e.g.,\n\u201cGod exists and some conjunction is false\u201d, where God has\nannihilated any other conjunction, and disjunctive insolubles, e.g.,\n\u201cA man is an ass or some disjunction is false\u201d, where God\nhas instead annihilated any other disjunctive proposition (Albert\n[AS-I]: 357\u20138). There is also a nice example where a landowner\nhas decreed that only those who speak truly will be allowed across his\nbridge and those who lie about their business will be thrown in the\nwater (or maybe even hanged on the nearby gallows). When Socrates is\nchallenged on coming to the river, he says \u201cYou will throw me in\nthe water\u201d (Bradwardine [B-I]: 135; Buridan [B-SD]: 993; see\nalso Cervantes Don Quixote, vol. II book III ch. XIX, p.\n714).\n\nThe medievals discovered what is now usually referred to as\nCurry\u2019s Paradox, in the form \u201cIf this conditional is true\nthen a man is an ass\u201d (see Read 2002: section 9), or in its\ncontraposed form, \u201cIf God exists then some conditional is\nfalse\u201d (where this is the only conditional: Albert [AS-I]: 359);\nor in the form of an inference (consequentia), nowadays\ndubbed \u201cV-Curry\u201d, \u201cThis inference is valid so you\nare an ass\u201d (see the discussion in\n Section 3.9\n below). There were also epistemic paradoxes, such as \u201cYou do\nnot know this proposition\u201d (Bradwardine [B-I]: 139): you do not\nknow it, for if you did, it would be true and you would not know it.\nBut now you must realise that you do know it. Such insolubles can\ninvolve doubt as well as knowledge, e.g., \u201cSocrates knows the\nproposition written on the wall to be doubtful to him\u201d (see\n note 32).\n Further insolubles arise from the medieval theory of (logical)\n Obligations,\n e.g., \u201cSomething proposed is denied by you\u201d (Bradwardine\n[B-I]: 125), and \u201cThe king is sitting or a disjunctive doubt is\nproposed\u201d (Bradwardine [B-I]: 151)\u2014in the theory of\nobligations, the respondent is taken never to know whether the king is\nsitting.\n",
