    "main_text": "Token Causation || Relata\n1.1 Relata\n\nClaims like 1 describe a relation which holds between token\ncauses and effects\u2014but what are token causes and effects? What\nare the relata of the token causal relations described by claims like\n1? One popular view is that token causes and effects are\nevents (Davidson 1963, 1967; Kim 1973; Lewis 1986b\u2014see\nthe entry on\n events).\n Others hold that token causes and effects are facts (Bennett 1988;\nMellor 1995\u2014see the entry on\n facts).\n Within the causal modeling approach (see the entry on\n causal models),\n it is often assumed that causes and effects are the values of\nvariables (Hitchcock 2001a; Woodward 2003; Halpern & Pearl\n2005; Hall 2007; Halpern 2016a). One also finds support for other\nrelata like conditions (J. L. Mackie 1965), event\nallomorphs (Dretske 1977), tropes (Campbell 1990),\nstates of affairs (Armstrong 1997; Dowe 2000: ch. 7),\nsituations (Menzies 1989a), and aspects (Paul 2000).\nAllegiances are complicated by disagreements over what events, facts,\nand these other creatures are. For instance, for both Bennett and\nMellor, facts are just states-of-affairs which obtain, bringing their\nposition in line with Armstrong\u2019s. And, amongst those who agree\nthat the causal relata are events, there is considerable disagreement\nabout what exactly events are.\n1.1.1 Events\n\nLet\u2019s begin with events. Some have proposed that events are just\nregions of spacetime (Lemmon 1966; Quine 1985). That is: they propose\nthat events are individuated by the time and place of their\noccurrence. This is a very coarse-grained view of events. According to\nit, no two distinct events can occur at the same place and time. To\nsee why some think this individuates events too coarsely,\nconsider the example form Davidson (1969): A metal ball is spun on a\nhotplate. As it rotates, the ball heats up. It heats up and rotates\nwithin precisely the same region of spacetime. So, if we individuate\nevents in terms of the time and place of their occurrence, then we\nmust say that the ball\u2019s heating up and its rotation are one and\nthe same event. But it can seem that the ball\u2019s heating up and\nits rotation differ causally. The ball\u2019s heating up caused the\nsurroundings to warm, but it does not appear that the ball\u2019s\nrotation caused the surroundings to warm. Similarly, the ball\u2019s\nbeing spun caused it to rotate, but didn\u2019t cause it to heat up.\nAnd the hotplate caused the ball to heat up, but didn\u2019t cause it\nto rotate. Moved by examples like these, Davidson (1969) suggests\nindividuating events by their causes and effects. That is, Davidson\nproposes that x and y are the same event iff, for\nevery event z, both z caused x iff\nz caused y and x caused z iff\ny caused z. The left-to-right direction of this\nbiconditional follows from the Indiscernability of Identicals, so the\nright-to-left is the substantive direction; it tells us that we should\nnot draw any more distinctions between events than are needed to\naccount for differences in causation. This imposes a constraint on how\na theory of events must relate to a theory of causation, but on its\nown, it does not tell us what events are, nor how finely they are\nindividuated. After all, without some additional claims about which\nevents are causally related, Davidson\u2019s thesis is entirely\nconsistent with the claim that the ball\u2019s rotation and its\nheating are identical.\n\nKim (1976) provides a more detailed fine-grained theory of events.\nAccording to him, events are individuated by the properties or\nrelations they involve, the objects which exemplify those properties\nor relations, and the times during which they exemplify those\nproperties or relations. For instance, the event of the ball rotating\nis the triple of the property of rotation, the object of the ball, and\nthe time interval during which the ball rotates: \u27e8is rotating,\nthe ball, t1\u2013t2\u27e9.\nAnd the event of the ball heating is the triple of the property of\nheating, the object of the ball, and the time interval during which\nthe ball heats: \u27e8is heating, the ball,\nt1\u2013t2\u27e9. These two\ntriples involve different properties, so they are different\nevents.\n\nLewis (1986b) gives a different fine-grained theory of events. On\nLewis\u2019s view, events are properties of a spacetime region. For\nLewis, properties are intensions, or classes of possible individuals.\nSo, on Lewis\u2019s view, events are classes of spacetime regions at\npossible worlds. What it is for an event to occur at a world,\nw, is for the event to contain a spacetime region from\nw. Lewis is also able to distinguish the ball\u2019s\nrotation from its heating; though these events occupy the same region\nof spacetime at the actual world, they do not necessarily co-occur. It\nis possible for the ball to heat without rotating, and it is possible\nfor the ball to rotate without heating. So the class of spacetime\nregions in which the ball rotates is not the same as the class of\nspacetime regions in which the ball heats, and if Lewis identifies the\nformer class with the event of the ball rotating, and the latter with\nthe event of the ball heating, then he may distinguish these two\nevents.\n1.1.2 Facts\n\nOne reason to be unhappy with the view that token causes and effects\nare events is that it appears that absences or\nomissions can be involved in causal relations. For instance,\nAnna\u2019s failure to water her plant may cause it to die. Here, we\nhave an absence as a token cause. Likewise, Anna\u2019s vacation may\nhave caused her to not water the plant. Here, we have an absence as a\ntoken effect. But it does not seem that absences or omissions are\nevents. They are nothings, non-occurrences, and are hence not\nidentical to any occurrent events. This motivates taking token causes\nand effects to be facts, rather than events. Even if there is\nno event which is Anna\u2019s failing to water her plant, it is\nnonetheless a fact that Anna didn\u2019t water her plant.\n\nSome are not moved by this consideration because they deny that\nabsences can be token causes and effects. For instance, Armstrong\nclaims\n\n\nOmissions and so forth are not part of the real driving force in\nnature. Every causal situation develops as it does as a result of the\npresence of positive factors alone. (1999: 17, see also Thomson 2003,\nBeebee 2004a, and Moore 2009)\n\n\nThis position doesn\u2019t necessarily preclude one from admitting\nthat absences can stand in some cause-like relation; for instance,\nDowe (2000, 2001) develops an account of ersatz causation (causation*)\nwhich relates absences, even though he denies that causation proper\never relates absences. Others are unmoved because they think that\nabsences are events. For instance, a Kimian could take Anna\u2019s\nfailure to water her plant to be her exemplification of a negative\nproperty (the property of not watering her plant) throughout some time\ninterval. Alternatively, Hart and Honor\u00e9 propose that\n\n\nnegative statements like \u201che did not pull the signal\u201d are\nways of describing the world, just as affirmative statements are, but\nthey describe it by contrast not by comparison as\naffirmative statements do. (1959 [1985: 38])\n\n\nFor example, suppose that, instead of watering the plant, Anna took a\nstroll. Then we could take \u201cAnna\u2019s failure to water her\nplant\u201d to be a contrastive way of describing Anna\u2019s\nstroll; we could then allow that the event of Anna\u2019s stroll\ncaused the plant to die.\n1.1.3 Variable Values\n\nIn contrast to the extensive literature on events and facts, there has\nbeen comparatively less discussion of the metaphysics of variables and\nvariable values. When the issue is discussed, many find it congenial\nto reduce variable values in some way or other to one of the other\nkinds of entities which have been proposed as token causal relata. In\nmany applications, binary variables (variables which take on two\npotential values, usually 0 and 1) are used for whether a certain\nevent occurs. Then, questions about what it takes for the\nvariable to take on a value can be translated into questions about\nwhat it takes for the relevant event to occur. Hitchcock (2012)\nsuggests that the values of variables be taken to be Lewsian event\nalterations. (For Lewis [2000], an alteration of an\nevent, e, is a modally fragile event\u2014an event which\nwould not occur, were it ever-so-slightly different\u2014which is not\ntoo different from e itself. Some alterations of e\nwill be ways for e to occur, and some will be ways for\ne to fail to occur, but they are all alterations of\ne.) An unabridged draft of Hall (2007, see reference for\nlink) proposes that a variable is a family of pairwise incompatible\npropositions, where each proposition is\n\n\nabout the state of a particular physical system or region of space at\nor during a particular time or time-interval.\n\n\nOn this understanding, a variable\u2019s actual value just\ncorresponds to the true proposition in the family. If we assume that\nfacts are just true propositions, we get a view on which the token\ncausal relata are just facts (of a particular kind).\n\nIn general, it seems that we can take any pre-existing view about\ntoken causes and effects and translate it into a view about variable\nvalues. For instance, take a Kimian view of events, on which, for any\nproperty F, any individual a, and any time or time\ninterval t, \u27e8F, a, t\u27e9 is\nan event. Then, we could have a view on which each value of a given\nvariable corresponds to one of these Kimian triples. What\u2019s\ndistinctive about variable values as causal relata, then, isn\u2019t\nthe individual values, but rather, how they are packaged together into\na single variable. For instance, taking the Kimian view as our point\nof departure, we could have a variable, call it who steals the\nbike, whose potential values include \u27e8steals the bike,\nSusan, t\u27e9 and \u27e8steals the bike, Alex,\nt\u27e9. Or we could have a variable, call it what Susan\nsteals, whose potential values include \u27e8steals the bike,\nSusan, t\u27e9 and \u27e8steals the canoe, Susan,\nt\u27e9. And there\u2019s a third variable, call it what\nSusan does to the bike, whose potential values include\n\u27e8steals the bike, Susan, t\u27e9 and \u27e8buys the\nbike, Susan, t\u27e9. Now, there\u2019s an additional\nmetaphysical question faced by those who think that the token causal\nrelata are variable values\u2014a question not faced by\nKim\u2014which is: are the variable values who steals the bike\n= \u27e8steals the bike, Susan, t\u27e9, what Susan\nsteals = \u27e8steals the bike, Susan, t\u27e9, and\nwhat Susan does to the bike = \u27e8steals the bike, Susan,\nt\u27e9 all the same causal relatum, or are they different?\n(For more on these kinds of questions, see\n \u00a73.1\n below.)\n\nHere is an argument (adapted from Dretske 1977) that the variable\nvalues what Susan steals = \u27e8steals the bike, Susan,\nt\u27e9 and what Susan does to the bike =\n\u27e8steals the bike, Susan, t\u27e9 should be treated\ndifferently. Suppose that the store has water-tight security, so that,\nif Susan steals anything at all\u2014be it the bike, the canoe, or\nwhat-have-you\u2014she will be arrested. Then, consider the sentences\n5 and 6 (read them with additional stress on the emphasized\nwords):\n\nSusan\u2019s stealing the bike caused her to be\narrested.\nSusan\u2019s stealing the bike caused her to be\narrested.\n\n\nAs Dretske notes, while 5 sounds false, 6 sounds true. Dretske uses\nthis to argue for token causal relata which are more fine-grained than\nevents. He calls them event allomorphs. But, if we think that\nthe causal relata are the values of variables, then it\u2019s natural\nto account for the apparent difference in truth-value between 5 and 6\nby contending that, while 5 is talking about a variable like what\nSusan steals, 6 is talking about a variable like what Susan\ndoes to the bike. But then, in order to say that 5 is false while\n6 is true, we must say that the variable value what Susan steals\n= \u27e8steals the bike, Susan, t\u27e9 is a different\ncausal relatum than what Susan does to the bike =\n\u27e8steals the bike, Susan, t\u27e9. The former caused\nSusan to be arrested, whereas the latter did not.\n1.1.4 Fineness of Grain and Causal Differences\n\nWe\u2019ve now twice encountered arguments of the following form:\n\u201cc caused e\u201d is true, but\n\u201cc* caused e\u201d is false, so it must be\nthat \u201cc\u201d and \u201cc*\u201d denote two\ndifferent causal relata. In short: where there are differences in\ncausation, there must be differences in the causal relata. Call this\nthe causal differences argument. This argument was used to\nshow that token causes cannot just be regions of spacetime\u2014for\nthen, the ball\u2019s rotation and its heating would be one and the\nsame event, but the ball\u2019s rotation differs causally from its\nheating. It was again used to show that \u201cSusan\u2019s stealing\nthe bike\u201d must be a different token cause\nthan \u201cSusan\u2019s stealing the\nbike\u201d. This second example shows us that the style of argument\ncan lead to a very fine-grained view of the causal relata. It\nis, after all, necessary that Susan steals the\nbike if and only if Susan steals the bike, so it\nlooks like this style of argument leads us to draw hyperintensional\ndistinctions between causal relata. Some may see hyperintensional\ndistinctions between causal relata as a reductio, and\nconclude that something must be wrong with the causal differences\nargument.\n\nWe could resist the argument in at least three different ways.\nFirstly, we could contend that causal claims like 5 and 6 are not in\nfact causal claims. Strevens (2008) proposes that apparently\ncausal claims like 5 and 6 are in fact causal-explanatory\nclaims. As Strevens puts it:\n\n\nclaims of the form c was a cause of\ne\u2026do not assert the existence of a raw\nmetaphysical relation between two events c and e;\nrather, they are causal-explanatory claims that assert that c\nis a part of the causal explanation for e. (2008: 4)\n\n\n(See also Davidson 1967, 1970; Strawson 1985.) On a view like this, we\ncan maintain that, while causation relates coarse-grained\nentities like regions of spacetime, causal explanation\nrelates more fine-grained entities like propositions, or events\nunder-a-description.\n\nSecondly, we could claim that \u201c\u2026causes\u2026\u201d is\nan intensional context, which does not allow the substitution\nof co-referring terms without a change of truth-value (see Anscombe\n1975; Achinstein 1975, 1983; and McDermott 1995). By way of\nexplanation: names of events are uncontroversially not\nintersubstitutable within quotation marks. From\n\u201c\u2018Caesar\u2019s crossing the Rubicon\u2019 has four\nwords\u201d and \u201cCaesar\u2019s crossing the Rubicon = The\nstart of the Roman Civil War\u201d, we cannot conclude\n\u201c\u2018The start of the Roman Civil War\u2019 has four\nwords\u201d. If we think that flanking the verb \u201cto\ncause\u201d is like appearing within quotation marks in this way,\nthen we can likewise reject the inference from \u201cTurning on the\nhotplate caused the ball\u2019s heating\u201d and \u201cThe\nball\u2019s heating = the ball\u2019s rotation\u201d to\n\u201cTurning on the hotplate caused the ball\u2019s\nrotation\u201d.\n\nThirdly, we could appeal to a kind of contrastivism on which the\ncausal relation is four-place, rather than two-place (Schaffer 2005:\n\u00a74). On this view, causal claims have the logical form\n\u201cc, rather than c*, caused e, rather\nthan e*\u201d (where c* and e* are\ncontrast causes and effects, or perhaps sets thereof). Then, we could\nsuggest that claims like 5 and 6 suggest different contrasts, which\nmake a causal difference without requiring any difference in the first\nor third argument places. In short: there are causal differences\nwithout differences in causes or effects; some causal differences are\ndue to different contrasts. This kind of view would allow us\nto retain even the very coarse theory of events from Quine (1985),\naccording to which an event is just a region of spacetime. The entry\ndiscusses contrastivism further in\n \u00a71.2.2\n below.\n1.2 Relation\n1.2.1 Instances\n\nThere are a wide variety of theories of the token causal\nrelation\u2014theories of what it takes for one event, fact, or\nwhat-have-you to be a token cause of another. This entry won\u2019t\nattempt to survey the available options. The interested reader should\nconsult the entries on\n counterfactual theories of causation,\n causation and manipulability,\n probabilistic causation,\n regularity theories of causation,\n dispositions,\n and\n mechanisms in science.\n Process theories of causation are discussed in the entries on\n causation in physics\n and\n Wesley Salmon\n (see also Dowe 1997 [2008]). Instead, this entry will survey some of\nthe most philosophically interesting and persistently troublesome\ninstances of token causation, and discuss what these\ninstances might teach us about the token causal relation.\n\nPreemption. Cases of what\u2019s been called\npreemption share a common structure: there is a backup,\nwould-be cause of e (call it \u201cb\u201d, for\nbackup). Had c not happened, the backup b\nwould have been a cause of e, but c preempted\nb, causing e to happen, and simultaneously\nmaking it so that b is not a cause of e. Here are\ntwo vignettes with this structure:\n\nSuzy has a grievance against her neighbor and wants to retaliate\nby shattering his window. Billy is also aggrieved, and tells Suzy that\nhe will throw the rock. So Suzy stays at home to establish an alibi\nwhile Billy leaves and throws a rock at the window. The rock hits and\nthe window shatters. Here, Suzy\u2019s grievance is a backup,\nwould-be cause of the window\u2019s shattering. Had Billy not been\naggrieved, Suzy would have caused the window to shatter. But she was\npreempted by Billy.\nPatricia is suffering from a terminal disease. To ease her pain,\nthe doctors give her a palliative dose of morphine. Due to a clerical\nerror, she is given too much morphine and dies from an overdose. Here,\nthe terminal disease is a backup, would-be cause of Patricia\u2019s\ndeath. Had she not been given the morphine, the disease would have\nkilled her. But the disease was preempted by the overdose of\nmorphine.\n\n\nIn cases of preemption, the nearly universally shared judgment is that\nthe \u201cpreempting\u201d c is a cause of e. For\ninstance, Billy\u2019s grievance is a cause of the window\u2019s\nshattering, and the morphine is a cause of Patricia\u2019s death.\n(There are dissenters to the consensus; Beckers and Vennekens (2017,\n2018) insist that the \u201cpreempting\u201d c is not a\ncause of e in cases like these.)\n\nThe first of these vignettes is a case of what\u2019s come to be\nknown as early preemption, whereas the second is a case of\nwhat\u2019s come to be known as late preemption. Cases of\nearly preemption have roughly the same structure as the following\n\u201cneuron diagram\u201d:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Early preemption neuron\ndiagram 1. [An\n extended description of figure 1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nHere\u2019s how to read this diagram: every circle represents a\nneuron. Associated with each neuron is a certain\ntime\u2014here, the time written beneath that neuron. A neuron can\neither fire or not fire at its designated time. If the circle is\ncolored grey, this indicates that the neuron fired. If it is colored\nwhite, this indicates that the neuron did not fire. So, in the diagram\nabove, b, c, d, and e fired, and\na did not fire. Arrows represent stimulatory\nconnections between neurons. If the neuron at the base of an arrow\nfires, then the neuron at its head will fire so long as that neuron is\nnot inhibited. The circle-headed lines represent inhibitory\nconnections between neurons. If the neuron at the base of one of these\nconnections fires, then the neuron at its head will not fire.\nSo, in the diagram above, a doesn\u2019t fire, even though\nb did, because c inhibited a.\n\nHere, \u201cc\u201d stands both for the neuron c\nand for the event of the neuron c firing (or the fact that\nc fired, or whatever), and likewise for the other letters.\nThen, this neuron diagram has the structure of preemption:\nb is a backup, would-be cause of e\u2019s\nfiring. Had c not fired, the neuron system would have looked\nlike this:\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Early preemption neuron\ndiagram 2. [An\n extended description of figure 2\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nHere, b is a cause of e. So, in the original neuron\nsystem, b is a backup, would-be cause of e; had\nc not fired, b would have been a cause of\ne, but c preempts b and causes e\nitself.\n\nAs a brief aside, some authors use neuron diagrams like these as\nrepresentational tools for modelling the causal structure of cases\ndescribed by vignettes. So, they might say that the neuron b\nrepresents whether Suzy is aggrieved, a represents whether\nSuzy throws a rock at the neighbor\u2019s window, and e\nrepresents whether the window shatters. Hitchcock (2007b) gives\nreasons to worry about this use of neuron diagrams, and argues that we\nshould instead use causal models as a representational tool (see the\nentry on\n causal models,\n and\n \u00a73.2\n below). Whatever we think about using neuron diagrams to represent\nthe causal structure of scenarios described in vignettes, there should\nbe little objection to using them to model systems of\nneurons, hooked up with stimulatory and inhibitory connections in\nthe ways indicated in the diagram (Hitchcock 2007b agrees).\nThat\u2019s how neuron diagrams will be understood here. So the\nneuron diagram isn\u2019t being used to model Suzy and Billy\u2019s\nsituation. It is used to model a very simple system of five neurons,\nand, arguably, the system of neurons has a similar causal structure to\nthe vignette involving Billy and Suzy.\n\nWhat makes cases of early preemption early is that there is\nsome time before e happens at which the backup causal chain\nis cut. In our neuron diagram, at time t2, once a\nfails to fire, the backup b no longer has any hope of being a\ncause of e\u2019s firing. So, if d had not fired\n(in violation of the neuron laws), e would not have fired. In\nthe case of Billy and Suzy, once Billy tells Suzy he\u2019s going to\nthrow a rock at the window, the potential causal chain leading from\nSuzy\u2019s grievance to the window\u2019s shattering is cut. Now\nthat\u2019s she\u2019s at home establishing an alibi, she has no\nhope of causing the window to shatter. Many counterfactual theories of\ncausation appeal to this feature of early preemption in order to\nsecure the verdict that c is a cause of e. (See, for\ninstance, Ramachandran (1997, 1998), Ganeri et al. (1996, 1998), Yablo\n(2002, 2004), Hitchcock (2001a), Halpern and Pearl (2005), Woodward\n(2003), Halpern (2016a), Andreas and G\u00fcnther (2020, 2021), and\nWeslake (ms.\u2014see Other Internet Resources).)\n\nMatters are different in cases of late preemption. What makes\ncases of late preemption late is that the causal chain from\nthe potential backup is only cut short after the effect\ne happens. There was no time prior to her death at which\nPatricia\u2019s terminal disease stopped being deadly. So, at any\ntime prior to her death by overdose, were the morphine or any of its\neffects to be taken away, Patricia would still have died from the\ndisease.\n\nMany cases of late preemption are cases in which the cause\nhastens the effect. That is, had the cause been absent, the\neffect\u2014or, in any case, something very similar to the\neffect\u2014would have happened later than it actually did. But this\nisn\u2019t an essential feature of the case. Consider the following:\nQuentin is given chemotherapy to fight his cancer. The chemotherapy\ncompromises his immune system, and after catching a flu, Quentin dies\nfrom pneumonia. It is easy to suppose that the chemotherapy prolonged\nQuentin\u2019s life. Suppose that, had he not received chemo, the\ncancer would have killed him in January. And suppose that the\npneumonia killed him in February. So the chemotherapy did not hasten\nQuentin\u2019s death; it delayed it. Nonetheless, this could easily\nbe a case of late preemption. The chemotherapy prevented the cancer\nfrom killing Quentin, but we may easily suppose that there is no time\nprior to his death at which removing the chemotherapy, or the flu, or\nthe pneumonia, would have prevented him from dying. We may easily\nsuppose that the cancer remained deadly throughout. (For more on\ncauses, hasteners, and delayers, see Bennett 1987; Lombard 1990; P.\nMackie 1992; Paul 1998a; Sartorio 2006; Hitchcock 2012; and Touborg\n2018.) The case of Quentin can easily be modified so that, had he not\nreceived chemo, he would have died at exactly the same time that he\nactually died. This version gives us a case of late preemption in\nwhich, had the cause been absent, the effect\u2014or, in any case,\nsomething very similar to the effect\u2014would have happened at the\nvery same time that it actually did.\n\nCases of preemption show us that causes need not be necessary\nfor their effects. The effect e did not depend upon its cause\nc. Had c been absent, e would still have\nhappened, due to the backup b. They moreover suggest that\nthere is something important about the process whereby causes and\neffects are connected. Both c and the backup b were\nsufficient for e to happen. What seems to make the difference\nbetween them is that there is the right kind of connecting process\nleading from c to e, and there is not the right kind\nof connecting process leading from b to e. For this\nreason, while counterfactual, probabilistic, agential, and regularity\ntheories often stumble on cases of preemption, they are more easily\ntreated by process theories.\n\nSchaffer (2000a) introduces cases of what he calls trumping\npreemption. In these cases, there is preemption even though there\nis no \u201ccutting\u201d of the backup causal process. That is:\nthere is no missing part of the process leading from the backup\nb to e, but nonetheless, b does not count\nas a cause of e because c \u201ctrumps\u201d\nb. Here are two cases like this:\n\nThe laws of magic say that the first spell cast on a given day\ngoes into effect at midnight; spells cast after the first are\nineffective. On Monday, there are only two spells cast. In the\nmorning, Merlin casts a spell to turn the prince into a frog. And in\nthe evening, Morgana casts a spell to turn the prince into a frog. At\nmidnight, the prince turns into a frog.\nThe Major outranks the Sergeant, who outranks the Corporal. The\nCorporal will follow the orders of the highest-ranking officer. The\nMajor and the Sergeant both give the Corporal the order to advance,\nand the Corporal advances.\n\n\nIn the first case, Schaffer contends that Merlin\u2019s spell caused\nthe prince to turn into a frog and that Morgana\u2019s spell did not.\nMerlin\u2019s spell, after all, was the first spell of the day, and\nthat\u2019s what the laws of magic identify as the relevant feature.\nAnd, in the second case, Schaffer contends that the Major caused the\nCorporal to advance, and the Sergeant did not. After all, the Corporal\nlistens to the orders of the highest ranking officer, and in this\ncase, that\u2019s the Major. (For further discussion, see Lewis 2000;\nHalpern & Pearl 2005; Hitchcock 2007a; Halpern & Hitchcock\n2010: \u00a74.2; and Paul & Hall 2013: \u00a74.3.4.)\n\nPrevention. Cases of preemption tend to be handled\neasily by process theories of causation, whereas counterfactual,\nmanipulation, probabilistic, and regularity theories have more\ndifficulty saying both that the preempting c is a cause of\ne and that the preempted backup b is not a cause of\ne. For, in cases of preemption, we can easily trace out the\nprocess whereby c leads to e, whereas the process\nwhich would have led from b to e was interrupted by\nc. On the other hand, process theories have more difficulty\nwith cases of prevention. Here\u2019s a case of prevention:\nover the Atlantic ocean, James Bond shoots down a missile which is\nheading for Blofield\u2019s compound, and Blofield survives\nunscathed. Bond prevented Blofield from dying. If we understand\nprevention as causation-not (c prevents e iff\nc caused it to be the case that e didn\u2019t\nhappen), then Bond caused Blofield to not die. But there does not\nappear to be any causal process leading from Bond to\nBlofield\u2014both Bond and the missile were thousands of miles\naway.\n\nSome deny that cases of prevention are genuinely causal (see Aronson\n1971; Dowe 2000; Beebee 2004a; and Hall 2004). This response could be\nfurther justified with worries about absences being effects (recall\n \u00a71.1.2).\n However, there are additional worries about the cases which Hall\n(2004) calls \u201cdouble prevention\u201d. In these cases,\nc prevents d, and, if d had happened, then\nd would have prevented e. So c prevents a\npreventer of e. For instance: Blofield launches a cyber\nattack on Europe\u2019s electrical grid, plunging the continent into\nthe dark. Had Bond not shot down the missile, it would have prevented\nBlofield from carrying out the cyber attack. So Bond prevented a\npotential preventer of the cyber attack. Here, there is an inclination\nto say that Bond was an (inadvertent) cause of the cyber attack.\nHowever, there is no connecting process leading from Bond to the cyber\nattack\u2014there is no relevant energy-momentum flow, mark\ntransmission, or persisting trope connecting them.\n\nCases of double prevention have roughly the structure of this neuron\ndiagram:\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Double prevention neuron\ndiagram. [An\n extended description of figure 3\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nAs Schaffer (2000c, 2012b) argues, many paradigm cases of causation\nturn out, on closer inspection, to be instances of double prevention.\nPam uses a catapult to hurl a rock through the window. It seems clear\nthat Pam\u2019s actions caused the window to shatter. But suppose the\ncatapult works like this: a catch prevents the catapult from\nlaunching, and Pam\u2019s releasing the catch prevents it from\npreventing the launch. Thus, the relationship between Pam\u2019s\nreleasing the catch and the shattering of the window is one of double\nprevention. Here, it is less comfortable to deny that Pam caused the\nwindow to shatter, though not all agree. Aronson denies that there is\nany causation in a similar case:\n\n\nConsider a weight that is attached to a stretched spring. At a certain\ntime, the catch that holds the spring taut is released, and the weight\nimmediately begins to accelerate. One might be tempted to say that the\nrelease of the catch was the cause of the weight\u2019s acceleration.\nIf so, then what did the release of the catch transfer to the weight?\nNothing, of course. (1971: 425)\n\n\nAronson contends that, while the release of the catch was an enabling\ncondition for the weight\u2019s acceleration, it was not strictly\nspeaking a cause of the weight\u2019s acceleration.\n\nPreemptive Prevention. There\u2019s another\ninteresting class of cases where one preventer preempts\nanother (see McDermott 1995 and Collins 2000). Here are two cases like\nthis:\n\nEither Bond or M could shoot down the missile headed for\nBlofield\u2019s compound. Bond tells M that he will do it, so M goes\nhome. Bond shoots down the missile, and Blofield survives.\nBond shoots down a missile headed for Blofield\u2019s compound.\nHowever, Blofield\u2019s compound has its own perfectly reliable\nanti-missile defense system. So, had Bond not shot the missile down,\nthe anti-missile defense system would have, and Blofield would have\nsurvived unscathed.\n\n\nBy analogy with ordinary preemption, we can call the first case an\ninstance of early preemptive prevention. Once Bond tells M\nthat he will shoot down the missile, M is no longer a potential\npreventer of the missile strike. If, at the last minute, Bond had\nchanged his mind, Blofield\u2019s compound would have been destroyed.\nIn contrast, we can call the second case an instance of late\npreemptive prevention. At no point does the missile defense\nsystem \u201cstep down\u201d, and stop being a potential preventer\nof the compound\u2019s destruction.\n\nThe first case has a structure similar to this neuron system,\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Early preemptive prevention\nneuron diagram. [An\n extended description of figure 4\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nWhereas the second case has a structure similar to this neuron\nsystem,\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Late preemptive prevention\nneuron diagram. [An\n extended description of figure 5\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThere seems to be more of an inclination to attribute causation in\ncases of early preemptive prevention than in cases of late preemptive\nprevention. As McDermott (1995) puts it: in case (2), many are\ninitially inclined to deny that Bond prevented the compound\u2019s\ndestruction; but, when they are asked \u201cOf Bond and the missile\ndefense system, which prevented the compound\u2019s\ndestruction?\u201d, it feels very natural to answer with\n\u201cBond\u201d. (As Collins 2000 notes, things begin to feel\ndifferent if we suppose that the anti-missile defense system is less\nthan perfectly reliable.)\n\nSwitches. Suppose that a lamp has two bulbs: one on\nthe left, and one on the right. There is a switch which determines\nwhether power will flow to the bulb on the left or the one on the\nright. If the power is on and the switch is set to the left, then the\nleft bulb will be on, and the room will be illuminated. If the power\nis on and the switch is set to the right, then the right bulb will be\non, and the room will be illuminated. If the power is off, then\nneither bulb will be on, and the room will be dark, no matter how the\nswitch is set. To start, the power is off and the switch is set to the\nleft. Filipa flips the switch to the right, and Phoebe turns on the\npower. The right bulb turns on, and the room is illuminated.\n\nCases like these are discussed by Hall (2000) and Sartorio (2005,\n2013), among others. This particular example comes from Pearl (2000).\nIn these kinds of cases, there are five events (or facts, or\nwhat-have-you): f, p, l, r, and\ne, with the following features: if p happens, it\nwill cause either l or r to happen, depending upon\nwhether f happens. And if either l or r\nhappens, it will cause e to happen. For instance, in our\nexample, f is Filipa flipping the switch to the right,\np is Phoebe turning on the power, l and r\nare the left and right bulbs turning on, respectively, and e\nis the room being illuminated. In this case, it can seem that\nthere\u2019s an important difference between Filipa and Phoebe.\nWhereas Filipa made a difference to how the room got\nilluminated (whether by the left bulb or the right one), she did not\nmake a difference to whether the room got illuminated.\nPhoebe, in contrast, did make a difference to whether the\nroom got illuminated. It seems natural to say that, while\nPhoebe\u2019s turning on the power was a cause of the room being\nilluminated, Filipa\u2019s flipping the switch was not.\n\nSwitching cases have roughly the same structure as the following\nneuron diagram:\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Switch neuron diagram 1. [An\n extended description of figure 6\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nHere, the neuron s (the switch) is special. It can either be\nset to the left or to the right, indicated by the direction the arrow\nis pointing. Likewise, the connection between f and\ns is special. If f fires, then s will be\nset to the right. If f does not fire, then s will be\nset to the left. On the other hand, the connection between p\nand s is normal. If p fires, then s will\nfire. If s fires while set to the left, then l will\nfire. If s fires while set to the right, then r will\nfire. If either l or r fires, then e will\nfire.\n\nIf f hadn\u2019t fired, s would have fired while\nset to the left, so l would have fired, and e would\nhave fired.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Switch neuron diagram 2. [An\n extended description of figure 7\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nOn the other hand, if p hadn\u2019t fired, s would\nstill have been set to the right, but it would not have fired, so\nneither r nor e would have fired:\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Switch neuron diagram 3. [An\n extended description of figure 8\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nReflection on switches can lead to the conclusion that token causation\ncannot be merely a matter of the intrinsic nature of the process\nleading from cause to effect. Consider the following variant: while\nthe right bulb is functional, the left bulb is not. If the power had\nbeen turned on while the switch was set to the left, the left bulb\nwould not have turned on, and the room would have remained dark. Given\nthis setup, Filipa\u2019s flipping the switch to the right\ndoes appear to be a cause of the room\u2019s being\nilluminated. After all, with this setup, had Filipa not flipped the\nswitch, the room would have remained dark. But, if we just look at the\nintrinsic features of the process leading from Filipa\u2019s flipping\nthe switch to the room\u2019s illumination, there will be no\ndifference. Or consider the following system of neurons:\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Switch neuron diagram 4. [An\n extended description of figure 9\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nHere, f\u2019s firing appears to be a cause of\ne\u2019s firing (along with p). If f\nhadn\u2019t fired, then the switch s would have been set to\nthe left, so e would not have fired. So f\u2019s\nfiring was needed for e to fire. However, there doesn\u2019t\nseem to be any difference between the process leading from\nf\u2019s firing to e\u2019s firing in\nthis system of neurons and the process leading from\nf\u2019s firing to e\u2019s firing in the\noriginal system of neurons.\n\nSo switches suggest that whether one event (fact, or whatever),\nc, is a cause of another, e, is not just a matter of\nthe intrinsic features of the process leading from c to\ne. It looks like we may also have to consider counterfactual\ninformation about what things would have been like in the absence of\nc. (See the discussion in Paul and Hall, 2013.)\n\nSwitches also pose a problem for the view that causation is\ntransitive\u2014that is, the view that, if c causes\nd and d causes e, then c causes\ne. For, in the original version of the case, it seems that\nFilipa\u2019s flipping the switch to the right caused the right bulb\nto turn on. And it appears that the right bulb turning on caused the\nroom to be illuminated. But it does not appear that Filipa\u2019s\nflipping the switch to the right caused the room to be illuminated.\n(For further discussion of switches and the transitivity of causation,\nsee McDermott 1995; Hall 2000, 2007; Paul 2000; Hitchcock 2001a; Lewis\n2000; Maslen 2004; Schaffer 2005; Halpern 2016b; Beckers &\nVennekens 2017; and McDonnell 2018.)\n1.2.2 Arity\n\nThe standard view is that causation is a binary relation between two\nrelata: cause and effect. However, some suggest that causation may be\na ternary or a quaternary relation. Inspired by van Fraassen\n(1980)\u2019s work on contrastive explanation, we could take\ncausation to be a ternary, or 3-place, relation between a cause, an\neffect, and a contrast for the effect. On this view, the logical form\nof the causal relation is: c is a cause of e, rather\nthan e*. For instance, it seems correct to say that\nAdam\u2019s being hungry caused him to eat the apple, rather than\ntoss it aside. But it seems wrong to say that Adam\u2019s being\nhungry caused him to eat the apple, rather than the pear. So changing\nthe contrast for the effect seems to makes a difference to causation.\nHitchcock (1993, 1995a, 1996) gives a contrastive probabilistic theory\nof causation, according to which causation is a ternary relation\nbetween a cause, a contrast for the cause, and an effect. On this\nview, the logical form of the causal relation is: c, rather\nthan c*, is a cause of e. For instance, it can seem\nthat Paul\u2019s smoking a pack a day, rather than not at all, is a\ncause of his lung cancer. But it seems wrong that Paul\u2019s smoking\na pack a day, rather than two packs a day, is a cause of his lung\ncancer. Schaffer (2005) combines these two views, arguing that\ncausation is a quaternary relation between a cause, a contrast for the\ncause, an effect, and a contrast for the effect. On this view, the\nlogical form of the causal relation is: c, rather than\nc*, is a cause of e, rather than e*.\n\nIf we think that the causal relation is ternary or quaternary, then\nsome of the arguments we considered earlier can look weaker. For\ninstance, consider what we called the causal differences\nargument from\n \u00a71.1.4.\n We argued that we must distinguish the cause \u201cSusan\u2019s\nstealing the bike\u201d from \u201cSusan\u2019s\nstealing the bike\u201d, since the latter, but not the\nformer, caused her to be arrested. If we are contrastivists about\ncausation, then we could insist that the differences in focal stress\nserve to make salient different contrasts for one and the same event:\nSusan\u2019s stealing of the bike. When we emphasize \u201cthe\nbike\u201d, we suggests a contrast event in which Susan steals\nsomething else. And Susan\u2019s stealing the bike, rather than the\ncanoe, didn\u2019t cause her to be arrested. On the other hand, when\nwe emphasize \u201cstealing\u201d, we suggest a contrast event in\nwhich Susan does something else to the bike\u2014purchasing it,\nlet\u2019s say. And Susan\u2019s stealing the bike, rather than\npurchasing it, is a cause of her arrest. Schaffer (2005) even\nsuggests that, if causation is 4-place, then we could take the\nincredibly coarse-grained Quinean view of events.\n\nSchaffer (2005) additionally suggests that, if we say that causation\nis quaternary, we can defend a version of transitivity. Of course,\ntransitivity is a property of a binary relation, but Schaffer proposes\nthat the quaternary relation satisfies the following constraint: if\nc, rather than c*, is a cause of d, rather\nthan d*, and d, rather than d* is a cause\nof e, rather than e*, then c, rather than\nc* is a cause of e, rather than e*. Think\nof it like this: corresponding to the 4-place causal relation is a\ntwo-place relation between event-contrast pairs; and Schaffer\nmaintains that this two-place relation between pairs of events and\ntheir contrasts is a transitive relation. It\u2019s not immediately\nobvious how this helps with switches like the one we saw in\n \u00a71.2.1\n above. For it seems that Filipa\u2019s flipping the switch to the\nright, rather than not flipping it, caused the right bulb to be on,\nrather than off. And it seems that the right bulb being on, rather\nthan off, caused the room to be illuminated, rather than dark. But it\ndoesn\u2019t appear that Filipa\u2019s flipping the switch to the\nright, rather than not flipping it, caused the room to be illuminated,\nrather than dark. The trick is that Schaffer has a view of events on\nwhich they are world-bound. So, in order to make the first\ncausal claim true, the contrast \u201cthe right bulb\u2019s being\noff\u201d must be an event which only occurs in the world in which\nFilipa does not flip the switch to the right, and the left bulb is on.\nTherefore, the second causal claim will turn out to be false; the\nright bulb\u2019s being on, rather than off in a world in which\nthe left bulb is on, is not a cause of the room\u2019s being\nilluminated, rather than dark.\n1.2.3 Normality\n\nIt is natural to distinguish between causes and\nbackground, or enabling, conditions. For instance,\nsuppose that you strike a match and it lights. It\u2019s natural to\ncite your striking the match as a cause of its lighting, but\nit\u2019s far less natural to cite the presence of oxygen as a cause\nof its lighting, even though, without the oxygen, the match\nwouldn\u2019t have lit. There\u2019s some inclination to say that\nthe presence of oxygen merely enabled the strike to cause the\nmatch to light, but did not cause it to light itself. Lewis (1973)\nechoes a traditional, dismissive, attitude when he refers to the\ndistinction between causes and background conditions as\n\u201cinvidious discrimination\u201d (see also Mill 1843 and J. L.\nMackie 1974). On this view, the distinction is pragmatic,\nunsystematic, and dependent upon our interests. Alien scientists from\nVenus\u2014where there is no oxygen in the atmosphere\u2014might\nfind it incredibly natural to point to the presence of oxygen as a\ncause of the fire. On the traditional view, neither we nor the\nVenusian scientists are making any objective error; we each simply\nhave different expectations about the world, and so we find some\nfeatures of it more noteworthy than others. There are ever-so-many\ncauses out there, but we select some of them to call causes.\nThe others, the ones we do not select, are regarded as mere background\nconditions.\n\nHart and Honor\u00e9 (1959 [1985]) suggest that conditions which are\nnormal, or default, are background conditions;\nwhereas those which are abnormal, or deviant, are\ncauses. This distinction between normal, default, or inertial\nconditions and abnormal, deviant, or non-inertial causes has been\nappearing with increasing regularity in the recent literature. For\ninstance, McGrath (2005) presents the following vignette: Abigail goes\non vacation and asks her neighbor, Byron, to water her plant. Byron\npromises to water the plant, but doesn\u2019t, and the plant dies. It\nsounds very natural to say that Byron\u2019s failure to water the\nplant was a cause of its death; it sounds much worse to suggest that\nAbigail\u2019s other neighbor, Chris, caused the plant to\ndie by not watering it. However, it seems that the only relevant\ndifference between Bryon and Chris is that Byron made a\npromise to water the plant, and Chris did not. So\nByron\u2019s failure to water the plant was abnormal, whereas\nChris\u2019s failure to water the plant was normal. McGrath\u2019s\nexample involves absences or omissions, but this feature of the case\nis incidental. Hitchcock and Knobe (2009) give the following case:\nwhile administrators are allowed to take pens, professors are not.\nBoth Adriel the administrator and Piper the professor take pens. Later\nin the day, there are no pens left, and the Dean is unable to sign an\nimportant paper. Here, it seems much better to cite Piper than Adriel\nas a cause of the problem. And it seems that the only relevant\ndifference is that Adriel was permitted to take the pen, but\nPiper was not. (For more, see Kahneman & Miller 1986; Thomson\n2003; and Maudlin 2004.)\n\nConsidering just these kinds of cases, it\u2019s not unnatural to see\nthe phenomenon as just more \u201cselection effects\u201d. Perhaps\nboth Byron and Chris caused the plant to die, but for pragmatic\nreasons we find it more natural to cite the person who broke a promise\nas a cause. Hall (2007) presents a more challenging argument for the\nview that normality and defaults should figure in our theory of\ncausation. He asks us to consider the following pair of neuron\nsystems:\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFigure 10: Pair of neuron diagrams. [An\n extended description of figure 10\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nIn figure 10(a), we have the case of early preemption from\n \u00a71.2.1.\n Here, c\u2019s firing is a cause of e\u2019s\nfiring. In figure 10(b), we have a case of what Hall calls a\n\u201cshort circuit\u201d. When c fires, it both initiates\na threat to e\u2019s dormancy (by making a fire)\nand neutralizes that very threat (by making d fire).\nHere\u2019s a vignette with a similar structure (see Hall 2004, and\nHitchcock 2001a): a boulder becomes dislodged and careens down the\nhill towards Hiker. Seeing the boulder coming, Hiker jumps out of the\nway, narrowly averting death. In this case, the boulder\u2019s fall\nboth initiates a threat to Hiker\u2019s life and neutralizes that\nvery threat (by alerting them to its presence). Hall contends that the\nboulder\u2019s becoming dislodged did not cause Hiker to survive;\nand, in the case of the short circuit, c\u2019s firing did\nnot cause e to not fire. Intuitively, c accomplished\nnothing vis-a-vis e. But Hall notes that these two\nneuron systems are isomorphic to each other. We can make the point\nwith systems of structural equations (see the entry on\n causal models,\n and\n \u00a73.2\n below). Start with the case of early preemption, and use binary\nvariables, A, B, C, D, and\nE for whether a, b, c, d,\nand e fire, respectively. These variables takes on the value\n1 if their paired neuron fires, and they take on the value 0 if they\ndo not. Then, we can represent the causal structure of early\npreemption with this system of equations: \n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nA & \\coloneqq B \\wedge \\neg C \\\\\n D & \\coloneqq C\\\\\n E & \\coloneqq A \\vee D \\\\\n \n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nTurning to the short circuit, notice that we can use A*,\nB*, and E* as binary variables for whether the\nneurons a, b, and e do not fire.\nThese variables take on the values 1 if their paired neuron\ndoesn\u2019t fire, and they take on the value 0 if it\ndoes. And, again, we can use C and D as\nvariables for whether the neurons c and d fire;\nthese non-asterisked variables take on the value 1 if their paired\nneuron does fire, and 0 if it doesn\u2019t. With\nthese conventions in place, we can then write down the following\nisomorphic system of equations for the neuron system of short\ncircuit: \n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nA^{*} & \\coloneqq B^{*} \\wedge \\neg C \\\\\n D & \\coloneqq C \\\\\n E^{*} & \\coloneqq A^{*} \\vee D \n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nThese equations are isomorphic to the ones we wrote down for the case\nof early preemption. Moreover, the values of the variables are\nprecisely the same in each case. In the case of early preemption,\n\\(A=0\\) and \\(B = C = D = E = 1\\); whereas, in the case of short\ncircuit, \\(A^*=0\\) and \\(B^* = C = D = E^* = 1\\) (similar cases are\ndiscussed in Hiddleston 2005).\n\nTherefore, if we want to claim that c is a cause of\ne in the case of early preemption, but deny that c\nis a cause of e in the case of short circuit, we will have to\npoint to some information which is not contained in these equations\nand the values of these variables. And several authors have reached\nfor the distinction between default, normal states\nand deviant, abnormal events (see, for instance, Hall 2007;\nHitchcock 2007a; Halpern 2008, 2016a; Paul & Hall 2013; Halpern\n& Hitchcock 2015; and Gallow 2021. For criticism, see Blanchard\n& Schaffer, 2017).\n\nOn a traditional picture, there is a broad, indiscriminate notion of\ncausation which makes no appeal to normality; considerations of\nnormality are used, pragmatically, to \u201cselect\u201d which of\nthe indiscriminate causes we call \u201ccauses\u201d and which we\ncall \u201cbackground conditions\u201d. The isomorphism between\nearly preemption and short circuit challenges this picture, for two\nreasons. Firstly, c\u2019s firing is presumably just as\ndeviant in early preemption as it is in short circuit, so it\ncan\u2019t just be the normality of the putative cause which makes\nthe difference. Secondly, those who want to deny that\nc\u2019s firing is a cause of e\u2019s failure to\nfire in short circuit do not want to claim that c\u2019s\nfiring was even a background condition for e\u2019s failure\nto fire. The inclination is to say that c\u2019s firing had\nnothing at all to do with e\u2019s failure to\nfire.\n2. Type Causation\n2.1 Relationship to Token Causation\n\nType causal relations are described by generic claims like\n\u201cDrowsy driving causes crashes\u201d or \u201cSmoking causes\ncancer\u201d. One prominent question concerns the relationship\nbetween type and token causal claims. One view has it that type causal\nclaims are just generalizations or generics about token causal claims\n(see Lewis 1973; Hausman 1998: chapter 5; and Hausman 2005). For\ninstance, to say that smoking causes cancer is just to say that token\ncancers are generally caused by token histories of smoking. And to say\nthat drowsy driving causes crashes is just to say that, in general,\ntoken episodes of drowsy driving cause token crashes. Generic claims\nlike these shouldn\u2019t be understood as saying that most\nor even many token episodes of drowsy driving are token\ncauses of car crashes. Compare: \u201cmosquitos carry the West Nile\nvirus\u201d, which is a true generic despite the fact that most\nmosquitos do not carry the West Nile virus. (See the entry on\n generics.)\n On this view, type causal claims are ultimately about token causal\nrelations.\n\nAnother view has it that type causal relations are more fundamental\nthan token causal relations; what makes it the case that\nChris\u2019s smoking caused his cancer is, at least in part,\nthat smoking causes cancer, Chris smoked, and he got cancer. This kind\nof view is defended by theorists like Hume (1739\u201340, 1748), Mill\n(1843), J. L. Mackie (1965), Hempel (1965), and Davidson (1967). These\ntheorists begin by giving an analysis of causal relations between\ntypes of events, facts, or what-have-you. For instance: Hume says that\nwhat it is for the type C to cause the type E is for\nthings of type C to be constantly conjoined with things of\ntype E. This general regularity is then used to explain why\nit is that any particular thing of type C is a token cause of\nany particular thing of type E. Subsequent regularity and\n\u201ccovering law\u201d theories add additional bells and whistles;\nbut they retain the idea that a token causal relation between\nc and e holds in virtue of some broader regularity\nor law which subsumes the particular relationship between c\nand e.\n\nOne reason to doubt that token causal relations are just\ninstantiations of type causal relations is that there appear to be\ntoken causal relations without any corresponding type causal relation,\nand there appear to be token causal relations which go against the\ncorresponding type causal relations. Scriven (1962) gives the\nfollowing example: you reach for your cigarettes, accidentally\nknocking over an ink bottle and staining the carpet. Your reaching for\nyour cigarettes caused the carpet to be stained, but it\u2019s not\nthe case that reaching for cigarettes causes carpet stains in general.\nSuppes (1970) attributes this example to Deborah Rosen: at the golf\ncourse, you hit the ball into a tree, the ball rebounds and,\nfantastically enough, goes into the hole. In this case, hitting the\nball into the tree caused the hole-in-one, but hitting the ball into\ntrees does not cause holes-in-one in general.\n\nA third position, defended by Ellery Eells (1991), is that neither\ntoken nor type causal relations are more fundamental than the other.\nEells gives two probabilistic analyses of causation: one for type\ncausation, and another for token causation. Eells thinks that type\ncausal claims cannot just be generalizations about token causal claims\nbecause of examples like this: drinking a quart of plutonium causes\ndeath, even though nobody has ever drank a quart of plutonium, and so\nno particular persons\u2019s death has been caused by drinking a\nquart of plutonium. So this type causal claim cannot be a\ngeneralization over token causal claims. (See Hausman 1998: chapter 5,\nfor a response.)\n\nFor more on the relationship between token and type causation,\nparticularly within a probabilistic approach to causation, see\nHitchcock (1995a).\n2.2 Net and Component Effects\n\nConsider the following case, adopted from Hesslow (1976): suppose that\nbirth control pills (B) prevent pregnancy (P).\nHowever, they can also have the unintended side-effect of thrombosis\n(T). So we might be inclined to accept the type causal claim\n\u201cbirth control pills cause thrombosis\u201d. But wait:\nanother potential cause of thrombosis is pregnancy. And birth\ncontrol pills inhibit pregnancy. The general structure of the case is\nas shown below.\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Hesslow\u2019s birth control\ncase [An\n extended description of figure 11\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nBirth control pills directly promote thrombosis, but at the\nsame time, they prevent pregnancy, which itself promotes thrombosis.\nBy adjusting the probabilities, we can make it so that, overall,\ntaking birth control makes no difference to the probability of\nthrombosis. Then, we might be inclined to accept the type causal claim\n\u201cbirth control pills have no effect on\nthrombosis\u201d\u2014after all, your chances of getting thrombosis\nare exactly the same, whether or not you take birth control. Hitchcock\n(2001b) argues that cases like this require us to distinguish two\ndifferent kinds of effects which type causes can have: what he calls a\nnet effect, on the one hand, and what he calls component\neffect, on the other. In Hesslow\u2019s case, birth control\npills have no net effect on thrombosis. This is the sense in\nwhich it\u2019s true to say \u201cbirth control pills have no effect\non thrombosis\u201d. At the same time, birth control pills have a\ncomponent\u2014or path-specific\u2014effect on\nthrombosis. Along the path B \u2192 T, birth control\npromotes thrombosis. This is the sense in which it\u2019s true to say\n\u201cbirth control pills cause thrombosis\u201d. For further\ndiscussion, see Woodward (2003: \u00a72.3) and Weinberger (2019).\n3. Influence\n3.1 Relata\n\nAs emphasized in\n \u00a71.1\n above, any theory of events or facts can easily be transposed into a\ntheory of the values of token variables. And, plausibly, token\nvariables are individuated by their values. So, when it comes to token\ninfluence between variables, we will face many of the same questions\nand debates about the causal relata: how fine- or coarse-grained are\nthey? When are two variables the same; when are they different? Can\nvariables include absences or omissions as values? There is, however,\nan additional question to be a asked about the metaphysics of\nvariables: when can some collection of variable values be\ngrouped together into a single variable? All agree that the potential\nvalues of a variable must exclude each other. That is: if\n\\(v\\) and \\(v^*\\) are two values of the variable \\(V\\), then it should\nbe impossible that \\(V=v \\wedge V=v^*\\) (here, \\(V=v\\) is the\nproposition that the variable \\(V\\) takes on the value \\(v\\), and\nlikewise \\(V=v^*\\) is the proposition that the variable \\(V\\) takes on\nthe value \\(v^*\\)).\n\nBut there are additional questions to be asked about which values may\nbe grouped together into token variables. For instance: must the\nvalues of a variable concern the same time? Or can a single variable\nhave multiple values which concern different times? Suppose Patricia\ndied on Monday from an overdose of morphine; had she not received the\nmorphine, she would have died on Tuesday. Then, there are several\ndifferent variables we might try to use when thinking about\nPatricia\u2019s death. We could use a single variable for whether\nPatricia died. This variable would take on one value if Patricia\ndied on Monday or Tuesday, and another value if she remained alive\nthroughout Monday and Tuesday. Or we could use a single variable for\nwhen Patricia died. This variable would take on one value if\nshe died on Monday, and another value if she died on Tuesday.\nAlternatively, we could use a collection of time-indexed variables,\nwhether Patricia had died by time t, for some range\nof times t. As Hitchcock (2012) puts it: the question is\nwhether Patricia\u2019s dying on Monday and Patricia\u2019s dying on\nTuesday\n\n\ncorrespond to the same value of the same variable,\nto different values of the same variable, or to\nvalues of different variables. (2012: 90)\n\n\nOf course, this question carries the presupposition that we must\nchoose between these options. You might instead think that\nall of these variables exist, and each enter into different\nrelations of influence.\n\nWhen it comes to type variables, there are additional questions about\nhow token variables are to be type-individuated, over and above\nquestions about the individuation conditions of the token variables\nthemselves. This question is not much discussed, but it is natural to\nthink that the type individuation of variables is inherited from the\ntype-individuation of their values. That is: \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are\nof the same type if and only if \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) have the same\nnumber of potential values, and each those values are of the same\ntype. For instance, the token variables how much I weigh and\nhow much Obama weighs are of the same type, as they both have\nthe same type of potential values (1 kg, 2 kg, etc); on the other\nhand, how much I weigh and how many pounds of arugula\nObama eats are not of the same type, since their potential values\nare not of the same type.\n3.2 Models\n\nRelations of influence between variables are often encoded in formal\nmodels. Just as the causal relations between tokens and types can be\neither deterministic or probabilistic, so too can the relations of\ninfluence between variables be either deterministic or probabilistic.\nDeterministic relations between variables are represented with\nstructural equations models; whereas indeterministic relations between\nvariables can be represented with probabilistic models (sometimes with\nstructural equations models with random errors\u2014see the entry on\n causal models\u2014or\n often with just a causal graph paired with a probability distribution\nover the values of the variables appearing in that graph\u2014see the\nentry on\n probabilistic causation.)\n\nIn the deterministic case, the relations of influence between\nvariables can be encoded in a system of structural equations. For\nillustration, consider again the neuron system we used in\n \u00a71.2.1\n above to illustrate early preemption. As we saw in\n \u00a71.2.3,\n for each neuron in the system, we can introduce a variable for\nwhether that neuron fires at the relevant time. Once we\u2019ve done\nso, the following system of structural equations describes the causal\nrelations between these variables. \n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nA & \\coloneqq B \\wedge \\neg C \\\\\n D & \\coloneqq C \\\\\n E & \\coloneqq A \\vee D \n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nBefore getting to the metaphysical questions about what kinds of\nrelations these equations represent, and what it takes for a system of\nequations like this to be correct, let us first focus on how these\nequations are used in practice. It\u2019s important to\nrecognize that there is meant to be a difference between\nstructural equations and ordinary equations. The equation \\(D\n= C\\) is symmetric. It could be re-written, equivalently, as \\(C=D\\).\nIn contrast, the structural equation \\(D \\coloneqq C\\) is\nnonsymmetric. It tells us that the variable \\(D\\) is causally\ninfluenced by the variable \\(C\\). And this form of causal influence is\nnot symmetric. To emphasize that these equations are not symmetric,\n\u201c\\(\\coloneqq\\)\u201d is used, rather than\n\u201c\\(=\\)\u201d.\n\nSome terminology: given a system of structural equations, the\nvariables which appear on the left-hand-side of some equation are\ncalled the endogenous variables. The variables which only\never appear on the right-hand-side of the equations are called\nexogenous. The model does not tell us anything about how the\nvalues of the exogenous variables are determined; but it does tell us\nsomething about how the values of the endogenous variables are\ncausally determined by the values of the other variables in the\nmodel.\n\nIn this case, an assignment of values to the exogenous variables is\nenough to tell us the value of every endogenous variable in the model.\nThat is: if you know that \\(B=C=1\\), you also know that \\(A=0\\) and\n\\(D=E=1\\). That needn\u2019t be the case in general. For instance,\nconsider the following system of equations: \n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nY &\\coloneqq X + Z \\\\\n X &\\coloneqq Y - Z \n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nIn this system of structural equations, even after you know that the\nexogenous variable \\(Z = 10\\), you are not able to solve for the\nvalues of the two endogenous variables, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). The reason\nfor this is that, in this system of equations, there is a\ncycle of influence: \\(X\\) influences \\(Y\\), and \\(Y\\)\ninfluences \\(X\\). When there are cycles of influence like this, even a\ndeterministic system of equations, together with an assignment of\nvalues to the exogenous variables, will not determine the values of\nall of the endogenous variables. (See the entry on\n backwards causation\n and the section on causal loops in the entry on\n time travel.)\n However, if we rule out cycles of influence like this, then an\nassignment of values to the exogenous variables will determine the\nvalues of all of the variables in the model. Likewise, any probability\ndistribution over the exogenous variables will induce a probability\ndistribution over the endogenous variables, as well.\n\nIt is often assumed that each of the structural equations in the\nsystem is independently disruptable. For instance: there is, at least\nin principle, some way of disrupting \\(C\\)\u2019s causal influence on\n\\(D\\)\u2014some way of making it so that the structural equation \\(D\n\\coloneqq C\\) no longer holds\u2014which leaves it so that both of\nthe structural equations \\(A\\coloneqq B \\wedge \\neg C\\) and\n\\(E\\coloneqq A \\vee D\\) continue to hold. Not every way of disrupting\nthe causal relation between the variables \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) will be like\nthis. For instance, suppose that we remove all of the connections\nemanating out of the neuron c. This will disrupt the\ncausal connection between \\(C\\) and \\(D\\), but it will also disrupt\nthe causal connection between \\(C\\) and \\(A\\); it will make it so that\nthe structural equation \\(A\\coloneqq B \\wedge \\neg C\\) no longer\nholds. (This equation tells us that, if \\(C=1\\), then \\(A=0\\); but,\nwith the connection between c and a severed, this is\nno longer true.) This property of a system of structural\nequations\u2014that each of the equations may be disrupted without\naffecting any of the other equations in the model\u2014is known as\nmodularity. (For criticism of this requirement, see\nCartwright 2002; for a defense, see Hausman & Woodward 1999, 2004.\nFor more on modularity, see Woodward 2003.)\n\nIf the system of equations is modular, then it is at least in\nprinciple possible to disrupt one of the equations without affecting\nany of the others. Suppose that happens, and we disrupt the equation\n\\(A\\coloneqq B \\wedge \\neg C\\) without affecting any of the other\nequations, for instance. Suppose further that we do this in such a way\nas to determine the value of \\(A\\), or to determine a probability\ndistribution over the values of \\(A\\). Then, we have performed an\nintervention on the variable \\(A\\). Note that this notion of an\nintervention is relative to a system of equations. Whether some way of\ndisrupting an equation and directly setting the value of the variable\non its left-hand-side counts as an intervention or not will vary from\ncausal model to causal model. In general, an intervention on\nan endogenous variable, \\(V\\) (relative to some model) is some way of\nmaking it so that \\(V\\)\u2019s structural equation (the equation with\n\\(V\\) on the left-hand-side) no longer holds, even though every other\nstructural equation in the model continues to hold, and directly\nsetting the value of \\(V\\), or directly determining a probability\ndistribution over the values of \\(V\\).\n\nGiven a deterministic causal model\u2014a system of structural\nequations\u2014the way to formally represent an intervention on an\nendogenous variable, \\(V\\), is straightforward: you remove the\nstructural equation which has that variable on its left-hand-side, and\nleave all the other equations unchanged. You go on to treat \\(V\\) as\nif it were an exogenous variable, with the value or the probability\ndistribution it was given through the intervention. Assuming the\nsystem of equations is acyclic, you can then work out the value of the\nother variables in the model, or the probability distribution over the\nvalues of the other variables in the model, as before.\n\nInterventions like these have been used by many to provide a semantics\nfor what will here be called causal counterfactual\nconditionals. As the term is used here, what makes a counterfactual\ncausal is that it holds fixed factors which are causally\nindependent of its antecedent. It doesn\u2019t say anything about\nwhat would have to have been different in order for the\nantecedent to obtain. That is: it says nothing about the necessary\ncausal precursors of the antecedent. It holds fixed all factors which\nare not causally downstream of the antecedent, and only allows to\nswing free factors which are causally downstream of the antecedent.\nWithin a system of structural equations, this is accomplished by\nmodeling an intervention to bring about the truth of the\nantecedent. (For more on this \u201cinterventionist\u201d treatment\nof counterfactuals, see Galles & Pearl 1998; Briggs 2012; Huber\n2013, and the entry on\n counterfactuals.)\n3.3 Relationship to Token Causation\n\nSeveral authors have provided theories of token causation which use\ncausal models like these. (See, for instance, Hitchcock 2001a, 2007a;\nWoodward, 2003, Menzies 2004, 2006\n [Other Internet Resources];\n Halpern & Pearl 2005; Hall 2007; Halpern 2008, 2016a, 2016b;\nBeckers & Vennekens 2017, 2018; Andreas & G\u00fcnther 2020,\n2021; Gallow 2021; Weslake ms.\u2014see Other Internet Resources.)\nThe theories almost always understand the causal models as describing\nrelations of influence between token variables. Most of these\ntheories are roughly counterfactual. They attempt to use the\ninterventionist semantics for causal counterfactuals to provide an\naccount of when one variable value is a token cause of another. On\nthis approach, the networks of influence encoded in a causal model\nprovide the pathways along which token causation propagates. If one\nvariable value, \\(C=c\\), is going to be a token cause of another,\n\\(E=e\\), then there must be some path of influence leading from the\nvariable C to the variable E, \n\\[C \\to D_1 \\to D_2 \\to \\dots \\to D_N \\to E.\\]\n\n\nThe theories diverge in what additional conditions must be met for\n\\(C=c\\) to be a token cause of \\(E=e\\). Many, though not all, agree\nthat counterfactual dependence between \\(C=c\\) and \\(E=e\\) is\nsufficient for \\(C=c\\) being a token cause of \\(E=e\\). (For more, see\nthe entry on\n counterfactual theories of causation.)\n3.4 The Metaphysics of the Models\n\nThis section discusses what it takes for these models to be\naccurate\u2014what the world must be like to host the relations of\ninfluence described by the model. However, it must be noted that not\nevery author in the literature would be happy with the way this\nquestion is posed. Many prefer to talk about whether a model is\nappropriate or apt. This is in part because they\nrecognize that many of the models written down and used in practice\nmisrepresent the world. For instance, the models portray systems as\ndeterministic, neglecting minute quantum mechanical chances. Thus,\nHalpern writes that\n\n\nI am not sure that there are any \u201cright\u201d models, but some\nmodels may be more useful, or better representations of reality, than\nothers. (2016a: 108)\n\n\nOf course, if we are going to say that a causal model\nmisrepresents the world, we must have a prior understanding\nof what the model represents. To misrepresent is to represent\ninaccurately. This section is going to be focused on the question of\nwhat it is for a causal model to represent accurately. There is of\ncourse a further and subsequent question to be asked about when the\ninaccuracies of the model are negligible enough that the model may be\nappropriate or apt to use in a given context.\n\nIn one sense, this question should be seen as stipulative; the models\ncome from humans, not gods. It is for us to say what they do and do\nnot represent. Nonetheless, we should take care that our stipulations\ndon\u2019t undermine the purposes for which the models were designed,\nnor the use to which they are standardly put. Insofar as they are\nmeant to capture the notion of influence which appears in\ncausal claims like \u201chow much I water my plant influences how\ntall it grows\u201d, and insofar as they are meant to forge\nconnections between influence and counterfactuals\u2014or influence\nand and token causation, or influence and control, or influence and\nchance\u2014not just any stipulations will serve our purposes.\nWhether these connections are plausible or defensible will depend upon\nhow we understand the models; what we take them to be saying about the\nworld.\n\nThe formalism of the models is much the same, whether we are\nrepresenting token influence or type influence. But when it comes to\nexplaining what it takes for these models to be accurate, it will\nmatter whether we are talking about token influence or type influence.\nIn the case of token influence, Hitchcock (2001a: 283\u2013284)\nsuggests that what it takes for a causal model to be correct is for a\ncertain family of counterfactuals to be true:\n\n\nA system of structural equations is an elegant means for representing\na whole family of counterfactuals\u2026The correctness of a set of\nstructural equations\u2026depends upon the truth of these\ncounterfactuals.\n\n\nOn this kind of view, what it takes for a system of structural\nequations to correctly represent a network of token influence is for\nsome corresponding counterfactuals to be true. There is a weaker and a\nstronger version of this requirement. On the stronger version, we\nrequire that all of the (infinitely many) counterfactuals\nwhich can be derived from the model (via the interventionist\nprocedure outlined in the previous subsection) are true. On the weaker\nversion, we require only the more limited class of counterfactuals\nwhich say that, were any subset of the variables to have their values\nset via an intervention, the equations for the non-intervened\nupon variables would continue to be true. For illustration, take the\nfollowing system of equations, \n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nZ &\\coloneqq X + Y \\\\\n Y &\\coloneqq X \n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nThe weak requirement is that, for any values \\(x, y, z\\), the\nfollowing counterfactuals hold: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{1} X = x &{}\\boxto ( Y=x \\wedge Z= x + Y) \\\\\n Y = y &{}\\boxto Z = X + y \\\\\n Z = z &{}\\boxto Y = X \\\\\n (X=x \\wedge Y=y) &{}\\boxto Z= x + y \\\\\n (X=x \\wedge Z=z) &{}\\boxto Y = x \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nOne worry with the weak requirement is that the counterfactuals in (1)\nfail to capture the modularity of the structural equations. Recall:\nit\u2019s important to distinguish between the structural\nequations \\(Y \\coloneqq X\\) and \\(Z \\coloneqq X + Y\\) and the\nequations \\(Y = X\\) and \\(Z=X+Y\\). Modularity is not just the\nclaim that, if we were to intervene to set X equal to\nx, the equations \\(Y = X\\) and \\(Z=X+Y\\) would continue to be\ntrue. It is the claim that, if we were to intervene to set X\nequal to x, the structural equations \\(Y \\coloneqq\nX\\) and \\(Z \\coloneqq X + Y\\) would continue to hold. This\nrequires, at least, that the counterfactuals \n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nX=x' &{}\\boxto Y=x' \\\\\n (X=x' \\wedge Y=y) &{}\\boxto Z = x' + y \n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nwould still be true, for any values \\(x'\\) and \\(y\\), were we\nto intervene to set X equal to x. So it requires\nthat the nested counterfactuals \n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nX=x & {}\\boxto (X=x' \\boxto Y=x') \\\\\n X = x &{}\\boxto ((Y=y \\wedge X=x') \\boxto Z= x' + y) \n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nare actually true. (And, indeed, these nested counterfactuals follow\nfrom the system of equations, on the causal modeling semantics.)\nHowever, on many semantics for counterfactuals, this nested\ncounterfactual does not follow from the counterfactuals given in\n(3.4.1) above. We might attempt to reduce nested counterfactuals like\nthese to counterfactuals with conjunctive antecedents by appeal to a\nprinciple of exportation, according to which \\(\\phi \\boxto (\\psi\n\\boxto \\chi)\\) follows from \\((\\phi \\wedge \\psi) \\boxto \\chi\\).\nHowever, on the causal modeling semantics, exportation is not valid in\ngeneral. Take the causal model above. Assuming counterfactuals with\nnecessarily false antecedents are vacuously true, \n\\[(X=x \\wedge X = x') \\boxto Y = x \\]\n\n\nwill be deemed true so long as \\(x \\neq x'\\). But \n\\[X = x {}\\boxto (X=x' \\boxto Y = x) \\]\n\n\nwill be deemed false. (See Briggs 2012, for related discussion, and\nGallow 2016, for an alternative approach.)\n\nSome think that more than a family of true counterfactuals is required\nin order for a token causal model to be correct\u2014or, at least, in\norder for a causal model to provide us with a guide to token causation\n(see\n \u00a73.3).\n Many, persuaded by the considerations from\n \u00a71.2.3\n above, include information about which variable values are more or\nless normal than which others. And Handfield et al. (2008) suggest\nthat the models must only represent relations of influence which\ncorrespond to \u201cconnecting processes\u201d, in the sense of Fair\n(1979), Salmon (1984, 1994), or Dowe (2000). The idea is this: if a\nvariable, X, shows up on the right-hand-side of\nY\u2019s structural equation, then there must be some\npossible state of the system (some possible assignment of values to\nthe variables in the model) such that, in that state, there is a\nconnecting process leading from X\u2019s value to\nY\u2019s value.\n\nWoodward (2003) focuses on systems of type influence. He\nproposes a series of non-reductive definitions which jointly\ncharacterize what it is for one type of variable, X, to\ndirectly influence another type of variable, Y, relative to a\nset of variables types, \\(\\mathbf{V}\\), which contains both X\nand Y. First, we are told:\n\n\nX directly influences Y, relative to a set of\nvariables \\(\\mathbf{V}\\), iff there is a possible intervention on\nX which will change Y when all other variables in\n\\(\\mathbf{V}\\) are held fixed at some value by interventions.\n\n\nThe definition makes reference to the notion of an\nintervention. (Notice: though Woodward is explicating the\nrelation of type influence, any particular intervention will\nbe a token occurrence.) We saw how interventions are formally\nmodeled in the previous subsection; but Woodward gives the following\ndefinition of an intervention in terms of an intervention\nvariable. We are told:\n\n\nI\u2019s assuming some value I=i is an intervention\non X (with respect to Y) iff I is an\nintervention variable for X (with respect to Y) and\nI=i is a token cause of the value taken on by X.\n\n\nThis definition relies upon the notion of an intervention\nvariable (for X with respect to Y). We are\ntold:\n\n\nI is an intervention variable for X with respect to\nY, relative to \\(\\mathbf{V}\\), iff:\n\nI influences X;\nthere are values of I such that, when I takes on\nthose values, X\u2019s value does not change when any of the\nother variables in \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) which influence X change\ntheir values; instead, the value of X is determined by the\nvalue of I alone;\nevery directed path of influence leading from I to\nY travels through X\u2014that is, if there\u2019s\nsome collection of variables \\(Z_1, Z_2, \\dots, Z_N \\in \\mathbf{V}\\)\nsuch that \\(I\\) directly influences \\(Z_1\\), \\(Z_1\\) directly\ninfluences \\(Z_2\\), \\(\\dots\\), and \\(Z_N \\) directly influences \\(Y\\),\nthen \\(X = Z_i\\), for some \\(i \\in \\{ 1, 2, \\dots, N \\}\\)\nI is statistically independent of any variable Z\nwhich directly influences Y and which is on a directed path\nof influence which does not go through X.\n\n\n\nThis definition appeals to the notion of (type) influence; so it will\nnot allow us to gives a reductive analysis of influence. But notice\nthat it doesn\u2019t appeal to influence between X and\nY\u2014and that is the relation which Woodward is attempting\nto characterize. So while the series of definitions are not reductive,\nthey are not viciously circular. They tell us something about\nhow influence between X and Y relates to influence\nbetween variables besides X and Y. (See the entry on\n causation and manipulability\n for more.)",
