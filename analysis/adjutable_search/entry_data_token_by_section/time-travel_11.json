    "main_text": "Time and Change || Time Travel and Time\n4.1 Time Travel and Time\nG\u00f6del (1949a [1990b]) argues from the possibility of time\ntravel (more precisely, from the existence of solutions to the field\nequations of General Relativity in which there exist CTC\u2019s) to\nthe B-theory: that is, to the conclusion that there is no objective\nflow or passage of time and no objective now. G\u00f6del begins by\nreviewing an argument from Special Relativity to the B-theory: because\nthe notion of simultaneity becomes a relative one in Special\nRelativity, there is no room for the idea of an objective succession\nof \u201cnows\u201d. He then notes that this argument is disrupted\nin the context of General Relativity, because in models of the latter\ntheory to date, the presence of matter does allow recovery of an\nobjectively distinguished series of \u201cnows\u201d. G\u00f6del\nthen proposes a new model (G\u00f6del 1949 [1990a]) in which no such\nrecovery is possible. (This is the model that contains CTC\u2019s.)\nFinally, he addresses the issue of how one can infer anything about\nthe nonexistence of an objective flow of time in our universe\nfrom the existence of a merely possible universe in which\nthere is no objectively distinguished series of\n\u201cnows\u201d. His main response is that while it would not be\nstraightforwardly contradictory to suppose that the existence of an\nobjective flow of time depends on the particular, contingent\narrangement and motion of matter in the world, this would nevertheless\nbe unsatisfactory. Responses to G\u00f6del have been of two main\nkinds. Some have objected to the claim that there is no objective flow\nof time in his model universe (e.g. Savitt (2005); see also Savitt\n(1994)). Others have objected to the attempt to transfer conclusions\nabout that model universe to our own universe (e.g. Earman (1995,\n197\u2013200); for a partial response to Earman see Belot (2005,\n\u00a73.4)).[28]\n\n\nEarlier we posed two questions:\n\nAre the past, present and future equally real? \nIs there an objective flow or passage of time, and an objective now?\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s argument is related to the second\nquestion. Let\u2019s turn now to the first question. Godfrey-Smith\n(1980, 72) writes \u201cThe metaphysical picture which underlies time\ntravel talk is that of the block universe [i.e. eternalism, in the\nterminology of the present entry], in which the world is conceived as\nextended in time as it is in space.\u201d In his report on\nthe Analysis problem to which Godfrey-Smith\u2019s paper is\na response, Harrison (1980, 67) replies that he would like an argument\nin support of this assertion. Here is an\nargument:[29]\n A fundamental requirement for the possibility of time\ntravel is the existence of the destination of the journey. That is, a\njourney into the past or the future would have to presuppose that the\npast or future were somehow real. (Grey, 1999, 56)\n\nDowe (2000, 442\u20135) responds that the destination does not\nhave to exist at the time of departure: it only has to exist at the\ntime of arrival\u2014and this is quite compatible with non-eternalist\nviews. And Keller and Nelson (2001, 338) argue that time travel is\ncompatible with presentism:\n There is four-dimensional [i.e. eternalist, in the\nterminology of the present entry] time-travel if the appropriate sorts\nof events occur at the appropriate sorts of times; events like people\nhopping into time-machines and disappearing, people reappearing with\nthe right sorts of memories, and so on. But the presentist can have\njust the same patterns of events happening at just the same times. Or\nat least, it can be the case on the presentist model that the right\nsorts of events will happen, or did happen, or are happening, at the\nrights sorts of times. If it suffices for four-dimensionalist\ntime-travel that Jennifer disappears in 2054 and appears in 1985 with\nthe right sorts of memories, then why shouldn\u2019t it suffice for\npresentist time-travel that Jennifer will disappear in 2054, and that\nshe did appear in 1985 with the right sorts of memories?\n\nSider (2005) responds that there is still a problem reconciling\npresentism with time travel conceived in Lewis\u2019s way: that\nconception of time travel requires that personal time is similar to\nexternal time\u2014but presentists have trouble allowing\nthis. Further contributions to the debate whether presentism\u2014and\nother versions of the A-theory\u2014are compatible with time travel\ninclude Monton (2003), Daniels (2012) and Hall (2014) on the side of compatibility,\nand Miller (2005), Slater (2005), Miller (2008) and Hales (2010) on\nthe side of incompatibility.\n",
