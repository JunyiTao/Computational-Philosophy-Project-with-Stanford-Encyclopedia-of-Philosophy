    "main_text": "Mental imagery in cognition || Mental imagery and knowledge\n3.4 Mental imagery and knowledge\n\nPerception sometimes justifies our beliefs. If you see that it is\nraining outside, this may justify your belief that it is raining\noutside. And much of what we know is based on perception. But how\nabout mental imagery? Can mental imagery justify our beliefs? There\nare two related, but independent questions here. The first one is\nabout whether mental imagery could ever be a source of knowledge or\neven new information. And the second one is about reliability: if\nperception is colored by mental imagery, should this give us a more\ncomplex picture of perceptual justification?\n\nThe first of these questions is about whether mental imagery itself\n(that is not in conjunction with perception) can lead to knowledge or\neven to new information. Jean-Paul Sartre, for example, famously\nclaimed that \u201cnothing can be learned from an image that is not\nalready known.\u201d (Sartre 1948, 12) Since on his view \u201cit is\nimpossible to find in the image anything more than what was put into\nit,\u201d we can conclude that \u201cthe image teaches\nnothing.\u201d (Sartre 1948, 146\u20137). Sartre was not always\nmaking a clear distinction between imagination and mental imagery, so\nit is not clear whether it is imagination or mental imagery that\nteaches nothing. Contemporary philosophers tend to raise this issue\nabout imagination (Langland-Hassan 2016, 2020, see also Kind and Kung\n2016), but the question from our point of view is whether it is true\nof mental imagery. And here some examples seem to suggest that even if\nimagination teaches nothing, mental imagery can and does. When you\nwant to wrap a chocolate box in wrapping paper, you look at it and\nform (often involuntarily, not by counting to three and voluntarily\nimagining) visual imagery of the wrapping paper needed and you may\nfind your estimation of the size of the paper unexpected or\nsurprising. Maybe it\u2019s larger than you had assumed. Or smaller.\nYour estimation of the size of the paper needed can be very different\nbefore and after forming the mental imagery of the paper covering the\nchocolate box (and this can, of course, be still different from the\nsize of the paper actually needed, see Gauker forthcoming for more\nexamples of this kind). If we can generalize from this example (see\nLevin 2006 for discussion), then mental imagery can lead to new\ninformation even if imagination cannot.\n\nThe second question is about the reliability of perceptual\njustification. If (see Section 2 above), perception per se is a hybrid\nbetween sensory stimulation-driven perception and mental imagery, what\ndoes this mean for the concept of perceptual justification? Even if\nsensory stimulation-driven perception can justify beliefs, if mental\nimagery does not, then the hybrid state of the two, that is,\nperception per se, may not be as epistemically innocent as it has been\nthought (MacPherson 2012). Mental imagery is defined precisely by the\nlack of direct causal link with the sensory input. In any kind of\nbroadly externalist account of justification, this raises worries\nabout the epistemic work that mental imagery can do (as the\nreliability of mental imagery is supposed to depend on the directness\nof the causal link between mental imagery and what the mental imagery\nis about). This does not mean that mental imagery does no epistemic\nwork as the lack of a direct causal link would be compatible with the\nmental imagery nonetheless carrying information about the external\nworld reliably \u2013 and, arguably, this is exactly what happens in\nthe case of amodal completion (Helton and Nanay 2019). But if we take\nthe importance of mental imagery in perception seriously, we need to\nexamine the reliability of these non-direct causal links of mental\nimagery.\n",
