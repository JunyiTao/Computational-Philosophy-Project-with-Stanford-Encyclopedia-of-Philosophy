    "main_text": "Partiality and Impartiality || The Partialist-Impartialist Debate\n7. Epistemic partiality and impartiality\n\nCommonsense morality agrees with most deontological theories that\npersonal relationships involve various forms of morally admirable\npartiality. Until now most philosophers who have examined this\nphenomenon have focused on practical obligations: the ways in which we\nare obligated to treat our friends and relatives better than we treat\npeople whom we do not know and to whom we are not significantly\nrelated. Disagreements regarding the extent and nature of such\npractical obligations have dominated the partialist-impartialist\ndebate.\n\nRecently, however, a number of philosophers have focused their\nattention on a second sort of obligation we seem to have to friends\nand relatives. In addition to treating them differently, commonsense\nthought seems to hold that we ought to adopt different patterns of\nbelief formation and evaluation with respect to them \u2013 patterns\nof belief formation and evaluation that make it more likely that we\nwill think highly of them and regard them in a positive light. Thus,\nit has been suggested that friendship and similar relationships\ninvolve epistemic partiality: there are forms of epistemic bias which\nare recommended and possibly required by such relationships. As Simon\nKeller has written, \u201cwhen good friends form beliefs about each\nother, they sometimes respond to considerations that have to do with\nthe needs and interests of their friends, not with aiming at the\ntruth, and that this is part of what makes them good friends\u201d\n(Keller 2004, 333).\n\nSimilarly, Sarah Stroud has argued that when it is a friend\u2019s\nbehavior that is in question, rather than that of a stranger,\n\u201cwe tend to devote more energy to defeating or minimizing the\nimpact of unfavorable data than we otherwise would. \u2026 [A]t the\nend of the day we are simply less likely to conclude that our friend\nacted disreputably, or that he is a bad person, than we would in the\ncase of a nonfriend\u201d (Stroud 2006, 505\u20136).\n\nAs both Keller and Stroud point out, these are not simply descriptions\nof typical friendship behavior; rather, they seem to be generally\naccepted as requirements of friendship. If so \u2013 and if it really\nis true that epistemic partiality makes us less likely to form true\nbeliefs (but see Jollimore 2011 for a challenge to this claim) \u2013\nthen we seem to face a difficult choice: we must either accept that\nforming true beliefs is not the only goal with respect to which\nepistemic standards should be evaluated, or else accept that the\nrequirements of friendship and other forms of love can conflict with\nthe requirements of epistemic rationality: being an ideal epistemic\nagent, that is, is not always compatible with being an ideal\nfriend.\n\nAs always, the issue is complicated by the effects of context. Whether\nthey are motivational or epistemic (or some combination of the two),\npartial biases that are entirely appropriate in some contexts, such as\nfriendship, will be deeply inappropriate in others, such as the making\nof hiring or sentencing decisions. (This assumes, of course, that we\nare rejecting the consequentialist view that the requirements of\nstrict impartiality are pervasive in all aspects of our lives.) As\nmentioned above, empirical research on implicit bias strongly suggests\nthat even when we recognize that we are acting in the latter sort of\ncontext, and believe ourselves to be acting in a thoroughly impartial\nand unbiased manner, we may well be fooling ourselves. Thus,\nformulating a correct theoretical understanding of the scope and\ndemands of partiality and impartiality, as difficult as that task is\nin itself, may not be sufficient for acting as a truly good or\nvirtuous agent. The more practical task of training our perceptions,\ninclinations, and motivations in order to see and respond to the\nworld, at least where appropriate, in an impartial way \u2013 or, if\nthis is not possible, then to see and act in ways that take into\naccount and correct for our inherent biases \u2013 would also seem to\nbe necessary.\n",
