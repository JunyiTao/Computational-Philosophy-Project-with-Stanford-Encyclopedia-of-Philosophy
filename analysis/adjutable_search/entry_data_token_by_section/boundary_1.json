    "main_text": "Issues || Owned vs. Unowned Boundaries\n1.1 Owned vs. Unowned Boundaries\n\nThe first sort of puzzle relates to the intuition that a boundary\nseparates two entities, or two parts of the same entity,\nwhich are then said to be in contact with each other.\nFollowing Smith (1997a: 534), imagine ourselves traveling from\nMaryland to Pennsylvania. What happens as we cross the Mason-Dixon\nline? Do we pass through a last point p in Maryland and a\nfirst point q in Pennsylvania? Clearly not, given the density\nof the continuum. As Aristotle put it, no two points can lie \u201cin\nsuccession\u201d to each other (Physics, VI, 231b6\u20139),\nso we should have to countenance an infinite number of further points\nbetween p and q, hence between the two States,\ncontrary to their being in contact. But, equally clearly, we can\nhardly acknowledge the existence of just one of p and\nq, as is dictated by the standard mathematical treatment of\nthe continuum (Dedekind 1872); either choice would amount to a\npeculiar privileging of one State over the other, an unacceptably\narbitrary asymmetry. And it would seem that we cannot identify\np with q, either, for we are speaking of two\nadjacent States; their territories cannot have any parts in\ncommon, not even pointy parts. So, where is the Mason-Dixon\nline, and how does it relate to the two adjacent entities it\nseparates?\n\nThe puzzle can be generalized. Consider the dilemma raised by Leonardo\nda Vinci in his Notebooks (1938: 75\u201376): What is it\nthat divides the atmosphere from the water? Is it air or is it water?\nOr consider Su\u00e1rez\u2019s worry in the Disputations\n(40, V, \u00a758), repeatedly echoed by Peirce (1892: 546; 1893:\n7.127): What color is the line of demarcation between a black spot and\nits white background? Perhaps figure/ground considerations could be\ninvoked to provide an answer in this second case, based on the\nprinciple that the boundary is always owned by the figure \u2014 the\nbackground is topologically \u201copen\u201d (Jackendoff 1987, App.\nB). But what is figure and what is ground when it comes to two\nadjacent halves of the same black spot? What is figure and what is\nground when it comes to Maryland and Pennsylvania? What happens when a\nseabird dives into the water? Indeed, it would be natural to suppose\nthat all entities of the same sort behave alike \u2014 for instance,\nthat all material bodies be figure-like entities, each possessing its\nown boundary. But then, how could any two of them ever be or\ncome in contact, short of penetrability? (In this last form,\nthe question goes back to Sextus Empiricus, Against the\nPhysicists, I, 258\u2013266, and is widely discussed in recent\nliterature; see e.g. Kline and Matheson 1987, Godfrey 1990, Hazen\n1990, Zimmerman 1996b, Lange 2002, \u00a71.3, Hudson 2005, \u00a73.1,\nKilborn 2007, Sherry 2015.)\n\nConsider also Plato\u2019s classical version of the puzzle in regard\nto temporal boundaries (Parmenides, 156c\u2013e): When an\nobject starts moving, or a moving object comes to rest, is it in\nmotion or is it at rest? As Aristotle later put it, the question\narises precisely because \u201cthe now that is the extremity of both\ntimes must be one and the same\u201d, for again, \u201cif each\nextremity were different, the one could not be in succession to the\nother\u201d (Physics, VI, 234a5\u20136). Of course, one\ncould maintain that there is no motion at an instant, but\nonly during an interval, as Aristotle himself held\n(231b18\u2013232a18, 234a24\u2013b9). Yet the question remains: Does\nthe transitional moment belong to the motion interval or to the rest\ninterval? (On this version of the puzzle, see Medlin 1963, Hamblin\n1969, Strang 1974, Kretzmann 1976, Sorabji and Kretzmann 1976, Sorabji\n1983, ch. 26, Mortensen 1985.)\n\nBesides, the problem is not specific to the transition between motion\nand rest and admits of several variants that would seem to resist\nAristotle\u2019s solution. Gellius, for instance, tells us that the\nMiddle Platonists were much concerned with the parallel question of\nwhether a dying person dies when they are already in the grasp of\ndeath or while they still live (Noctes Atticae, VI, xiii,\n5\u20136). This was thought to be a genuine insolubilis,\nshort of conceding the absurdity that no one ever dies (Sextus\nEmpiricus, Against the Physicists, I, 269), and the same\ncould be said of the many variants discussed by later Platonists and\nby medieval and modern philosophers (see Strobach 1998 and Goubier and\nRoques 2018). Deep down, the puzzle is no less than a primary\nillustration of the paradoxical nature of instantaneous change (about\nwhich see the entry on\n change and inconsistency).\n",
