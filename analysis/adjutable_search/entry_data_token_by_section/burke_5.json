    "main_text": "Burke\u2019s practical reasoning\n6. Burke\u2019s practical reasoning\n\n\nLet us turn to how Burke\u2019s thinking was informed by his philosophical thinking, especially to his use of relation. Burke\u2019s method for written composition often combined (i)\nidentification of relations, with (ii) relevant history, and (iii)\ntreatment in language that would attach pro-attitudes to one side or\nthe other in a difference of opinion. This method is seen, for\ninstance, in his Thoughts on the Cause of the Present\nDiscontents (1770). Its central statement for our purpose is\nabout (i) relation in the form of connexion: that the British\nconstitution had been constructed in a manner that required the\nconnexion (in this case the interdependence) of the parts of the\nsovereign in order to achieve mutual control. This statement\ncontrasted with (ii) the historical statement that there was a new\nsystem of court politics which involved disconnecting those parts in\norder to make the monarch independent of the other parts of the\npolitical sovereign. Burke\u2019s history showed the emergence of this new\nsystem, and illustrated its pernicious results in both domestic and\nforeign affairs. The contrast (iii) between the older system \u2014\nwhich was represented as having benign results\u2014was clear, and\nthe disposition of pro-language obvious enough. Burke\u2019s appeal lay to\nthe standards which his contemporaries would take for granted, namely\nthose implied in their beliefs about parliamentary sovereignty. As if\nit were not enough, the picture of the older order was reinforced by a\nsense of connexion in the Aristotelian sense that Burke\u2019s society\nrecognized and approved\u2014that man was sociable, rather than\nbeing a solitary beast, and above all by the annexation of the key\nterm of\nconnexion to the side of the dispute that Burke favoured. All\nof these considerations suggested the appropriateness of \u2018the\ngood\u2019 combining to counterbalance the efforts of court\npoliticians, and so to sustain parliamentary sovereignty and its\nbenefits.\n\n\nThis illustrates Burke\u2019s remarkable ability to combine philosophical\nmethod and philosophical history, as well as the practical purpose to\nwhich he put them\u2014forming an understanding of politics which\nwas practical in the very particular sense of calling for activity in\none direction to counterbalance forces coming from another. It was\nalso practical in relation to advancing very specific interests. These\nconsiderations were used to situate quite another sense of connexion,\nnamely political party, and especially the party of Lord Rockingham to\nwhich and to whom Burke had attached himself. Indeed Present\nDiscontents was read in draft by his party\u2019s leading lights before\npublication. On publication, the pamphlet was widely understood as a\nmanifesto for this party. After publication Present\nDiscontents became a manual from which fledging politicians\nlearnt the rationale of their party, and, indeed, a source book for\ncat calls from the party colleagues from whom Burke separated\nin 1791. The philosophical and historical element in Burke\u2019s positions\nis evident only to those who retrace all of his steps; an activity\nwhich his contemporaries lacked the will, and (as not all of his major\nworks had been published) some of the means to do.\n\n\nThe educative effect of Burke\u2019s writing is not to be underestimated\nin a civil society, which boasted many highly literate members but had very few with any\nformal education in political science (except, sometimes, at\nScottish universities). Indeed, it is likely that Burke wrote in order\nto educate. Yet at the same time that the strength of his conceptual\nand historical arguments, and the skill with which he developed these,\nexcites the reader\u2019s admiration, they create unease. This is not merely\nbecause in Present Discontents the philosophical sense of\nconnexion is used to adumbrate the claims of a party connexion: it is a\nmore generalized disquiet. A politician inspires confidence, in part,\nbecause s/he is honest: and a good way to be thought honest is to\nconvey the impression that you are not clever enough to deceive. As a\nphilosopher commands interest when s/he is intellectually powerful,\nthis impression is one that is naturally hard to achieve: but it can be\ndone. C.D. Broad suggested that \u2018Locke, we feel, is not so much\ncleverer than ourselves as to be capable of playing tricks with us even\nif he wanted to do so. He is the Mr Baldwin\n [6]\n of philosophy, and he derives from his literary style some of the\nadvantages which that statesman owed to his pipe and his pigs.\u2019\n(Broad 1952, 39). This judgement does not apply to Burke, even though\nhe did keep pigs. The reader carries away from Burke a sense of great\ncreative power, dialectical skill, and verbal ingenuity: in short, a\nsense of being overborne by intellectual force. The listener probably\nreceived other and unwelcome sensations when these were seconded by\npersonal raucousness. Such feelings generate unease, and unease is\nincreased by Burke\u2019s prose.\n\n\nHis literary style is to argue clearly, but in doing so to include a\nmanifest carefulness of qualification that will permit subsequent\nshifts of position\u2014for instance his self-description as a\n\u2018true but severe friend to monarchy\u2019 is consistent with\nhis occupying any point within the generous spectrum of parliamentary\nsovereignty\u2014and, indeed, the sense of historical change which\npervades Present Discontents suggests that movement is a\ncommon experience. Unease, perhaps, is increased even further: for\nagainst one equipped with this intellectual repertoire, the accusation\nof inconsistency is irresistibly tempting and utterly useless. Again,\nBurke\u2019s is a very sensible way for a statesman to think, but it is not\nhow the public wishes politicians to appear on most occasions. Still\nless is it reassuring about Burke\u2019s intellectual bona fides:\nfor this is not how people innocent of political experience, who are\nthe majority, conceive the role of political principles. Coleridge put\nhis finger on an important point when he suggested that from\n\u2018principles exactly the same\u2019 Burke could draw\n\u2018practical inferences almost opposite\u2019 in different\nsituations (Coleridge, Biographica Literaria, vol. i,\n191). Burke\u2019s philosophical and historical positions are clear, but\nthey do not translate, and were not meant to translate, into a set of\nspecific practical conclusions of permanent validity.\n\n\nThere was the contrast, too, between the breadth of view and of\nlearning in the matured statements that Burke published, on the one\nhand, and, on the other, the ways of the parliamentary pugilist who\nwas audible to fellow M.P.s and legible to others in the speeches\nreported by the daily newspapers. Burke\u2019s manner was anything but\n\u2018philosophical\u2019 as the public understands the word. Partly\nthis was, doubtless, because Burke was like that as a person, and not\nleast because he had a weak voice that had to be raised if it was to\nbe heard in the bear garden that was the House of Commons, but partly,\ntoo, because his Philosophical Enquiry had suggested that the\nbest way to impart a mood to an audience was to display it\noneself. So, for instance, if Burke needed to plead for moderation, he\ndid so immoderately. Above all, perhaps, it was because this\nphilosopher- turned-participant was not exempt from the need to win to\nhis side enough minds to ensure that his side was not beaten (or, at\nany rate, demonstrated enough strength to remain in contention), and\nhad at hand an exceptionally powerful range of persuasive tools. It is\nan evident fact, too, that the resources of Western civilization were\nsometimes invoked by Burke in order to produce votes in the House of\nCommons\u2014votes, which, whatever else they were, were in the\ninterests of his party. But, manifestly, these resources do not supply\na rationale for only one policy, still less for only one party. The\nroles of thinker and party spokesman consort ill: and there were bound\nto be doubts about one\nWho born for the Universe, narrow\u2019d his mind,\n\n And to party gave up, what was meant for mankind.\n\n Tho\u2019 fraught with all learning, kept straining his throat,\n\n To persuade Tommy Townshend to lend him a vote.\n\n (Goldsmith, lines 31\u201334).\n\n\nAn apparent disruption of this sort was always likely to suggest that Burke had\nprofoundly personal motives for narrowing his mind, and when he was\nnot being caricatured as an Irish Jesuit he was being satirized as a\ncorrupt hack\n [7].\n Yet some sort of procedure of the type pursued by Burke was implied\nin his sense of practical reasoning. The \u2018philosopher in\naction\u2019 had the function of finding \u2018proper means\u2019\nto \u2018the proper ends of Government\u2019 marked out by\n\u2018the speculative philosopher\u2019 (TCD, W & S, 1981\u20132015,\nii. 45\u201351). Parliamentary votes, in the situation that Burke found\nhimself, were amongst the proper means.\n",
