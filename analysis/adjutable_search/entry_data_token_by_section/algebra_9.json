    "main_text": "Abstract Algebra || Applications\n2.5 Applications\n\nWhy study entire classes? Well, consider for example the set \\(Z\\) of\nintegers along with the binary operation of addition \\(x+y\\), the\nunary operation of negation \\(-x\\), and the constant 0. These\noperations and the constant satisfy various laws such as \\(x+(y+z) =\n(x+y)+z, x+y = y+x, x+0 = x\\), and \\(x+(-x) = 0\\). Now consider any\nother algebra with operations that not only have the same names but\nalso satisfy the same laws (and possibly more), called a\nmodel of those laws. Such an algebra could serve any of the\nfollowing purposes.\n\n(i) It could tell us to what extent the equational laws holding of the\nintegers characterize the integers. Since the set \\(\\{0, 1\\}\\) of\nintegers mod 2 under addition and negation satisfies all the laws that\nthe integers do, we immediately see that no single equational property\nof the integers tells us that there are infinitely many integers. On\nthe other hand any finite model of the equational theory of the\nintegers necessarily satisfies some law that the integers don\u2019t\nsatisfy, in particular the law \\(x+x+\\ldots +x = 0\\) where the number\nof \\(x\\)\\(s\\) on the left hand side is the size of the\nmodel. Since the equational theory of the integers contains no such\nlaw we can tell from its theory as a whole that the integers must be\nan infinite set. On the other hand the rational numbers under addition\nand negation satisfy exactly the same equational properties as the\nintegers, so this theory does not characterize the algebra of integers\nunder addition and subtraction with sufficient precision to\ndistinguish it from the rationals.\n\n(ii) It could provide us with a useful new domain that can be\nsubstituted for the integers in any application depending only on\nequational properties of the integers, but which differs from the\nintegers in other (necessarily nonequational) useful respects. For\nexample the rationals, which satisfy the same laws as we just noted,\ndiffer in having the density property, that between any two\nrationals there lies another rational. Another difference is that it\nsupports division: whereas the ratio of two integers is usually not an\ninteger, the ratio of two rationals is always a rational. The reals\nalso satisfy the same equations, and like the rationals are dense and\nsupport division. Unlike the rationals however the reals have the\ncompleteness property, that the set of all upper bounds of\nany nonempty set of reals is either empty or has a least member,\nneeded for convergent sequences to have a limit to converge to.\n\nThis idea extends to other operations such as multiplication and\ndivision, as with fields. A particularly useful case of such a\ngeneralization is given by the use of complex numbers in Cartesian\ngeometry. When \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) range over the field of reals, \\(x^2\n+y^2 =1\\) describes the ordinary Euclidean circle in two dimensions,\nbut when the variables range over the complex numbers this equation\ndescribes the complex counterpart of the circle, visualizable as a\ntwo-dimensional surface embedded in four real dimensions (regarding\nthe complex plane as having two real dimensions). Or if the variables\nrange over the integers mod 7, which form a field under the usual\narithmetic operations mod 7, the circle consists of eight points,\nnamely \\((\\pm 1, 0), (0, \\pm 1)\\), and \\((\\pm 2, \\pm 2)\\). Certain\ntheorems about the Euclidean circle provable purely algebraically\nremain provable about these other kinds of circles because all the\nequations on which the proof depends continue to hold in these other\nfields, for example the theorem that a line intersects a circle in at\nmost two points.\n\n(iii) It could help us decide whether some list of equational laws\nintended to axiomatize the integers is complete in the sense\nthat any equation holding of the integers follows from the laws in\nthat list. If some structure satisfies all the axioms in the list, but\nnot some other equation that holds of the integers, then we have a\nwitness to the incompleteness of the axiomatization. If on the other\nhand we can show how to construct any algebra satisfying the axioms\nfrom the algebra of integers, limiting ourselves only to certain\nalgebraic constructions, then by a theorem of Birkhoff applicable to\nthose constructions we can infer that the axiomatization is\ncomplete.\n\n(iv) It could give another of way of defining a class, besides the\nstandard way of listing axioms. In the case at hand, the class of all\nalgebras with a constant, a unary operation, and a binary operation,\nsatisfying all the laws satisfied by the integers, is exactly the\nclass of abelian groups. \n",
