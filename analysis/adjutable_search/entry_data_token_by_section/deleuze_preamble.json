    "main_text": "\n\nGilles Deleuze (January 18, 1925\u2013November 4, 1995) was one of\nthe most influential and prolific French philosophers of the second\nhalf of the twentieth century. Deleuze conceived of philosophy as the\nproduction of concepts, and he characterized himself as a \u201cpure\nmetaphysician.\u201d In his magnum opus Difference and\nRepetition, he tries to develop a metaphysics adequate to\ncontemporary mathematics and science\u2014a metaphysics in which the\nconcept of multiplicity replaces that of substance, event replaces\nessence and virtuality replaces possibility. Deleuze also produced\nstudies in the history of philosophy (on Hume, Nietzsche, Kant,\nBergson, Spinoza, Foucault, and Leibniz), and on the arts (a\ntwo-volume study of the cinema, books on Proust and Sacher-Masoch, a\nwork on the painter Francis Bacon, and a collection of essays on\nliterature.) Deleuze considered these latter works as pure philosophy,\nand not criticism, since he sought to create the concepts that\ncorrespond to the artistic practices of painters, filmmakers, and\nwriters. In 1968, he met F\u00e9lix Guattari, a political activist\nand radical psychoanalyst, with whom he wrote several works, among\nthem the two-volume Capitalism and Schizophrenia, comprised\nof Anti-Oedipus (1972) and A Thousand Plateaus\n(1980). Their final collaboration was What is Philosophy?\n(1991).\n\nDeleuze is noteworthy for his rejection of the Heideggerian notion of\nthe \u201cend of metaphysics.\u201d In an interview, he once offered\nthis self-assessment: \u201cI feel myself to be a pure\nmetaphysician.... Bergson says that modern science hasn\u2019t found\nits metaphysics, the metaphysics it would need. It is this metaphysics\nthat interests me.\u201d (Villani 1999: 130) We should also point to\nthe extent of his non-philosophical references (inter alia,\ndifferential calculus, thermodynamics, geology, molecular biology,\npopulation genetics, ethology, embryology, anthropology,\npsychoanalysis, economics, linguistics, and even esoteric thought);\nhis colleague Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard spoke of him as a\n\u201clibrary of Babel.\u201d Deleuze\u2019s influence reaches\nbeyond philosophy; his work is approvingly cited by, and his concepts\nput to use by, researchers in architecture, urban studies, geography,\nfilm studies, musicology, anthropology, gender studies, literary\nstudies and other fields.\n\nDeleuze meant for his style to keep readers on their toes, or even to\n\u201cforce\u201d them to rethink their philosophical assumptions.\n(We will discuss this notion of being \u201cforced\u201d to think\nbelow in 3.1.) We will concentrate on the conceptual architecture of\nhis thought, though readers should be aware that, perhaps more than\nwith most philosophers, such a treatment of Deleuze\u2019s work\nremoves much of the performative effect of reading the original.\n",
