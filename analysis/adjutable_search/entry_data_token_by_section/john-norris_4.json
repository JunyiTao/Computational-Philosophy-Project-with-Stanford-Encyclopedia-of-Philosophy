Is the human being a union of an\nimmortal soul and a mortal body? Or is the human being a mere body\nwith mentality somehow added? Descartes, in connection with the\nversion of the real distinction proof in the Sixth\nMeditation, argues that we can know clearly and distinctly that a\nhuman being is a union of two really distinct substances, a soul and a\nbody. Locke, at 4.3.6 of the Essay, states we might be bodies\nwith thought superadded. Norris perceives Locke\u2019s hypothesis as\ncontradicting Cartesian real distinction, so he reestablishes real\ndistinction in his Theory II. His reconstruction of\nDescartes\u2019 proof begins with the realization that the distinction\nbetween the mind and body is not at all like the distinction between\nthe body and shape:\n\nAnd therefore from my being able to conceive a Thinking Being to be,\ntho\u2019 I should suppose extended Being not be, I conclude that the Ideas\nof these things are distinct not by modal Abstraction, as figured\nSubstance and moveable substance, but really and intirely distinct\nfrom one another, and independent one upon another, and that because\nthings whenever they are must be according to their Ideas.\n(29\u201330)\n\n\nThe fact that we can clearly and distinctly conceive of the body\nexisting without the mind and vice versa entails that the body is\nreally distinct from the mind. Ontological relationships are reflected\nin human thought when we are thinking clearly and distinctly, and if a\nmodal abstraction is present, we can be certain that the items under\nconsideration are the modes of a substance. On the other hand, when\none thing can be thought while considering the other as not existing,\nthe things are not modes after all, but really distinct substances.\nOtherwise, there is no criterion of intelligibility, and for Norris\n\u201call Truth is intelligible\u201d (30). If we do not accept the\nstandard of clarity and distinctness, no standard for human judgment\nremains.\n\nIn Cursory Reflections, Norris presses Locke about the nature\nof an idea. Locke\u2019s account of ideas as originating in sensation and\nreflection found at 2.1 of the  Essay is met by Norris with:\n\u201cThese indeed are pretty Smiling Sentences. But before\nwe go a step further I would willingly know of the Author what kind of\nthings these Ideas are which are thus let in at the Gate of the\nSenses\u201d (22). Norris infers that Lockean ideas must be either\nmental substances or modifications, and then presents difficulties for\neither option. For Norris, the foundation of intelligibility can never\nhave an empirical basis. The foundation must be the true nature of\nideas:\n\nWhat else need, and what else can be the immediate\nObject of our Understanding but the Divine Ideas, the Omniform\nEssence of God? This will open to us a plain intelligible Account\nof Human Understanding \u2026Here I can tell what an Idea\nis, viz. the Omniform Essence of God partially represented or\nexhibited, and how it comes to be united with my Mind. But as far for\nall other ways, I look upon them as desperate. (Cursory\nReflections 31)\n\n\nIn addition to the defense of real distinction, Norris questions\nLocke\u2019s suggestion that we might be thinking matter. Norris, along\nwith many of his contemporaries, questions the mechanisms by which\nmatter could be endowed with thought. Mary Astell, with whom Norris\ncorresponded, is as confounded when she wonders whether God \u201cmay\naccording to the good Pleasure of His Omnipotency, give it [a\ntriangle] a good speaking, a walking, or a\ndancing Faculty, and make it able to Eat and Drink\u201d\n(Christian Religion 254\u2013255, brackets added). Astell\u2019s\nassumption here is shared by Norris; things are what they are\naccording to their essences, which are determined by God\u2019s ideas.\nExtended bodies cannot reveal mental states through walking and\ndancing, only minds are capable of initiating such acts. Norris\nutilizes this assumption in one of his arguments against the thinking\nmatter hypothesis:\n\nIn other words, If a Thinking Being and an Extended Being be really\none Idea, that is\u2026if the very same Being be in Idea both\nThinking and Extended, however by us considered sometimes under one\nFormality, and sometimes under another, then the Production of a\nThinking Being would be also the Production of an Extended Being, and\nso they could not be produced apart. But we suppose them separately\nproduceable, and thence think we have reason to conclude that their\nIdeas are completely and intirely distinct Ideas, and not the same\nIdea incompletely considered. (Theory II 36\u201337)\n\n\nSince bodies are sometimes separately produced from minds, God does\nnot create them from the same idea. Body and mind are created from\ndifferent ideas; they have separate essences.\n\nWhereas Locke argues that the human being might, for all we know, be\nmatter with thought superadded, Norris claims in no uncertain terms\nthat the human being is a substantial union. However, Norris can only\nargue for his claim within his ideal philosophy, which Locke rejects.\nBut the grounds for rejection spring from the very view of\n\u2018idea\u2019 Locke espouses; an idea is generated and formed by\nsensation and reflection. This debate concerns, fundamentally, the\nontological status of ideas, and how far ideas can guarantee a\ncorrespondence to reality external to thought. In this debate, the\nreader can fully appreciate one main difference between Cartesian\nrationalism and Lockean empiricism in late 17th Century\nEngland. For Locke, propositions about ideas are themselves mere\nmental propositions. As such, their certainty does not guarantee\ntruth. For Norris, clear and distinct mental propositions reflect\nideal propositions. Certainty about mental propositions does guarantee\ntruth.\n\nNorris offers an important insight into how the real distinction proof\ndepends on abstractive processes. However, like Malebranche, Norris\nclaims that we have no access to God\u2019s idea of the mind. The mind\u2019s\nexistence is known only by inner consciousness, or sentiment. This\nraises the same problems for Norris that Malebranche has defending the\nproof. (See Nolan and Whipple 2005.) If humanity is ignorant about the\nessence of the soul, then there can be no proof using the essence of\nthe soul as a premise; we cannot know if the proposition, \u2018The\nmind is a substance\u2019, is true or false. At best, it is\nindeterminate. So, whether Norris can fully defend the proof is\nquestionable. Nonetheless, Norris argues for the immortality of the\nsoul in A Philosophical Discourse concerning the Natural\nImmortality of the Soul in response to a work published by Henry\nDodwell. Dodwell held that all souls are material, and only a few\nsouls are granted immortality. Norris, relying upon the essence of the\nsoul as immaterial, draws a distinction between the indissolvible and\nthe imperishable (33\u201334). The soul is naturally indissolvible\nbecause it is indivisible, but it is not imperishable. If God ceased\nhis constant creation, all things would immediately cease to\nexist.\n\nNorris dedicates a chapter in Theory II to the topic of\nanimals. Descartes and Malebranche had held that animals are mere\nmachines. Norris agrees there are good reasons to believe that animals\nare machines, but it is possible that they have souls because\n\u201c\u2019tis easy to err in the Dark.\u201d Norris discourages\n\u201cany practices of Cruelty, upon the Bodies of these Creatures,\nwhich the Lord of Creation has\u2026subjected to our Power.\u201d\nHe advises us to treat animals \u201cwith as much tenderness and\npitiful regard, as if they had all that Sense and Perception, which is\ncommonly\u2026attributed to them\u201d (100).\n",
