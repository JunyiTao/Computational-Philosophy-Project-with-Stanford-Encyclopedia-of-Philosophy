A \u201cmode of\nX\u201d might be\n\nan intrinsic property of X (e.g., a power of X,\nan action of X)\na relation that X bears to some thing or things (e.g.,\nX\u2019s loving itself, X\u2019s being greater\nthan Y, X appearing wonderful to Y and to\nZ)\na state of affairs or event which includes X (e.g.,\nX loving Y, it being the case that X is\ngreat)\n\n\nOne-self trinitarians often seem to have in mind the last of these.\n(E.g., The Son is the event of God\u2019s relating to us as friend\nand savior. Or the Son is the event of God\u2019s taking on flesh and\nliving and dying to reveal the Father to humankind. Or the Son is the\neternal event or state of affairs of God\u2019s living in a son-like\nway.) If an event is (in the simplest case) a substance (thing) having\na property (or a relation) at a time, then the Son (etc.) will be\nidentified with God\u2019s having a certain property, or being in a\ncertain relation, at a time (or timelessly). By a natural slide of\nthought and language, the Son (or Spirit) may just be thought of and\nspoken of as a certain divine property, rather than God\u2019s having\nof it (e.g., God\u2019s wisdom).\n\nModes may be essential to the thing or not; a mode may be something a\nthing could exist without, or something which it must always have so\nlong as it exists. (Or on another way to understand the\nessential/non-essential distinction, a mode may belong to a\nthing\u2019s definition or not.)\n\nThere are three ways these modes of an eternal being may be temporally\nrelated to one another: maximally overlapping, non-overlapping, or\npartially overlapping. First, they may be eternally\nconcurrent\u2014such that this being always, or timelessly, has all\nof them. Second, they may be strictly sequential (non-overlapping):\nfirst the being has only one, then only another, then only another.\nFinally, some of the modes may be had at the same times, partially\noverlapping in time.\n",
