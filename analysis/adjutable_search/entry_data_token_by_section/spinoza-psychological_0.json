The Human Being as Part of Nature\n\n\nIn the Preface to Part III, Spinoza states his view that all things\nalike must be understood to follow from the laws of nature: \nThe laws and rules of nature, according to which all things\nhappen, and change from one form to another, are always and everywhere\nthe same. So the way of understanding the nature of anything, of\nwhatever kind, must also be the same, viz. through the universal laws\nof nature.\n\n Many philosophers have treated the human mind as an exception to\notherwise universal natural laws, as a thing that is conscious, that\nis capable of good and evil, or that can be an uncaused cause of\naction, for example. Spinoza though insists that human beings are not\n\u201coutside nature.\u201d Any features or deeds of human beings that seem\nexceptional, then, must have for Spinoza some explanation in terms of\nuniversal, natural laws. That is, if there is any sense at all in\nsaying that a human being is aware, does good, and is free, then\nthere must be universal, natural laws that justify and explain these\ndesignations.\n\n\nSpinoza\u2019s thesis (IIIp7) that the essence of any finite mode,\nincluding any human mind (IIIp9), is a striving (conatus) to\npersevere in being is an attempt to give an account of nature under\nwhich human beings with their apparent peculiarities are natural.\nSpinoza argues that all finite modes strive to persevere in being\n(IIIp6), and he uses an analysis of human striving to explain the\nconscious experience of desire, human freedom, and good and evil in\nterms that might apply to any finite modes. Desire, as Spinoza\nunderstands it, just is striving together with consciousness of\nstriving (IIIp9s; the human experience of desire is discussed in more\ndetail in Section 2.1). An action of a human mind cannot be free, for\nSpinoza, in the sense of being determined by a faculty of will that is\nitself undetermined (IIp48; see also letter 58, to Schuller). There is human freedom for Spinoza,\nhowever, in the sense of freedom from external interference: I am free\nin producing some effect (that is, in doing something) to the extent that the effect\nfollows from my essence, or, in other words, to the extent that it is the effect\nof my striving. (For discussions of action and human freedom,\nsee IIId2 and V Preface.) \u2018Good\u2019 and \u2018evil\u2019\nare labels that describe natural properties in the sense that they\ndescribe changes that might occur in any particular things at all\n(although we reserve the labels for these changes when they occur in\nhuman beings).  Although scholars debate the precise meaning of these\nidentifications, an increase in the power with which a mind strives is\ngood, for Spinoza, and a decrease evil (see IIIp11s, IIIp39s and IV\nPreface).  Because the striving thesis thus makes central\ncontributions to Spinoza\u2019s accounts of consciousness, of human freedom\nand of good and evil, it is of great importance to Spinoza\u2019s\npsychology and ethics. One might raise questions about the validity of\nSpinoza\u2019s argument to the doctrine, about its plausibility as an\naccount of the nature of particular objects, or about its plausibility\nas an account of human nature. The subsections which follow address\nthese issues in turn.\n",
