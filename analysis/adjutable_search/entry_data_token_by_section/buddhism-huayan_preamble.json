    "main_text": "\n\nHuayan is one of the most philosophically interesting and historically\ninfluential Buddhist schools. The distinctive contributions of Huayan\ninclude the doctrines that \u201cone is all, and all is one,\u201d\nthat ultimate reality is ontologically identical with the illusory\nworld of common sense, and that realizing these facts leads to\nuniversal compassion. Huayan is known also for the incisive nature of\nits arguments, particularly in Fazang\u2019s \u201cRafter\nDialogue\u201d and Zongmi\u2019s On the Origin of\nHumanity.\n\nThe Chinese term \u201cHuayan\u201d means \u201cFlower\nGarland\u201d and comes from the Avatamsaka Sutra\n(Flower Garland Sutra), an Indian Sanskrit text. Huayan also\nshows the influence of the Madhyamaka doctrine of Nagarjuna, the\nYogacara School, and the teachings of Awakening of Faith in\nMahayana. However, Huayan is a distinctively Chinese form of\nBuddhism, particularly for the way that it interprets\n\u201cemptiness\u201d in terms of \u201cinterdependence\u201d and\ntreats the natural world as possessing intrinsic value. Huayan spread\nto Korea (where it was known as \u201cHwaeom\u201d) and to Japan\n(where it was called \u201cKegon\u201d). Like other forms of Chinese\nBuddhism, Huayan identified a series of patriarchs who allegedly\ntransmitted the orthodox teachings of the tradition from master to\ndisciple. Of these, the two most important are Fazang and Zongmi.\n\nAlthough the vitality of the school in China lapsed after the\npersecution of Buddhism by Emperor Wuzong (842\u2013846 CE), its doctrines,\nmetaphors, and vocabulary had a significant influence on Chan (Zen)\nBuddhism and the Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming dynasties.\n",
