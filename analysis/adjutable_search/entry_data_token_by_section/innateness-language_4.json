Other Research Bearing on the Innateness of Language: New Problems for the Nativist?\n\n\nIn this section, I will mention some other avenues of research that \nhave been argued to have a bearing on the innateness of language. My \ngoal is not to give an exhaustive survey of these matters, but rather\nto provide the interested reader with a way into the relevant \nliteratures. Still, I will try to give enough details so as to make a\ncase that current empirical findings, together with the flaws \nidentified in \u00a7\u00a71 and 2 in the positive arguments for \nlinguistic nativism, tend to militate against that position.\n",
