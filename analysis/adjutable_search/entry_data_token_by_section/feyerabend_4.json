But in fact this is one of the periods he\ntells us most about. Having passed his final high school exams in\nMarch 1942, he was drafted into the Arbeitsdienst (the work\nservice introduced by the Nazis), and sent for basic training in\nPirmasens, Germany. Feyerabend opted to stay in Germany to keep out of\nthe way of the fighting, but subsequently asked to be sent to where\nthe fighting was, having become bored with cleaning the barracks! He\neven considered joining the SS, for aesthetic reasons. His unit was\nthen posted at Quelerne en Bas, near Brest, in Brittany. Still, the\nevents of the war did not register. In November 1942, he returned home\nto Vienna, but left before Christmas to join the Wehrmacht\u2019s\nPioneer Corps. \n\nTheir training took place in Krems, near Vienna. Feyerabend soon\nvolunteered for officers\u2019 school, not because of an urge for\nleadership, but out of a wish to survive, his intention being to use\nofficers\u2019 school as a way to avoid front-line fighting. The\ntrainees were sent to Yugoslavia. In Vukovar, during July 1943, he\nlearnt of his mother\u2019s suicide, but was absolutely unmoved, and\nobviously shocked his fellow officers by displaying no feeling. In\nDecember that same year, Feyerabend\u2019s unit was sent into battle\non the northern part of the Russian front, but although they blew up\nbuildings, they never encountered any Russian soldiers.\n\nDespite the fact that Feyerabend reports of himself that he was\nfoolhardy during battle, treating it as a theatrical event, he\nreceived the Iron Cross (second class) early in March 1944, for\nleading his men into a village under enemy fire, and occupying it. He\nwas advanced from private soldier to lance corporal, to sergeant, and\nthen, at the end of 1944, to lieutenant. At the end of November that\nyear, he gave a series of lectures to the officers\u2019 school at\nDessau Rosslau, near Leipzig. Their theme was the\n(\u201chistoricist\u201d) one that \u201chistorical periods such as\nthe Baroque, the Rococo, the Gothic Age are unified by a concealed\nessence that only a lonely outsider can understand\u201d (p. 49). His\ndescription of these lectures, and of his notebook entries at the\ntime, reveals the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche in their\nfascination with this \u201clonely outsider\u201d, \u201cthe\nsolitary thinker\u201d (p. 48).\n\nHaving returned home for Christmas 1944, Feyerabend again boarded the\ntrain for the front, this time for Poland, in January 1945. There he\nwas put in charge of a bicycle company. Although he claims to have\nrelished the role of army officer no more than he later did that of\nuniversity professor, he must have been at least a competent soldier,\nsince in the field he came to take the place of a sequence of injured\nofficers: first a lieutenant, then a captain, and then a major, before\nhe was shot during another heroic act of carelessness performed in the\n1945 retreat westwards from the Russian army. The bullet lodged in his\nspine left him temporarily paralysed from the waist down, meaning that\nhe spent time in a wheelchair, then on crutches, and thereafter walked\nwith the aid of a stick. The war ended as he was recovering from his\ninjury, in a hospital in Apolda, a little town near Weimar, while\nfervently hoping not to recover before the war was over.\nGermany\u2019s surrender came as a relief, but also as a\ndisappointment relative to past hopes and aspirations. He later said\nof his stint in the army that it was \u201can interruption, a\nnuisance; I forgot about it the moment it was over\u201d (p.\n111).\n",
