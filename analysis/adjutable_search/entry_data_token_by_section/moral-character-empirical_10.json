    "main_text": "Positive Psychology and the VIA || Background\n4.1 Background\n\nThe canonical approach to character traits in positive psychology is\nfound in Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and\nClassification, edited by Christopher Peterson and Martin\nSeligman and published in 2004. Peterson and Seligman, with the help\nof over 50 leading scholars working on character, put together a\nclassification of character traits which they saw as a \u201cmanual\nof the sanities\u201d (2004: 4) by focusing on psychological health\nrather than illness, as so much of the field had done prior to the\npositive psychology movement.\n\nTo develop their classification, they scoured writings from traditions\nsuch as Confucianism, Buddhism, ancient Greek philosophy, and medieval\nIslam. They examined lists of traits from Charlemagne, Benjamin\nFranklin, the Boy and Girl Scouts, Hallmark greeting cards, and\nPok\u00e9mon characters (2004: 15, 33\u201352). Naturally they came\nup with a huge list of traits, and needed some criteria to use to pare\nthem down. Here are the 10 criteria they came up with (2004:\n17\u201327):\n\nA strength contributes to various fulfillments that constitute the\ngood life, for oneself and for others.\nEach strength is morally valued in its own right, even in the\nabsence of obvious beneficial outcomes.\nThe display of a strength by one person does not diminish other\npeople in the vicinity.\nBeing able to phrase the \u201copposite\u201d of a putative\nstrength in a felicitous way counts against regarding it as a\ncharacter strength.\nIt should be traitlike in the sense of having a degree of\ngenerality across situations and stability across time.\nThe strength is distinct from other positive traits in the\nclassification and cannot be decomposed into them.\nThe character strength is embodied in consensual paragons.\nAn additional criterion where sensible is the existence of\nprodigies with respect to the strength.\nThe existence of people who show\u2014selectively\u2014the total\nabsence of a given strength.\nThe larger society provides institutions and associated rituals\nfor cultivating strengths and virtues and then for sustaining their\npractice.\n\n\nUsing these criteria, Peterson and Seligman arrived at a\nclassification with 6 \u201cvirtues\u201d and 24 \u201ccharacter\nstrengths\u201d, which today goes by the name of the Values in Action\nor VIA classification. Virtues are defined as \u201ccore\ncharacteristics valued by moral philosophers and religious\nthinkers\u201d (2004: 13). Character strengths are:\n\n\nthe psychological ingredients\u2014processes or mechanisms\u2014that\ndefine the virtues. Said another way, they are distinguishable routes\nto displaying one or another of the virtues (2004: 13).\n\n\nTogether the virtues and character strengths make up the official VIA\nclassification (2004: 29\u201330):\n\n\n\nWisdom\nCreativity\n\nCuriosity\n\nOpen-mindedness\n\nLove of Learning\n\nPerspective \n\nCourage\nBravery\n\nPersistence\n\nIntegrity\n\nVitality \n\nHumanity\nLove\n\nKindness\n\nSocial Intelligence \n\nJustice\nCitizenship\n\nFairness\n\nLeadership \n\nTemperance\nForgiveness and Mercy\n\nHumility/Modesty\n\nPrudence\n\nSelf-Regulation \n\nTranscendence\nAppreciation of Beauty and Excellence\n\nGratitude\n\nHope\n\nHumor\n\nSpirituality  \n\n\nNaturally Peterson and Seligman have a great deal to say in clarifying\nwhat each of these means. But here it is important to keep a few more\ngeneral points in mind.\n\nFirst, Peterson and Seligman are explicit that they do not think this\nclassification is exhaustive, and are open to additions or deletions\n(2004: 13; see also Peterson and Park 2009: 27). Second, they\nacknowledge that \u201cIn some cases, the classification of a given\nstrength under a core virtue can be debated\u201d (Peterson and\nSeligman 2004: 28, 31). And finally, they \u201cregard these\nstrengths as ubiquitously recognized and valued, although a given\nindividual will rarely, if ever, display all of them\u201d (2004:\n13).\n\nResearch making use of the VIA has been extensive, with many studies\nin particular looking at correlations between particular character\nstrengths and other variables like health and educational success (for\na review, see Niemiec 2013). Peterson and Seligman have also developed\nseveral assessment tools for character strengths, the main one of\nwhich is the VIA-IS. This 240 item measure uses a 5-point Likert scale\nanchored on \u201cvery much like me\u201d and \u201cvery much\nunlike me\u201d (2004: 629). Some example of its items include (2004:\n629):\n\nI am never too busy to help a friend. [kindness]\nI always keep my promises. [integrity]\nI have great difficulty accepting love from anyone. [love]\n\n\nAnyone can take the survey for free at the VIA Institute for Character\nwebsite (see the Other Internet Resources) and learn what their\n\u201csignature strengths\u201d are.\n\nAs always, there is much more to be said, but let us turn to the\nphilosophical relevance.\n",
