    "main_text": "Six central methodological problems || Causation in economics and econometrics\n2.5 Causation in economics and econometrics\n\nMany important generalizations in economics are causal claims. For\nexample, the law of demand asserts that a price increase will\n(ceteris paribus) diminish the quantity demanded. (It does\nnot merely assert an inverse relationship between price and demand.\nWhen demand increases for some other reason, such as a change in\ntastes, price increases.) Econometricians have also been\ndeeply concerned with the possibilities of determining causal\nrelations from statistical evidence and with the relevance of causal\nrelations to the possibility of consistent estimation of parameter\nvalues. Since concerns about the consequences of alternative policies\nare so central to economics, causal inquiry is unavoidable.\n\nBefore the 1930s, economists were generally willing to use causal\nlanguage explicitly and literally, despite some concerns that there\nmight be a conflict between causal analysis of economic changes and\n\u201ccomparative statics\u201d treatments of equilibrium states.\nSome economists were also worried that thinking in terms of causes was\nnot compatible with recognizing the multiplicity and mutuality of\ndetermination in economic equilibrium. In the anti-metaphysical\nintellectual environment of the 1930s and 1940s (of which logical\npositivism was at least symptomatic), any mention of causation became\nsuspicious, and economists commonly pretended to avoid causal\nconcepts. The consequence was that they ceased to reflect carefully on\nthe causal concepts that they continued implicitly to invoke (Hausman\n1983, 1990, Helm 1984, Runde 1998). For example, rather than\nformulating the law of demand in terms of the causal consequences of\nprice changes for quantity demanded, economists tried to confine\nthemselves to discussing the mathematical function relating price and\nquantity demanded. There were important exceptions (Haavelmo 1944,\nSimon 1953, Wold 1954), and during the past generation, this state of\naffairs has changed dramatically.\n\nFor example, in his Causality in Macroeconomics (2001b) Kevin\nHoover develops feasible methods for investigating large scale causal\nquestions, such as whether changes in the money supply (M)\ncause changes in the rate of inflation P or accommodate\nchanges in P that are otherwise caused. If changes in\nM cause changes in P, then the conditional\ndistribution of P on M should remain stable with\nexogenous changes in M, but should change with exogenous\nchanges in P. Hoover argues that historical investigation,\nbacked by statistical inquiry, can justify the conclusion that some\nparticular changes in M or P have been exogenous.\nOne can then determine the causal direction by examining the stability\nof the conditional distributions. Econometricians have made vital\ncontributions to the contemporary revival of philosophical interest in\nthe notion of causation. In addition to Hoover\u2019s work, see for\nexample Geweke (1982), Granger (1969, 1980), Cartwright (1989), Sims\n(1977), Zellner and Aigner (1988), Pearl (2000), Spirtes, Glymour and\nScheines (2001).\n\nOne relatively secure way to determine causal relations is via\nrandomized controlled experiments. If the experimenters sort subjects\nrandomly into experimental and control groups and vary just one\nfactor, then, unless by bad luck the two groups differ in some unknown\nway, changes in the outcomes given the common features of the control\nand treatment groups should be due to the difference in the one\nfactor. Indeed, in the case of quantitative variables, one can\ncalculate average causal effects (Deaton 2010). This makes randomized\ncontrolled trials very attractive, though no panacea, since the\ntreatment and control groups may not be representative of the\npopulation in which policy-makers hope to apply the causal\nconclusions, and the causal consequences of the intervention might\ndiffer across different subgroups within the control and treatment\ngroups (Worrall 2007, Cartwright and Hardie 2013).\n\nFor both practical and ethical reasons, it is often hard to experiment\nin economics (though, as discussed in section 4.5, far from\nimpossible). But with some ingenuity and with far greater enthusiasm\nfor experimentation than had been the case previously, economists are\nexperimenting much more frequently both in the laboratory and in the\nfield. In addition, as a substitute for experimentation, or as a way\nof stretching the limits on experimentation, economists in recent\nyears have become very enthusiastic about so-called\n\u201cinstrumental variable\u201d techniques. For example, merely\nexamining the correlation between economic growth and development aid,\neven controlling for other factors known to influence economic growth\nis unlikely to reveal the causal influence of aid on growth, because\naid may reciprocally depend on growth and well as many factors that\nare hard to measure that also influence growth. These problems can be\nto some extent circumvented if economists can find an\n\u201cinstrumental\u201d variable x upon which aid depends\nthat influences growth (if at all) only by its influence on aid and\nwhich is probabilistically independent of all other determinants of\ngrowth. In that case, one can use the effect of x on growth\nto estimate the effect of aid on growth. Instrumental variable\ntechniques, policy experimentation, and reliance on \u201cnatural\nexperiments\u201d have become widespread, though they bring with them\nnew problems extrapolating experimental results to the target\npopulation (Deaton 2010; Cartwright and Hardie 2013).\n",
