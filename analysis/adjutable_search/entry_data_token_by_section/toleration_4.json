    "main_text": "Justifying Toleration\n5. The Politics of Toleration\n\nAny concrete use of the concept of toleration is always situated in\nparticular contexts of normative and political conflict, especially in\nsocieties that are transforming towards increased religious, ethical\nand cultural pluralism \u2013 even more so when societies are marked\nby an increased awareness of such pluralism, with some cultural groups\nraising new claims for recognition and others looking at their\nco-citizens with suspicion, despite having lived together for some\ntime in the past. These social conflicts always involve group-based\nclaims for recognition, both in the legal and in the social sphere\n(see generally Patten 2014, Galeotti 2002). Contemporary debate has\nfocused on questions of respecting particular religious practices and\nbeliefs, ranging from certain manners of dress, including the burka,\nto certain demands to be free from blasphemy and religious insults\n(Laborde 2008, Newey 2013, Nussbaum 2012, Leiter 2014, Taylor and\nStepan 2014, Modood 2013, Forst 2013, ch. 12). The general questions\nraised here include: What is special about religious as opposed to\nother cultural identities (Laborde and Bardon 2017)? When is equal\nrespect called for and what exactly does it imply with respect to, for\nexample, norms of gender equality (see Okin et al. 1999, Song 2007)?\nWhat role do past injustices play in weighing claims for recognition,\nand how much room can there be for autonomous forms of life in a\ndeeply pluralistic society (Tully 1995, Williams 2000)?\n\nOther connected and intensely debated issues of toleration include\nfree speech and \u201chate speech,\u201d (Butler 1997, Waldron 2012,\nGerstenfeld 2013) as well as the ways in which new forms of digital\ncommunication change the nature of social and political discourse\n(Barnett 2007).\n\nFinally, in light of Goethe\u2019s remark that to tolerate also means\nto insult, those working from the perspective of a critical theory of\ntoleration discuss how power can be exercised not only by denying\ntoleration but also by disciplining when granting toleration (Brown\n2006, Brown and Forst 2014). As much as a politics of toleration aims\nto express mutual respect, it also involves disagreement, mutual\ncriticism, and rejection. We still face the challenge of examining the\ngrounds and forms of a politics of toleration as an emancipatory form\nof politics. \n",
