    "main_text": "Definitions of \u2018_reduces to_\u2019\n4. Definitions of \u2018_reduces to_\u2019\n\nAs discussed above, the term \u2019reduction\u2019 can be\ninterpreted in many ways. These rival explications can be\ndistinguished (i) with respect to how they conceive of the\nrelata of the reduction relation, and (ii) with respect to\nhow they conceive of the conditions the relevant relata have\nto meet in order to instantiate the relation. Often, an epistemic\naspect complements these characterizations. This section groups the\nrival accounts with respect to the objects they offer as candidate\nrelata, and with respect to the links they offer as candidates for the\nconditions the relata have to meet in order to instantiate the\nreduction relation. Three remarks are in place: \n\nIn what follows, only candidates for the primary relata of\nthe reduction relation are listed; it is the primary relata\nwith respect to which philosophers disagree. The distinction between\nprimary and secondary relata can be explained by way\nof example: Patricia Churchland holds that\n\n\n[s]tatements that a phenomenon PR reduces to\nanother phenomenon PB are derivative upon the\nmore basic claim that the theory that characterizes the first reduces\nto the theory that characterizes the second. (Churchland 1986:\n278)\n\n\nOn this view, the relation signified by the reduction-predicate in its\nbasic, or proper use is instantiated by pairs of theories only. A\nderivative notion of reduction (and, hence, a deviant use of\nthe predicate) allows for statements of the form \u2018a\nreduces to b\u2019 to be true, even if the respective\ninstances of \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 do\nnot designate theories. The truth of this statement then depends upon\na corresponding truth about theory-reduction. For example, if water\nreduces to H2O, then on this view it does so only if,\nand if so: in virtue of the fact that folk-chemistry reduces to\nchemistry.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, those who view reduction in terms\nof real world entities rather than theories would not claim that\nstatements of the form \u2018a reduces to b\u2019\nare always false when the instances of \u2018a\u2019 and\n\u2018b\u2019 designate theories, and true only when they\ndesignate properties, or parts and wholes. Rather, they would hold\nthat claims about theory-reductions are derivative upon claims about\nproperty-reductions or that the notion of theory reduction depends\nupon a notion of property reduction in a more ontological sense. Thus\nif folk-chemistry reduces to chemistry, it does so because\nwater reduces to H2O, and because Iron reduces to\nFe, and so on.\n\nSecondly, this way of conceiving of the primary relata of reduction\nsuggests that the reduction-relation is a binary relation. Recall,\nhowever, the observation that on Nagel\u2019s account, in heterogenic\ncases of reduction, no theory reduces to another theory\nsimpliciter; it does so only with respect to certain\nbridge-laws and/or boundary conditions. Depending on how one counts\nthe arity of a relation, i.e., the number of items it relates, this\nmight suggest that even on the classical interpretation, reduction is\nnot a binary relation. More recently, alternative explications have\nbeen suggested according to which reduction is of an arity higher than\n2. Thus, the intuitive notion of primary relata should be tied to the\ndesignata of the expressions flanking the reduction predicate in true\nreduction statements.\n\nFinally, talking about candidate relata, we talk about types\nof objects that possibly function as the relata of an instance of the\nreduction-relation, rather than these objects themselves.\n",
