    "main_text": "Frege\u2019s Philosophy of Language || Frege\u2019s Theory of Sense and Denotation\n3.3 Frege\u2019s Philosophy of Language in Context\n\nIn an important paper, Bobzien (2021) develops an inductively strong\nargument to the conclusion that Frege adopted ideas by the Stoics, as\nthe latter were described in Carl Prantl\u2019s four volume History\nof Western Logic (Geschichte der Logik im Abendland,\n1855\u20131870) and in Diogenes Laertius\u2019 Lives of the\nPhilosophers (Vitae Philosophorum, 2nd century CE). The\nStoic ideas described in these two works originate with Zeno of\nCitium, Cleanthes, Chrysippus of Soli, Diogenes of Babylon, etc., and\nso both works are \u2018secondary\u2019 literature.  The relevant\nreports in Diogenes\u2019 Lives (which are largely quoted in\nPrantl) are among the closest we have to the source material for Stoic\nwritings on language and logic, while Section VI of Volume 1 of\nPrantl\u2019s Geschichte is a 95-page summary of Stoic\nviews.  Bobzien notes how widely read Prantl's work was, and how\nFrege's training left him well-qualified to understand the many quoted\npassages in Greek and Latin in his work. She then compiles evidence to\nthe conclusion that Frege borrowed heavily (and without attribution)\nfrom these works. This evidence is cumulative, for there is no smoking\ngun.  We can't point to any dog-eared copies with marginalia in\nFrege\u2019s own hand, or any copies of works by Prantl and Diogenes\nthat can be traced to Frege\u2019s library, or any records of Frege\nchecking out the works by Prantl and Diogenes from the Jena University\nlibrary.[8]\n\nBut in the 50-page Section III of her paper, Bobzien constructs\nnumerous tables of comparison that place passages from the Stoic and\nFregean corpora side-by-side and interlaces them with observations and\ncareful scholarship that connect the most salient (transliterated)\nGreek phrases with their German counterparts.  The overall effect is a\nkind of res ipsa loquitur \u2013 the thing speaks for itself\n\u2013 and places the ball squarely in the court of those who would\nattempt to deny the identities and similarities.  The evidence doesn't\nchallenge the insight and ingenuity that Frege brought to bear when\nhe formalized the language and logic of mathematics (and\ncertain constructions of natural language) in terms of the 19th\ncentury understanding of functions, and so the formal representations\npresented earlier in this entry were something that was not\nborrowed from the Stoics. And though Frege independently motivated the\nideas he absorbed from the Stoics, Bobzien shows how many aspects of\nFrege\u2019s underlying approach to language is directly founded on\nideas from fifteen hundred years ago and so are not as new as\noriginally thought. \n\nIt remains to get a sense of the range of the elements in common, some\nof which were pointed out by others in previous\n research.[9]\nAt the most general level, Bobzien compares the ways that the Stoics\nand Frege relate semantic \u2018content\u2019 (Greek lekta\nv.  Fregean Sinn) to the linguistic expression of that\ncontent.  Both distinguish the \u2018incomplete\u2019\n(ellip\u0113 v. unges\u00e4ttigt) content of\npredicates from the complete content of sentences, and there are\nparallels in what the Stoics and Frege have to say about complete\n\u2018assertible\u2019 contents (axi\u014dmata\nv. Gedanken), especially in connection with the fact that\nthese contents are the primary bearers of truth and falsity. Bobzien\nthen compares the two philosophies with regard to other kinds of\ncomplete contents, such as those expressed by commands, sentence\nquestions, expressions of emotion, word questions, and indexicals. In\neach case, Frege\u2019s descriptions of the content presented by\nthese linguistic expressions closely follow those of the Stoics.\nAnother group of similarities arises in her comparison of the\ndoctrines regarding complex contents produced with propositional\nconnectives, such as those expressed by sentences with negations\n(including contradictories, double negations, etc.), conjunctions,\ndisjunctions, conditionals, and sentences with \u2018because\u2019.\nA comparison of the two approaches to quantification and universality\nconcludes the paper.\n\nBy producing so many passages in parallel between the Stoic and\nFregean corpora, the details and evidence accumulate, thereby becoming\nincreasingly persuasive. Any student of Frege who wants to understand\nthe full range of his views on language will have to come to grips\nwith how those views are related to Stoic philosophy. Though Bobzien duly\nnotes the others who had previously remarked on some of the\nsimilarities (see again \n footnote 9), her paper of\n2021 is a good place to start, since the evidence assembled there is\nso comprehensive.\n",
