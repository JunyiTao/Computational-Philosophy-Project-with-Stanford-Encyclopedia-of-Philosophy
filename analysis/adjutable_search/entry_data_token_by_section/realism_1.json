Views Opposing the Existence Dimension (I): Error-Theory and Arithmetic\n\nThere are at least two distinct ways in which a non-realist can reject\nthe existence dimension of realism about a particular subject matter.\nThe first of these rejects the existence dimension by rejecting the\nclaim that the distinctive objects of that subject-matter exist, while\nthe second admits that those objects exist but denies that they\ninstantiate any of the properties distinctive of that subject-matter.\nNon-realism of the first kind can be illustrated via Hartry\nField\u2019s error-theoretic account of arithmetic, and non-realism\nof the second kind via J.L. Mackie\u2019s error-theoretic account of\nmorals. This will show how realism about a subject-matter can be\nquestioned on both epistemological and metaphysical grounds.\n\nAccording to a platonist about arithmetic, the truth of the\nsentence \u20187 is prime\u2019 entails the existence of an\nabstract object, the number 7. This object is abstract\nbecause it has no spatial or temporal location, and is causally inert.\nA platonic realist about arithmetic will say that the number\n7 exists and instantiates the property of being prime independently of\nanyone\u2019s beliefs, linguistic practices, conceptual schemes, and\nso on. A certain kind of nominalist rejects the existence claim which\nthe platonic realist makes: there are no abstract objects, so\nsentences such as \u20187 is prime\u2019 are false (hence\nthe name \u2018error-theory\u2019). Platonists divide on their\naccount of the epistemology of arithmetic: some claim that our\nknowledge of arithmetical fact proceeds by way of some\nquasi-perceptual encounter with the abstract realm (G\u00f6del 1983),\nwhile others have attempted to resuscitate a qualified form of\nFrege\u2019s logicist project of grounding knowledge of\narithmetical fact in knowledge of logic (Wright 1983, Hale 1987, Hale\nand Wright 2001).\n\nThe main arguments against platonic realism turn on the idea that the\nplatonist position precludes a satisfactory epistemology of\narithmetic. For the classic exposition of the doubt that platonism can\nsquare its claims to accommodate knowledge of arithmetical truth with\nits conception of the subject matter of arithmetic as causally inert,\nsee Benacerraf (1973). Benacerraf argued that platonism faces\ndifficulties in squaring its conception of the subject-matter of\narithmetic with a general causal constraint on knowledge (roughly,\nthat a subject can be said to know that P only if she stands\nin some causal relation to the subject matter of P). In\nresponse, platonists have attacked the idea that a plausible causal\nconstraint on ascriptions of knowledge can be formulated (Wright 1983\nCh.2, Hale 1987 Ch.4). In response, Hartry Field, on the side of the\nanti-platonists, has developed a new variant of Benacerraf\u2019s\nepistemological challenge which does not depend for its force on\nmaintaining a generalised causal constraint on ascriptions of\nknowledge. Rather, Field argues that \u2018we should view with\nsuspicion any claim to know facts about a certain domain if we believe\nit impossible to explain the reliability of our beliefs about that\ndomain\u2019 (Field 1989: 232\u20133). Field\u2019s challenge to\nthe platonist is to offer an account of what such a platonist should\nregard as a datum\u2014i.e. that when \u2018p\u2019 is\nreplaced by a mathematical sentence, the following schema holds in\nmost instances:\n\nIf mathematicians accept \u2018p\u2019 then p.\n(1989: 230)\n\n\nField\u2019s point is not simply, echoing Benacerraf, that no causal\naccount of reliability will be available to the platonist, and\ntherefore to the platonic realist. Rather, Field suggests that not\nonly has the platonic realist no recourse to any explanation of\nreliability that is causal in character, but that she has no recourse\nto any explanation that is non-causal in character either. \n\n(T)here seems prima facie to be a difficulty in principle in\nexplaining the regularity. The problem arises in part from the fact\nthat mathematical entities as the [platonic realist] conceives them,\ndo not causally interact with mathematicians, or indeed with anything\nelse. This means we cannot explain the mathematicians beliefs and\nutterances on the basis of the mathematical facts being causally\ninvolved in the production of those beliefs and utterances; or on the\nbasis of the beliefs or utterances causally producing the mathematical\nfacts; or on the basis of some common cause producing both. Perhaps\nthen some sort of non-causal explanation of the correlation is\npossible? Perhaps; but it is very hard to see what this supposed\nnon-causal explanation could be. Recall that on the usual platonist\npicture [i.e. platonic realism], mathematical objects are supposed to\nbe mind- and language-independent; they are supposed to bear no\nspatiotemporal relations to anything, etc. The problem is that the\nclaims that the [platonic realist] makes about mathematical objects\nappears to rule out any reasonable strategy for explaining the\nsystematic correlation in question. (1989: 230\u20131)\n\n\nThis suggests the following dilemma for the platonic realist:\n\nPlatonic realism is committed to the existence of acausal objects\nand to the claim that these objects, and facts about them, are\nindependent of anyone\u2019s beliefs, linguistic practices,\nconceptual schemes, and so on (in short to the claim that these\nobjects, and facts about them, are language- and\nmind-independent).\nAny causal explanation of reliability is incompatible with the\nacausality of mathematical objects.\nAny non-causal explanation of reliability is incompatible with the\nlanguage- and mind-independence of mathematical objects.\nAny explanation of reliability must be causal or non-causal.\nThere is no explanation of reliability that is compatible with\nboth the acausality and language- and mind-independence of\nmathematical objects.\n\n\nTherefore,\nThere is no explanation of reliability that is compatible with\nplatonic realism.\n\n\nWhether there is a version of platonic realism with the resources to\nsee off Field\u2019s epistemological challenge is very much a live\nissue (see Hale 1994, Divers and Miller 1999. For replies to Divers\nand Miller see Sosa 2002, Shapiro 2007 and Piazza 2011, Paseau\n2012).\n\nField\u2019s alternative proposal to platonic realism (1980, 1989) is\nthat although mathematical sentences such as \u20187 is prime\u2019\nare false, the utility of mathematical theories can be explained\notherwise than in terms of their truth. For Field, the utility of\nmathematical theories resides not in their truth but in their\nconservativeness, where a mathematical theory S is\nconservative if and only if for any nominalistically respectable\nstatement A (i.e. a statement whose truth does not imply the\nexistence of abstract objects) and any body of such statements\nN, A is not a consequence of the conjunction of\nN and S unless A is a consequence of\nN alone (Field 1989: 125). In short, mathematics is useful,\nnot because it allows you to derive conclusions that you\ncouldn\u2019t have derived from nominalistically respectable premises\nalone, but rather because it makes the derivation of those\n(nominalistically respectable) conclusions easier than it might\notherwise have been. Whether or not Field\u2019s particular brand of\nerror-theory about arithmetic is plausible is a topic of some debate,\nwhich unfortunately cannot be pursued further here (see Hale and\nWright 2001).\n",
