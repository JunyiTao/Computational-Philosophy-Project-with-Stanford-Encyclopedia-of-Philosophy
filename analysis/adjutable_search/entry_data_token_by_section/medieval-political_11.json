Carolingian Political Thought\n\nThe period in the history of Latin Europe after that of the\n\u201cFathers of the Church\u201d has traditionally been called the\n\u201cdark age\u201d, because very few writings were produced then.\nIt was followed by what has sometimes been called \u201cThe\nCarolingian Renaissance\u201d, associated with the court of\nCharlemagne, toward the end of the eighth century. The political\nwriters of the ninth century\u2014e.g., Hincmar of Rheims (c.\n805/6\u201381), Rabanus Maurus (780\u2013856), Jonas of\nOrl\u00e9ans (c. 780\u2013842/3)\u2014are not household names, yet\nthey gave expression to ideas that were important throughout the rest\nof the middle ages, in particular ideas about the role of a king and\nthe difference between king and\n tyrant.[18]\n\n\nAccording to these writers, the king is in some sense a religious\nfigure (Oakley 2010: 143ff.). This meant that the king could involve\nhimself in religious matters much more than would later be acceptable\nto the medieval church, but it also meant that the king was to be\ninstructed in his duties by the clergy. Some of the writings of this\nperiod belong to what modern scholars call the \u201cmirror of\nprinces\u201d genre. An early example was written by Jonas of\nOrl\u00e9ans (1983) in about 831, which is a good example, too, of\nhow the genre was rarely limited to only discussions of the secular\n power.[19]\n Writers taught the king that he had a duty to do justice. This was\noften construed as meaning that the king had a duty to enforce and\nalso to obey the law, and the law was thought of as partly custom,\npartly royal decree, but also as something based on the consent of the\n people.[20]\n It was suggested\u2014notably, e.g., by Hincmar of Rheims\u2014that\na king might be deposed if he failed to obey the laws and lost the\nconsent of the people (Carlyle and Carlyle 1903: vol. 1,\n242\u201352).\n",
