    "main_text": "The Structuralist Conception || Demarcation, Accuracy, Style, and Target-end Structure\n4.3 Demarcation, Accuracy, Style, and Target-end Structure\n\nStructuralism\u2019s stand on the Demarcation Problem is by and large\nan open question. Unlike similarity, which has been widely discussed\nacross different domains, structural mappings are tied closely to the\nformal framework of set theory, and have been discussed only sparingly\noutside the context of the mathematized sciences. An exception is\nFrench (2003), who discusses isomorphism accounts in the context of\npictorial representation. He considers in detail Budd\u2019s (1993)\naccount of pictorial representation and points out that it is based on\nthe notion of a structural isomorphism between the structure of the\nsurface of the painting and the structure of the relevant visual\nfield. Therefore representation is the perceived isomorphism of\nstructure (French 2003: 1475\u20131476) (this point is reaffirmed by\nBueno and French (2011: 864\u2013865); see Downes (2009:\n423\u2013425) and Isaac (2019) for critical discussions).\n\nThe Problem of Style is to identify representational styles and\ncharacterise them. A proposed structural mapping between the model and\nthe target offers an obvious response to this challenge: one can\nrepresent a system by coming up with a model that is proposed to be\nappropriately morphic to it. This delivers the isomorphism-style, the\nhomomorphism-style, the partial-isomorphism style and so on. We can\ncall these \u201cmorphism-styles\u201d when referring to them in\ngeneral. Each of these styles also offers a clear-cut condition of\naccuracy: the representation is accurate if the hypothesised morphism\nholds; it is inaccurate if it doesn\u2019t.\n\nThis is neat answer. The question is what status it has\nvis-\u00e0-vis the Problem of Style. Are morphism-styles\nmerely a subgroup of styles or are they privileged? The former is\nuncontentious. However, the emphasis many structuralists place on\nstructure preserving mappings suggests that they do not regard\nmorphisms as merely one way among others to represent something. What\nthey seem to have in mind is the stronger claim that a representation\nmust be of that sort, or that morphism-styles are the only\nacceptable styles.\n\nThis claim seems to conflict with scientific practice in at least two\nrespects. Firstly, many representations are inaccurate (and known to\nbe) in some way. Some models distort, deform and twist properties of\nthe target in ways that seem to undercut isomorphism, or indeed any of\nthe proposed structure preserving mappings. Some models in statistical\nmechanics have an infinite number of particles and the Newtonian model\nof the solar system represents the sun as a perfect sphere where in\nreality it is fiery ball with no well-defined surface at all. It is at\nbest unclear how isomorphism, partial or otherwise, or homomorphism\ncan account for these kinds of idealisations. So it seems that styles\nof representation other than structure preserving mappings have to be\nrecognised.\n\nSecondly, the structuralist view is a rational reconstruction of\nscientific modelling, and as such it has some distance from the actual\npractice. Some philosophers have worried that this distance is too\nlarge and that the view is too far removed from the actual practice of\nscience to be able to capture what matters to the practice of\nmodelling (this is the thrust of many contributions to Morgan and\nMorrison 1999; see also Cartwright 1999). Although some models used by\nscientists may be best thought of as set theoretic structures, there\nare many where this seems to contradict how scientists actually talk\nabout, and reason with, their models. Obvious examples include\nphysical models like the San Francisco Bay model (Weisberg 2013), but\nalso systems such as the idealized pendulum or imaginary populations\nof interbreeding animals. Such models have the strange property of\nbeing concrete-if-real and scientists talk about them as if\nthey were real systems, despite the fact that they are obviously not\n(Godfrey-Smith 2006). Thomson-Jones (2010) dubs this \u201cface value\npractice\u201d, and there is a question whether structuralism can\naccount for that practice.\n\nThere remains a final problem to be addressed in the context of\nstructural accounts of scientific representation. Target systems are\nphysical objects: atoms, planets, populations of rabbits, economic\nagents, etc. Isomorphism is a relation that holds between two\nstructures and claiming that a set theoretic structure is isomorphic\nto a piece of the physical world is prima facie a category\nmistake. By definition, a morphism can only hold between two\nstructures. If we are to make sense of the claim that the model is\nisomorphic to its target we have to assume that the target somehow\nexhibits a certain structure \\(\\mathcal{S}_T\\). But what does it mean\nfor a target system\u2014a part of the physical world\u2014to\npossess a structure, and where in the target system is the structure\nlocated?\n\nThere are two prominent suggestions in the literature. The first,\noriginally suggested by Suppes (1962 [1969]), is that data models are\nthe target-end structures represented by models. This approach faces a\nquestion whether we should be satisfied with an account of scientific\nrepresentation that precludes phenomena being represented (see Bogen\nand Woodward (1988) for a discussion of the distinction between data\nand phenomena, and Brading and Landry (2006) for a discussion of the\ndistinction in the context of scientific representation). Van Fraassen\n(2008) has addressed this problem and argues for a pragmatic\nresolution: in the context of use, there is no pragmatic difference\nbetween representing phenomena and data extracted from it (see Nguyen\n2016 for a critical discussion). The alternative approach locates the\ntarget-end structure in the target system itself. One version of this\napproach sees structures as being instantiated in target\nsystems. This view seems to be implicit in many versions of the\nsemantic view, and it is explicitly held by authors arguing for a\nstructuralist answer to the problem of the applicability of\nmathematics (Resnik 1997; Shapiro 1997). This approach faces\nunderdetermination issues in that the same target can instantiate\ndifferent structures. The issue can be seen as arising due to there\nbeing alternative descriptions of the system (Frigg 2006) or because a\nversion of \u201cNewman\u2019s Objection\u201d also bites in the\ncurrent context (Newman 1928; see Ainsworth 2009 and Ketland 2004 for\nfurther discussion). A more radical version simply identifies\ntargets with structures (Tegmark 2008). This approach is highly\nrevisionary in particular when considering target systems like\npopulations of breeding rabbits or economies. So the question remains\nfor any structuralist account of scientific representation: where are\nthe required target-end structures to be found?\n",
