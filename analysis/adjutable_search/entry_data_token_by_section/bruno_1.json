    "main_text": "The Wisdom of the Ancients\n2. The Wisdom of the Ancients\n\nBruno\u2019s philosophy\u2014despite its inconsistent terminology,\nintricacies, eclecticism and willful contrariness\u2014has an inner\ncoherence. Indeed, he can claim to be the first thinker since\nantiquity to integrate a metaphysics, physics, psychology and ethics\ninto an original, if unsystematically presented, philosophy, one that\naspired to go beyond the reelaborations of Platonism, Aristotelianism\nor scepticism within a Christian context that had hitherto prevailed.\nThe outcome was a radical alternative to medieval and Renaissance\ninterpretations of human nature, the cosmos and God. His philosophy\nremained, however, in one decisive respect a creation of the\nRenaissance: neither celestial nor terrestrial mechanics were\nreducible to mathematical abstractions. His treatment of\nCopernicus\u2019s heliocentric hypothesis, discussed in the following\nsection, exemplifies his approach in this respect.\n\nThe coherence stems from his interpretation of ancient learning. From,\nprincipally, the fifteenth-century Christian Platonist Marsilio\nFicino, he learned of the gentile tradition of wisdom, the\n\u201cancient philosophy\u201d, that had allegedly originated with\nsages such as Zoroaster in Persia and Hermes Trismegistus in Egypt.\nOrpheus, Pythagoras and other early Greek thinkers had imbibed this\nwisdom and transmitted it to Plato, among many others. Through innate\npowers of mind, divine inspiration or direct or indirect knowledge of\nJewish lore, these sages and philosophers had acquired intimations of\nmany, indeed most, of the essential tenets of Christianity. Hence,\nconcluded Ficino, the study of ancient Greek philosophy, especially\nPlatonism, could rightfully serve as a handmaiden to the Christian\nfaith. Bruno denied any such notions of progress. Human knowledge,\nlike all natural things, observed the rule of vicissitude (see\n Section 3),\ngradually oscillating from one extreme to the other. Greek philosophy\nfrom Plato onwards was a debased version of the true wisdom known to\nancient sages such as Hermes Trismegistus among the Egyptians and\nPythagoras, Parmenides and Empedocles among the early Greeks. The\ntask, then, was to restore an authentic ancient philosophy by\nelaborating upon what could be discerned in the few surviving Egyptian\nand Pythagorean records of it with the help of vestigial truths\npreserved in Greek philosophy. Even Aristotle, \u201cthe stupidest of\nall philosophers\u201d, who had done his best to \u201cpervert the\nopinions of the ancients and oppose the truth\u201d (BOI I, 182,\n730), sometimes included, despite himself, valuable ideas gleaned from\nhis predecessors. The many other philosophical sources that Bruno\neclectically pressed into service\u2014Presocratic, Platonic,\nAristotelian, Stoic, Epicurean, medieval, Arabic, scholastic and\nRenaissance\u2014had the same purpose: the articulation of a\nphilosophy true to the principles of an ancient wisdom all but\nobliterated by Aristotle and his followers.\n\nHis approach towards Scripture followed suit. Patristic, medieval and\nRenaissance authors, including again Ficino, held that Hermes\nTrismegistus had lived at the same time as or shortly after Moses.\nThis explained the many similarities between the Old Testament and\nHermes\u2019s writings. Bruno reversed the chronology. He was not the\nfirst Renaissance author to do so, but he was the first to draw out\nthe implications. The daughter of the Pharaoh had taken Moses into her\nhousehold as \u201cher son\u201d (Exodus 2:10, KJV), and he had\nbecome \u201clearned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians\u201d (Acts\n7:22, KJV; BOI II, 369). This \u201cwisdom of the Egyptians\u201d\nwas the wisdom recorded in Hermes\u2019s works. In other words, the\nPentateuch, which conventionally was believed to have been composed by\nMoses, and hence Scripture as a whole were tributaries of Egyptian\nlore, rather than vice versa. Bruno made this point circumspectly, as\nwell he might. Sometimes he disguised his interpretation by referring\nto Scripture as the \u201cKabbalah\u201d. Such wisdom, he declared,\nas there was in the Kabbalah of the Jews \u201cderived from the\nEgyptians, by whom Moses was educated\u201d (BOI II, 362; 369).\nRead literally, this statement was uncontroversial. Though purportedly\nMosaic in origin, the Kabbalah was not an authoritative repository of\nChristian doctrine. By \u201cKabbalah\u201d, however, Bruno\nsurreptitiously meant Jewish lore as recorded not only in the\noriginally oral tradition of the Kabbalah, but also in the parallel\nwritten tradition, that is, the Pentateuch, and hence in the Old and\nNew Testaments generally. The crucifixion was a \u201cKabbalistic\ntragedy\u201d (BOI II, 263).\n\nTravesty though it therefore was for the most part, Holy Scripture,\nlike Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s philosophies, had inherited\nsome truths from pre-Mosaic wisdom. Bruno duly quoted from Scripture\non many occasions\u2014examples feature in the following\nsections\u2014to support his metaphysical, cosmological and ethical\nideas. The Book of Job was especially valuable in this respect. Job\nhad lived in the Land of Uz and so recorded, not Jewish lore, but\n\u201cprofound mysteries of the Chaldeans\u201d (BOL I.2, 390, 418),\nones that, like the wisdom of the Egyptians, the Magi, Orphics and\nPythagoreans, constituted a strand of \u201cthe ancient\nphilosophy\u201d (BOI I, 460). Chaldean wisdom, like that of the\nEgyptians, owed nothing of importance to the \u201cJewish\nKabbala\u201d, which had been composed by a people, the\n\u201cexcrement\u201d of Egypt, who had never governed a land\nof their own (BOI II, 377). Whether these and other aspersions \n(see also BOI II, 438, and\n Section 7), \nstereotypical by his day, represent prejudices discredited by\nobjections voiced by other interlocutors or ones that he shared is a\nmoot point. One way or the other they served to convey his conviction\nthat what truths there were in scripture derived from a philosophical\ntradition that had originated in ancient Egypt.\n\nMedieval and Renaissance philosophers and theologians had,\ndisastrously, held the opposite view. Philosophically, they looked to\nPlato, Aristotle and Averroes as authorities, rather than to Hermes,\nthe Chaldeans, Pythagoras and other early Greek sages. Exegetes had\nconsequently misinterpreted those parts of Scripture that touched on\nphilosophical matters, incorrectly reading literally passages that\ndescribed nature and the universe figuratively and vice versa.\nThis did not dissuade Bruno from adopting scholastic ideas when it suited his\npurposes. He acknowledged the Dominican Thomas Aquinas as an important\ninfluence, praised the metaphysical speculations of thirteenth-century\nOxford Franciscans (e.g., Duns Scotus) and extolled Averroes as a\nbetter commentator on Aristotle than any late Greek commentator,\ndespite the Arab philosopher\u2019s ignorance of the Greek language.\nIt was contemporary scholasticism that bore the brunt of Bruno\u2019s\nanimosity, above all for its emphasis on Latin style at the expense of\nintellectual substance\u2014a vice contracted from Renaissance\nhumanism, for which he had no patience.\n",
