Mechanistic dependence might\nbe distinguished from a mereological relation, if mechanisms are not\nthe sorts of things that have parts in the ordinary sense of the term\nas some have claimed (Craver 2005). On one reading, the entity\nexplained in a mechanistic explanation is an event. A mechanistic\nexplanation explains an event in terms of events that together form\nthe event to be explained. On this view, mechanistic dependence is\nanalogous to mereological dependence but not the same, and might thus\ncomplement the mereological approach to yield a fully-fledged\ncharacterization of reduction.\n",
