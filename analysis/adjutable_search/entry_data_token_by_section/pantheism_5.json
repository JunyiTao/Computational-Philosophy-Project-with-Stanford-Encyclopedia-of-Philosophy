The nature of the cosmos\n\nBesides commitment to the view that the cosmos as a whole is divine,\npantheists as a general class hold no specific theory about the\nnature of that cosmos. There are three main traditions.\n\n(1) Physicalism. Many pantheists argue that physical\nconceptions are adequate to explain the entire cosmos. This is an\nancient form of pantheism, found for example in the Stoics, for whom\nonly bodies can be said to exist. Soul they understood as nothing more\nthan a specific form of pneuma, or breath, the active power\nto be found throughout nature. This is also a form of pantheism\npopular today\u2014often termed, scientific or naturalistic\npantheism. Such worldviews make no ontological commitments beyond\nthose sanctioned by empirical science (Buckareff 2016,\nLancaster-Thomas 2020).\n\n(2) Idealism. During the nineteenth century, when pantheism\nwas at its most popular, the dominant form was idealist. According to\nAbsolute Idealism, as defended by such figures as Fichte, Schelling,\nHegel, and many of the British Idealists, all that exists is a single\nspiritual entity, of which the physical world must be understood as a\npartial manifestation. The search for that which may be asserted\nwithout condition or qualification leads to the conclusion that all\nvariety is the expression of an underlying unity, and that nothing can\nbe real in the absence of mind or spirit. On some versions of this\nsort of doctrine the physical world starts to look more like an\nappearance of the ultimate spiritual (or possibly unknown)\nreality beneath. Hegel himself rejects this sort of doctrine\n\u2014which he terms acosmism\u2014and while it certainly\namounts to a view that there exists nothing besides God, in view of\nits basic denial of the reality of the world we all experience it\nhardly seems like a kind of pantheism.\n\n(3) Dual-aspect theory. The pantheism of Spinoza is of\nneither these types. For Spinoza, there is one thing which expresses\nitself, or which may be understood, in two different ways, either as\nthinking substance or as extended substance. The principle difficulty\nof any such position is to further specify that ambiguous\nrelationship, whilst simultaneously avoiding the twin but opposed\npitfalls of reductionism and dualism.\n\nPantheists holds that whatever exists falls within God. This places\nthem in disagreement with any theory of the supernatural. But\nsuch opposition must not be misunderstood, for to say that there is no\nsupernatural realm is not in itself to delineate the range of what is\nnatural. This is important, for while many contemporary pantheists\nhave been epistemologically conservative, there is no reason in\nprinciple why the pantheist should oppose the idea of that which\nis epistemically transcendent to us, no reason (that is) why he should\nseek to limit the compass of the universe to the known\nuniverse. For example, Spinoza held, not only that the realms of\nthought and extension must stretch indefinitely beyond our finite\ngrasp, but that, as well as in the two known realms of thought and\nextension, the one substance must exist also in an infinity of other\ndimensions completely beyond our power to conceive.\n",
