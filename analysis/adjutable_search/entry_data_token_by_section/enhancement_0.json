    "main_text": "Introduction || Terminology\n1.1 Terminology\nAs our preface suggests, the ordinary use of the phrase \u201chuman\nenhancement\u201d covers a wide range of practices, most of which are\nnot explored in the enhancement ethics literature. To orient our\ntour, both \u201chuman\u201d and \u201cenhancement\u201d merit some\ninitial clarification, even before we pursue the ways they are\ninterpreted and debated in the literature. For example, as\nsection 2.3 below shows, equivocations between biological and\nevaluative senses of the term \u201chuman\u201d are rich sources of\nmany superficial disagreements in these debates. Is there anything\nspecial about being a member of the biological species homo\nsapiens that enhancements could threaten, or are those who\ncriticize enhancement as \u201cdehumanizing\u201d really thinking\nabout the loss of other markers of the moral status we confer on\npersons? To look ahead, we think it will become clear in the sections\nbelow that the ethical issues at the heart of the debate about human\nenhancement are not about policing the biological boundaries of the\nspecies homo sapiens. At this point, however, it is enough to\nnote that we are foreclosing neither sense of \u201chuman\u201d from\nthe start, but will stay alert to both until it becomes important to\ndistinguish and relate them.\nWith \u201cenhancement\u201d, on the other hand, it is helpful to\nspecify a working definition from the start. We understand the\npractices that are being debated in the enhancement ethics literature\nto be biomedical interventions that are used to improve human form\nor functioning beyond what is necessary to restore or sustain\nhealth. This broad definition flows from and reflects the\nfoundational literature in this area (Parens 1998), but it also has\nseveral implications that are sometimes forgotten.\nFirst, it means that simple line-drawing exercises aimed at\nisolating \u201cenhancement technologies\u201d from other biomedical\ninterventions for special precautionary regulation or oversight are\ndestined to be ineffective (pace Anderson 1989). There\nare no \u201cenhancement technologies\u201d per se. Whether\na given biomedical intervention counts as an enhancement depends on how\nit is used. When ankle-strengthening surgery is used to improve a\nbicyclist\u2019s competitive edge, it might raise enhancement\nconcerns, but as a treatment for a bicyclist\u2019s ankle injury, it\ndoes not. This means that the developers of even the most outr\u00e9\nenhancement interventions will almost always be able to appeal to some\ncorrelative therapeutic uses to justify their research, testing, and\nrelease into the market (Mehlman 1999). On the other hand, simply\npointing out that biomedical technologies can have both therapeutic and\nenhancement uses does nothing to collapse the logical distinction\nbetween those uses, or to defeat the claim that those distinguishable\nuses might warrant different ethical responses (Buchanan 2011).\nSecond, the definition of \u201cenhancement\u201d used in this\nentry restricts the term to biomedical interventions, even though\nother methods of increasing normal human capacities raise ethical\nissues as well. Electronic and robotic tools that enable us to listen,\nobserve, help or harm at a distance, lifestyles designed to maximize\nparticular talents, and social practices that foster new forms of\nhuman relationship all come with their own trade-offs and moral\nconcerns. But the focus of the enhancement ethics literature is\noverwhelmingly on interventions that make biological changes in human\nbodies and brains, using pharmaceutical, surgical, or genetic\ntechniques (Clarke, Savulescu, Coady, et. al., 2016). Standard examples\ninclude:\n\ncosmetic surgery and the use of biosynthetic growth hormone to\nincrease stature (Miller, Brody and Chung, 2000; Little, 1998; White,\n1993; Conrad and Potter, 2004),\n\u201cblood doping\u201d and steroid use to improve athletic\nendurance and strength (Miah 2004; Murray 2009; Tolleneer, 2013),\npsychopharmaceutical approaches to increasing memory, elevating\nmood, and improving cognitive capacities (Elliott 1998; Whitehouse,\net. al., 1997; Sandberg 2011; Glannon 2008; Levy, Douglas, Kahane,\net. al. 2014a; Duncan 2016; Earp 2018), and\npotential genetic and neurological manipulations to increase the\nhuman life span, acquire new sensory-motor abilities, and, through\n\u201cmoral enhancement\u201d, live together in more peaceable,\ngenerous, and just ways (cf. Savulescu, ter Meulen and Kahane 2011;\nHarris 2016; Wiseman 2016; Johnson, Bishop and Toner 2019).\n\nOf course, the line between biomedical and other enhancements is\noften blurry. Caffeine is a drug that can heighten alertness, but\ncoffee drinking is a social practice outside the biomedical sphere.\nMeditation and prayer can have the same physiological effects as\ndrugs.  The \u201ccyborgs\u201d of science fiction blend human\nbodies with electronic and mechanical tools (Hughes 2004). The\nprospect of uploading minds into computers to create bodiless human\nlife is sometimes characterized as \u201cradical enhancement\u201d\n(Agar 2013). But as important and intriguing as these mixed cases are\nfrom ethical and conceptual perspectives (Hogle 2005), this essay will\nonly engage them in two ways. The first is when they help advance our\nunderstanding of core issues raised by the enhancement uses of the\nemerging biomedical technologies. The second is when, inevitably, our\ndiscussion of biomedical enhancements uncovers insights that reflect\nback upon the ethical dimensions of these other practices.\nFinally, our definition implies that enhancement interventions\nattempt to improve specific human capacities and traits, rather than\nwhole persons. Unlike such comprehensive personal-improvement\nstrategies such as prayer, psychoanalysis, or \u201cthe power of\npositive thinking\u201d, biomedical enhancements are, at best, a\npiecemeal approach to human perfectibility. As a result, most\nbiomedical enhancements involve trade-offs.  If extended life span comes\nwith prolonged frailty, or if enhanced altruism compromises survival\nskills, the overall value of the enhancement can be called into\nquestion (Shickle 2000).\n",
