    "main_text": "Special Topics in the Study of Animal Consciousness || Animal emotions\n7.2 Animal emotions\n\n\nThe idea of animal emotions is, of course, prominent in Darwin\u2019s work\nwith his 1872 book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and\nAnimals.  Willingness to see animals as emotional beings (and\nhumans, by contrast, as endowed with rationality that can override the\nemotions) goes back at least to Ancient Greek philosophy. Konrad\nLorenz seems to have held a similar view, echoing Oskar Heinroth\u2019s\nstatement that \u201canimals are highly emotional people of very\nlimited intelligence\u201d (Lorenz 1971b, 334). These days it is more\nfashionable to regard emotions as an important component of\nintelligence.  Regardless of the merits of that view, the scientific\nstudy of animal emotions has gained its own momentum.  Early in the\n20th century, although they are not arguing for or about animal\nconsciousness, physiologists recognized that significance of emotion\nin animal behavior. Dror (1999) explains how the emotional state of\nanimals was considered to be a source of noise in physiological\nexperiments at that time, and researchers took steps to ensure that\nanimals were calm before their experiments.  According to Dror,\nalthough physiologists were forced to deal with the problem of\nemotional noise, attempts to treat emotion as a subject of study in\nits own right never crystallized to the extent of generating a journal\nor other institutional features (Dror 1999, 219).\n More recently, Jaak Panksepp (2004, 2005) has been conducting a\nresearch program that he calls \u201caffective neuroscience\u201d\nand that encompasses direct study of animal emotions (2004),\nexemplified for example in the experimental investigation of rats\n\u201claughing\u201d and seeking further contact in response to\ntickling by humans (Panksepp & Burgdorf 2003). Over several\ndecades, his work (reviewed in Panksepp 2005) has elucidated the\nneuro- and molecular-physiological bases of several \u2018core\nemotional systems\u2019 including \u2018seeking\u2019,\n\u2018fear\u2019, \u2018rage\u2019, \u2018lust\u2019,\n\u2018care\u2019, \u2018play\u2019, and\n\u2018panic\u2019. Panksepp argues that these are shared by all\nmammals, and may be more widely shared among vertebrates. \n\nSufka et al. (2009) have proposed that animal models of\nneuropsychiatric disorders may also support the experimental\ninvestigation of animal emotions. Although depending on a more\nanecdotal, non-experimental approach, Smuts (2001) and Bekoff (2007)\neach defend the attribution of conscious emotions to animals from a\nscientist\u2019s perspective. Bekoff has made much of play behavior as an\nindicator of animal emotions, an idea that is also taken up by Cabanac\net al. (2009). \n\n\nEmpathy in animals is also a topic of current investigation (e.g.,\nPreston & de Waal 2002). Langford et al. (2002) argue for\nempathy in mice based on experiments in mice who observe a cagemate\ngiven a noxious stimulus, or in pain, are more sensitive to painful\nstimuli than control mice who observe an unfamiliar mouse similarly\ntreated. Byrne et al. (2008) argue for empathy in elephants\nas an inference to the best explanation of various capacities, such as\ndiagnosing animacy and goal directedness, and assessing the physical\nabilities and emotional states of other elephants when these different\nfrom their own.\n It is worth noting that almost all of the work, both theoretical\nand empirical, on animal emotions has limited its scope to mammals, or\nat least amniotes (For a notable recent exception, see Mendl et\nal. 2011). This work has exploited certain deep homologies of,\ne.g. brain structure and molecular neurophysiology (focusing\nespecially on hormones and neurotransmitters) in making arguments that\nanimals in these taxanomic groups share our emotions because they\nshare the mechanisms of our own emotions (as well as behaviors that\ntend to indicate emotions in us, and bear the same relations to the\nunderlying physiological mechanisms). This approach is not available\nto animals which are very distantly related to us,\ni.e. invertebrates. The ancestors of vertebrates split off from the\nrest of the animal phyla at a time when all animals were still\nrelatively simple, in terms of structure, tissue types, number of\nneurons, bodily capacities for locomotion and other forms of\nbehavior. The elaboration of complex physiological systems occurred\nindependently in the various phyla. Therefore the physiological\nsystems underlying emotions in other phyla \u2014 if these exist\n\u2014 may be very different, and hence difficult to identify, either\nin terms of direct physiological observations or in terms of\nobservations of behavioral expressions of emotion. It is also possible\nthat the repertoire of emotions in other phyla might be different,\nfurther problematizing the task of individuating non-vertebrate\nemotions. (Further discussion and additional scientific references for\nthe topic of emotions and empathy in animals can be found in the\n section on emotions and empathy in the entry on \n animal cognition.)\n",
