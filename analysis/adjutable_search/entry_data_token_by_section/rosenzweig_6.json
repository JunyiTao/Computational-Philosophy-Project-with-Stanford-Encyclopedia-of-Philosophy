    "main_text": "Personal and Intellectual Development || Revelation and \u201cAtheistic Theology\u201d\n1.6 Revelation and \u201cAtheistic Theology\u201d\n\n\nIn 1914, already under Cohen\u2019s influence and unmoved by the\nromantic theology of Martin Buber popular at the time, Rosenzweig wrote\nhis first essay in Jewish theology, \u201cAtheistic Theology.\u201d\nThe article criticized as atheistic those tendencies of contemporary\nJewish theology, Buber\u2019s foremost among them, to conceive of the\nidea of God as an expression of the vital Jewish aspiration for unity.\nSuch theology, Rosenzweig argued, reduced the divine to no more than a\nhuman projection. In lieu of such contemporary trends, Rosenzweig\ninsists that theology in his time cannot avoid taking seriously the\nnotion of revelation: the notion that God, transcendent to and\nindependent of the human being in the world, at once enters into\nrelation with the human being in the world. Indeed, Rosenzweig claims\nhere that only by taking the transcendence and at once the revelation\nof God seriously\u2014rather than reducing the divine to an\nexpression of a Jewish life force\u2014can we grasp the split the\nhuman being experiences in history, between his personal\nself-realization and the realization of the world. It is the notion of\nrevelation, Rosenzweig suggests, that allows us to view history along\nan absolute redemptive trajectory, established by God\u2019s relation\nto the human being in the world. Such a notion of revelation would\nreappear at the center of Rosenzweig\u2019s systematic work, The\nStar of Redemption, a few years later. \n",
