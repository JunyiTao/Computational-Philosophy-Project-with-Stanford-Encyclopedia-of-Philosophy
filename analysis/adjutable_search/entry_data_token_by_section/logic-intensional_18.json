    "main_text": "Sense as Algorithm || Sense\n4.4 Sense\nEach formula of LPCR specifies an algorithm for its evaluation,\nthat is, for the determination of its truth value (if\npossible). Moschovakis identifies the sense of a formula with\nthat algorithm. Two formulas that evaluate to the same result, thus\nhaving the same denotation, may have different senses because the\nassociated algorithms are different. For example, in \\eqref{evenone} we\ngave a formula that defines the even numbers. Here is another such\nformula. \n\n\\[\\tag{25}\\label{eventwo}\n\\even(x) \\equiv E(x) \\textsf{ where } \\{ E(x) \\simeq x=0 \\lor (\\exists y)(S(y,x)\\land \\lnot E(y))\\}\\] \n\nWe leave it to you to verify that \\eqref{eventwo} also defines the even\nnumbers. It is intuitively plausible that \\eqref{evenone} and \\eqref{eventwo}\nevaluate using algorithms that differ, and so have different\nsenses. But of course this must be made precise. What is needed is a\nuniform method of comparison between algorithms. Here we just briefly\nsketch the ideas.\nThere is very general machinery, from Moschovakis 1989, called the\nFormal Language of Recursion, FLR. Using it a thorough exploration of\nrecursive definitions and fixpoints is possible. The language that\nconcerns us here, LPCR, embeds into FLR, even allowing nested clauses\nand parameters, something we ignored in our discussion of\ndenotation. In FLR there is a method for converting recursive\ndefinitions into a normal form, which cannot be further reduced. That\nnormal form has a very simple structure, consisting of a set of\nself-referential equations with no nesting present at all. Normal\nforms reveal essential evaluation structure most clearly. When working\nwith a single structure, \\(\\langle\\bD, \\bR_1, \\ldots,\n\\bR_n\\rangle\\), all normal forms will be built from a common\nset of functionals. This makes it easy to compare normal forms. The\nidea is that if two formulas of LPCR, when embedded into FLR, have\ndiffering normal forms, the two formulas have different senses. Of\ncourse this must be taken with some reasonable flexibility. For\ninstance, two sets of equations that differ only by renaming variables\nor switching order of equations do not differ in any fundamental\nway. With this understood, if two LPCR formulas, when embedded into\nFLR, have truly distinct normal forms, the two LPCR formulas are\ndefined to have different senses. This meets all the informal\nconditions one wants a notion of sense to have. Moschovakis even\nproves the important theorem that equality of sense, as just defined,\nis decidable under natural conditions.\n",
