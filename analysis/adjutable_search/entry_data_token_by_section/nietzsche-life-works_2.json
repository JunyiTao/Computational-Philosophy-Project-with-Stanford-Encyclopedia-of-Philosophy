    "main_text": "Middle-Period Writings: 1878\u20131882\n3. Middle-Period Writings: 1878\u20131882\n\nNietzsche completed Human, All-Too-Human in 1878,\nsupplementing this with a second part in 1879, Mixed Opinions and\nMaxims (Vermischte Meinungen und Spr\u00fcche), and a\nthird part in 1880, The Wanderer and his Shadow (Der\nWanderer und sein Schatten). The three parts were published\ntogether in 1886 as Human All-Too-Human, A Book for Free\nSpirits (Menschliches, Allzumenschliches, Ein Buch f\u00fcr\nfreie Geister). Reluctant to construct a philosophical\n\u201csystem,\u201d and sensitive to the importance of style in\nphilosophic writing, Nietzsche composed these works as a series of\nseveral hundred short passages and aphorisms\u2014concise\ncondensations of his assorted insights\u2014whose typical length\nranges from a line or two to a page or two. Here, he often reflects\nupon cultural and psychological phenomena by connecting them to\nindividuals\u2019 organic and physiological constitutions. The idea\nof power (for which he would later become known) sporadically appears\nas an explanatory principle, but he tends at this time to invoke\nhedonistic considerations of pleasure and pain in his explanations of\ncultural and psychological phenomena. Given his harsh criticisms of\nhedonism and utilitarianism in later works (e.g., Thus Spoke\nZarathustra, re: \u201cthe Last Man\u201d), Human\nAll-Too-Human appears to many readers as an uncharacteristic\nwork, more science- than art-inspired in its approach to health, where\nNietzsche was struggling to break free of Wagner\u2019s spell, and\nwhich, presupposing a fundamentally hedonistic moral psychology, does\nnot fully embody the pain-and-power-centered approach that he later\ndeveloped.\n\nIn Daybreak: Reflections on Moral Prejudices\n(Morgenr\u00f6te. Gedanken \u00fcber die moralischen\nVorurteile, 1881), Nietzsche continues writing in his aphoristic\nstyle, but he marks a new beginning by accentuating as opposed to\npleasure, the importance of the \u201cfeeling of power\u201d in his\nunderstanding of human, and especially of so-called\n\u201cmoral\u201d behavior. Always having been interested in the\nnature of health, his emerging references to power stem from his\nearlier efforts to discover the secret of the ancient Greeks\u2019\noutstanding health, which he had regarded as the effects of how\n\u201cagon\u201d (i.e., competition, one-upmanship, or\ncontest, as conceived in his 1872 essay, \u201cHomer\u2019s\nContest\u201d) permeated their cultural attitudes. In this respect,\nDaybreak contains the seeds of Nietzsche\u2019s doctrine of\nthe \u201cwill to power\u201d\u2014a doctrine that appears\nexplicitly for the first time two years later in Thus Spoke\nZarathustra (1883\u201385). Daybreak is also one of\nNietzsche\u2019s clearest, intellectually calmest, and most intimate,\nvolumes, providing many social-psychological insights in conjunction\nwith some of his first sustained critical reflections on the cultural\nrelativity at the basis of Christian moral evaluations. In this\nbook\u2014as he remarks retrospectively in Ecce Homo\n(1888)\u2014Nietzsche begins his \u201ccrusade [Feldzug]\nagainst morality.\u201d\n\nIn a more well-known aphoristic work, The Gay Science\n(Die fr\u00f6hliche Wissenschaft, 1882)\u2014whose title was\ninspired by the troubadour songs of southern-French Provence\n(1100\u20131300)\u2014Nietzsche sets forth some of the existential\nideas for which he became famous, namely, the proclamation that\n\u201cGod is dead\u201d and the doctrine of eternal\nrecurrence\u2014a doctrine that attends to how people of different\nlevels of health are likely to react to the prospect of being reborn,\nover and over again, to replay life\u2019s experience exactly as\nbefore in every pleasurable and painful sequence of detail.\nNietzsche\u2019s atheism\u2014his account of \u201cGod\u2019s\nmurder\u201d (section 125)\u2014expresses in a literary manner, his\nphilosophical condemnation of all absolute perspectives and values.\nHis atheism also aims to redirect people\u2019s attention to their\ninherent freedom, the presently-existing world, and away from\nescapist, pain-relieving, heavenly otherworlds.\n\nTo a similar end, Nietzsche\u2019s doctrine of eternal recurrence\n(sections 285 and 341) serves to draw attention away from all worlds\nother than the one in which we presently live, since eternal\nrecurrence precludes the possibility of any final escape from the\npresent world. The doctrine also functions as a measure for judging\nsomeone\u2019s overall psychological strength and mental health,\nsince Nietzsche believed that the doctrine of eternal recurrence was\nthe hardest world-view to affirm. There are some differences of\nscholarly opinion concerning whether Nietzsche primarily intends this\ndoctrine to describe a serious metaphysical theory, or whether he is\noffering merely one way to interpret the world among many others,\nwhich if adopted therapeutically as a psychologically healthy myth,\ncan help us become stronger.\n\nIn 1887, The Gay Science was reissued with an important\npreface, an additional fifth Book, and an appendix of songs,\nreminiscent of the troubadours.\n",
