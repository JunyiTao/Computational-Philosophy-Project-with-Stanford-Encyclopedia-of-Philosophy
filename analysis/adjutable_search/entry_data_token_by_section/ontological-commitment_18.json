    "main_text": "Carnap and Neo-Carnapianism || Carnap\n6.1 Carnap\nCarnap was a deflationist about traditional ontological disputes,\nsuch as whether numbers exist, or physical objects exist. He held that\nexistence questions could be interpreted in two different ways,\ninternally or externally. When interpreted internally, the question\nwas to be answered relative to a linguistic framework.  If the\nframework was mathematical, existence questions, such as whether there\nare prime numbers greater than 1000, were to be answered by means of\nproof, given the axioms and rules of logic introduced by the\nframework. If the framework was empirical, existence questions, such\nas whether electrons exist, were to be answered through observation\naccording to the rules of confirmation and disconfirmation introduced\nby the framework. When the existence questions involved the most\ngeneral kinds introduced by the framework, the answers were\ntrivial. In the framework of numbers, it is trivial that numbers\nexist; in the framework of physical objects, it is trivial that\nphysical objects exist. For it is stipulated in introducing these\nframeworks that the variables range over numbers, or physical\nobjects.\nWhen existence questions are interpreted externally, they purport\nto be about \u201creality\u201d independent of any particular\nlinguistic framework. So interpreted, according to Carnap, these\nquestions\u2014such as \u201cdo numbers exist?\u201d or \u201cdo\nphysical objects exist?\u201d\u2014are pseudo-questions lacking any\ncognitive meaning. Since metaphysicians engaging in ontological\ndisputes over these questions evidently have the external\ninterpretation in mind\u2014they do not take them to be\ntrivial\u2014much of traditional metaphysics for Carnap was\ncognitively meaningless as well. The best one can do to make sense of\nexternal existence questions is to re-construe them as pragmatic\nquestions as to which frameworks to accept. The question, \u201cdo\nnumbers exist\u201d, for example, could be re-construed as the\nquestion, \u201cis it useful to introduce the number\nframework\u201d. A framework could be deemed useful, for example, if\nit facilitated factual communication in ways that were\n\u201cefficient, fruitful, and simple\u201d (Carnap 1950).\nOne might wonder whether it is coherent to interpret all meaningful\nexistence questions as internal: don't we need the concept of\nexistence to introduce and meaningfully discuss the frameworks\nthemselves, and their pragmatic virtues? Can it be frameworks\n\u201call the way down\u201d? But, for purposes of this article, it\nsuffices to ask how the notion of ontological commitment fits in to\nCarnap's scheme. One might expect Carnap to tie talk of ontological\ncommitment to external questions, and reject it accordingly: if it is\ncognitively meaningless to say that Ks exist in\nreality, then it is cognitively meaningless to say that a theory\npresupposes or assumes that Ks exist in reality.  But that\nis not what Carnap did. Rather, he endorsed Quine's quantifier\naccount of ontological commitment, applying it internally; his only\nreservation had to do with Quine's use of the word\n\u2018ontological\u2019.[48] \nFor Carnap, a theory always comes\npackaged with a linguistic framework for interpreting the theory. To\nsay that a theory is ontologically committed to Ks, then, is\njust to say that according to the rules of the framework-cum-theory,\nit is true that Ks exist. A philosopher can be said to\n\u201caccept a kind of entities\u201d when he introduces a\nlinguistic framework that, first, introduces a general term satisfied\nby all and only entities of that kind and, second, introduces\nvariables to range over all and only those entities (see Carnap 1950:\n213).\nHow do Carnap's views relate to Quine's? First, it might well be\nasked, which of the quantifier accounts canvassed above is Carnap\nendorsing when he claims to be in agreement with Quine?  Since Carnap\nclearly allows a philosopher who has not accepted (for\npragmatic reasons) some kind of entity to attribute acceptance of that\nkind to another philosopher, Carnap's view would appear to be closest\nto the metalinguistic version of Quine's quantifier account. We are\nmaking claims about linguistic frameworks, and what follows from the\nrules of those frameworks; and these claims, at least for Carnap, do\nnot make problematic assertions about \u201creality\u201d. Second, a\nconsequence of Carnap's view is that theories with different\nontological commitments should not be thought of as conflicting. This\ncontrasts sharply with Quine. Because Quine has a single, all-purpose\nlogico-linguistic framework\u2014austere first-order predicate\nlogic\u2014within which all theories are couched for purposes of\nexamining their ontological commitments, theories with differing\nexistential presuppositions genuinely conflict; a philosopher must\nchoose which theory to accept. For Carnap, theories with differing\nontological commitments are ipso facto couched within\ndifferent linguistic frameworks. If there is disagreement, it can only\nbe over the relative pragmatic virtues of the frameworks in\nquestion. In this way, Carnap's deflationary approach to ontology\ncarries with it a deflationary approach to ontological\ncommitment. Carnap is a pluralist; a philosopher can choose\nto accept multiple theories, with differing ontological commitments,\nwithout pain of contradiction. Let many flowers bloom (see Carnap\n1950: 221).\n",
