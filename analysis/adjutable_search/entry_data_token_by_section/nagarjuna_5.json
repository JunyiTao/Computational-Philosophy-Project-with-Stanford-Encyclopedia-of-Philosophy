    "main_text": "Arguments against svabh\u0101va || Personal identity\n3.3 Personal identity\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s criticism of substance does not just apply\nto the world of objects, to the phenomena around us, but equally to\nthe world of subjects, that is our own and other persons\u2019 self.\nThis is very much in harmony with the Buddha\u2019s own conception of\na person that rejected a self existing with svabh\u0101va.\nSuch a self would have to be conceived of as distinct from both our\nbody and our psychological states, as essentially unchanging, as a\nunifier of our diverse beliefs, desires and sensory impressions, and\nas an agent that makes the decisions that shape our lives. The\nalternative presented by the Buddha is a view of the self that regards\nit as a continuously changing array of five psycho-physical aggregates\n(the physical body, sensation, perception, intellect, and\nconsciousness) without an inner core. Many of the arguments\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna presents when rejecting the notion of a\nsubstantially existent subject bear a close resemblance to those\nbrought forward by the Buddha himself. (See the entry on\n Buddha.) \n Nevertheless his works also provide\nus with some arguments with a distinctly N\u0101g\u0101rjunian\nslant. In MMK 18:2a the opponent wonders: \u2018if there was no self,\nwhere would the self\u2019s properties come from?\u2019 The worry\nbehind this question is that the undeniable fact that there are\nproperties of the self\u2014since the Madhyamaka does not want to\ndeny that seeing, feeling, tasting and so forth takes place \u2014\nimplies that there must be a bearer of such properties, i.e. a\nself. Since properties depend existentially on something that\ninstantiates them a self must be postulated as the instantiator of all\nthe mental properties we observe. It appears as if we need a\nsubstratum for the psychological states, desires, beliefs and so\non. However, the body, because of its continuously changing nature,\ncannot be regarded as adequate for such substratumhood.  Therefore\nsome kind of self has to be postulated.\n\nBut if we take into account the distinction between constitutive and\ninstantiated properties described above it seems possible to dissolve\nthis worry. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna differentiates between the property we\nsee as constituting an individual (such as roundness in the case of a\ncircle, treeness in the case of a tree etc.) and those properties that\nthe individual is then taken to instantiate (such as redness in the\ncase of the circle, and greenness in the case of the tree). As became\nevident in the discussion of motion where N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\nintroduces this distinction, the difference between constitutive and\ninstantiated properties is not regarded as bearing any ontological\nweight. It is rather a reflection of our epistemic priorities and\npractical concerns that we describe an object as a tree which is\ngreen, rather that as a green object which has the property of\ntreeness. As a consequence there is no fundamental ontological\ndifference between a substratum (dravya) and the qualities\n(gu\u1e47a) that inhere in it, contrary to the view\nthat is e.g. held by the Naiy\u0101yikas. (See the entry on\n Analytic Philosophy in Early Modern India\n (Navya-Ny\u0101ya).) When we speak of an individual having a property\nwe nominalize the predicate expressing the property we take to be\nconstitutive and ascribe the instantiating properties to the\nindividual thus created. There is, however, no deep ontological reason\nwhy we could not change our view of what the constitutive and what the\ninstantiating properties are, and thereby describe the very same\nsituation in terms of different individuals and properties. But if we\naccept this picture of ontology it is evident that we are not obliged\nto infer the existence of a substratum or underlying individual from\nthe existence of a quality. Of course the M\u0101dhyamika does not\ndeny that there are a variety of sensory and mental events that happen\nin close temporal and causal connection. But our ascription of these\nto a single self does not commit us to the existence of such a self at\nthe ontological level, any more than the ascription of redness to a\ncircle commits us to the existence of an individual \u2014 the circle\n\u2014 and the redness it instantiates. In the same way in which we\nselect one property, such as circularity, as constitutive and then\ngroup all the other properties around this new-found\n\u2018individual\u2019, in the same way we select certain properties\nof a causal nexus of sensory and mental events, some \u2018shifting\ncoalition of psycho-physical elements\u2019 and group the remainder\nof the properties around this new-found \u2018self\u2019. To speak\nof the self and its properties in terms of substratum and quality is\nperfectly acceptable, as long as we do not assume that such talk is\nbased on a distinction with an ontological grounding.\n\nAnother issue N\u0101g\u0101rjuna raises (in MMK 9:3) concerns the\nepistemic status of the self. A tension arises once we note that in\nits role as a unifier of our cognitive life a substantial self\nfeatures in all our experiences, as the subject having the\nexperiences, but at the same time, given the distinctness of such a\nself from our body and all parts of our mental life it must also be\ndistinct from all experiences. In order to have epistemic access to\nour self it must be able to function as a cognitive object. Since we\nassume, however, that it is not only a cognitive subject but also\nintrinsically a cognitive object it cannot ever occupy this role\n\u2014 at least if we make the plausible assumption that being an\nobject and being a subject are mutually incompatible properties. Now\ngiven that we do not seem to be able to acquire knowledge of the self\nby introspection or by observation of the outside world it appears\nthat the only cognitive route left open to us is inference. We have to\nestablish by an argument that the self exists. It might strike us as\nslightly curious that what seems to be the most intimate object of our\nacquaintance has to be known by a most indirect route. We might also\nconsider it as somewhat epistemically implausible to assume that\neverybody\u2019s belief in a self is arrived at by a process of\ndrawing inferences from a set of clues. One Ny\u0101ya argument for\nthe existence of the self based on the supposed existential dependence\nof qualities on a substratum has already been discussed above. The\nM\u0101dhyamika will be reluctant to accept it since he does not agree\nwith the Ny\u0101ya ontology of individuals and properties it\npresupposes. Other arguments would obviously have to be dealt with on\na case-by-case basis. But the M\u0101dhyamika will argue here that in\nfact no such argument is needed, since it is perfectly possible to\naccount for our self-awareness, as long as we give up the conception\nof a substantial self. If we conceive of the self as a temporally\nstretched-out compound of psychophysical events then there is no\nfundamental difficulty that the same type of event turns up on the\ncognizing subject side on one occasion, and on the cognized object\nside on another. Given that there is no unified substratum\nconstituting the self there is also no necessity for something to be\nessentially a subject of experience. As different parts can play\ndifferent roles at different times our self-knowledge can be just\nexplained by a momentary identification with a mental event that\npresently functions as a cognizing subject.\n\nGiven that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna rejects the picture of a substantial\nself described above we have to consider which alternative picture we\nare presented with instead. The self is obviously seen as depending on\nthe five constituents, which rules out the assumption that any\nindependently existent substance could be regarded as a self. The\nemerging view of the self is characterized by two main properties.\n\nFirstly it is to be regarded as a sequence of events that stand in\nclose temporal and causal relations. Physical processes cause sensory\nevents, which are then framed by concepts, used as the basis of\ndecisions, which give rise to actions, which in turn set physical\nprocesses in motion which cause new sensory events and so forth. The\nself is not seen as a cognitive nucleus which stays constant amidst\nthe stream of changing sensory impressions and mental deliberations,\nbut rather as the entire set of such sensory and mental events which\nare interconnected in complicated ways.\n\nNot only does the self depend for its existence on the constituents,\nbut the constituents only acquire their existence as distinct parts of\nthe stream of mental and physical events by being associated with a\nsingle self, which, regarded as a constitutive property, produces the\nbasis for postulating the individual in which the various properties\nof the self inhere. It is precisely this reason that keeps the\nM\u0101dhyamika from regarding the constituents as ultimate existents\n(dravya) and the self as merely imputed\n(praj\u00f1apti). For the M\u0101dhyamika not only is there\nno substantial self, there is also no substantial basis on which a\nnon-substantial self could be built.\n\nSecondly, the self is characterized by a mistaken self-awareness. This\nmeans that the self which is essentially a sequence of events does not\nregard itself in this way, but considers itself to be a substantial\nself, that is, an essentially unchanging unified agent distinct from\nits physical and mental properties. To this extent it is deluded about\nits real nature. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna therefore compares the agent to\nan illusion created in a magical performance that in turn brings about\nanother illusion (MMK 17:31\u201332). This construction allows him to\nreconcile his rejection of a substantial self as an essentially\nunchanging unifier of our mental live distinct from both its physical\nand mental attributes with the acceptance of the self as an agent who\nwill experience the results of his actions, an assumption which could\nnot be relinquished within the Buddhist worldview. This is a very\nimportant point, since the identification of the self with a causally\ninterlinked set of events might tempt us to throw out all prudential\nconsiderations for our future selves, as well as those for other\nselves. Since none of these have any ultimate existence we might think\nthat all actions connected with them in some way (that is all our\nconscious actions) are all equally insubstantial too, so that in the\nultimate analysis it does not make any difference how we act.\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna counters this view by distinguishing the view from\nthe inside of an illusion from the outside view. When we are dreaming\nand are not aware we are doing so we understandably prefer to leave a\nbuilding by using the stairs, rather than jumping out of the window.\nFor somebody who is not dreaming, however (and also for our later,\nwaking selves) it does not make any difference whether we jump or not\nsince at the ultimate level (from the point of view of the awakened\none) there is no fundamental difference between the two actions. This\ndoes not imply that whilst we are still under the thrall of the\nillusion we should leave all prudential and moral considerations\nbehind. On the contrary, as long as we are under the influence of the\nillusion we have to act in accordance with its laws, even if we might\nsuspect that it is an illusion. Unlike in the case of dreaming, where\nthe mere wondering whether we are dreaming sometimes allows us to see\nthrough the nature of the dream the mere suspicion that there is no\nsubstantial self is (unfortunately) not yet a realization of the\nemptiness of the self.\n",
