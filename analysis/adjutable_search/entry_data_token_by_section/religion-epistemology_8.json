    "main_text": "Religious Experience, Revelation and Tradition\n9. Religious Disagreement\n\n\nReligious disagreement is a long-standing problem in philosophy of\nreligion, but in this century there has been great interest in\ndisagreements between theists and atheists as well as the\ndisagreements between followers of various religions. (See Kelly 2005,\nChristensen 2007, Feldman 2007, Kraft 2007, Feldman and Warfield 2011,\nChristensen and Lackey 2013) The problem here is obvious: how can\nsincere intelligent people disagree?  Should not both disputants\nsuspend judgement? To be sure, sometimes those who disagree with you\nare your intellectual inferiors in some respect. Consider, for\ninstance, someone who insisted that \u03c0 was precisely 22/7. Those who\nknow of and can follow a proof that \u03c0 is an irrational number may\njustifiably dismiss that person as a mathematical ignoramus.  The case\nof interest, however, is that in which no such inferiority is on\npublic display. This is referred to as a situation of public\nepistemic parity.  Richard Feldman criticizes the relativist\nsolution to the problem, namely that there is not always a unique\nreasonable doxastic attitude to a given proposition in a given\nepistemic situation. He also rejects unargued dismissal, and reaches\nthe conclusion that in situations of epistemic parity disputants\nshould suspend judgement. Many, however, agree with Peter van Inwagen\nwho, in his autobiographical \u2018Quam Delicta\u2019 (1994),\nimplies that it is justified for both parties in a dispute to appeal\nto what is privately available to them. Such private assertions of\nepistemic superiority are often expressed by saying that someone\n\u201cjust does not get the point\u201d. Typically, not getting the\npoint requires a cognitive blind-spot. It is not that you know there\nis a point you cannot grasp, which reasonably requires some deference\nto those who claim to grasp it.  You fail to see there is a point. A\nsomewhat different response to Feldman is that of Forrest (2019), who\nargues that when the cases for and against a thesis are of different\nkinds we may sometimes commit to the thesis, because\nnon-comparability is not the same as epistemic parity.\n\n\nOne obvious complication concerning religious disagreements is the\nappeal to divine inspiration, as a source of private epistemic\nsuperiority, as in Plantinga\u2019s \u201cAquinas/Calvin\u201d model\n(Plantinga 2000).  It is hard to see, though, how this could apply to\ndisputes between two religions that both rely on the role of divine\ninspiration. Perhaps the only substitute for unargued dismissal is\nargued dismissal. \n",
