    "main_text": "\n\nSometimes a series of choices do not serve one\u2019s concerns well\neven though each choice in the series seems perfectly well suited to\nserving one\u2019s concerns. In such cases, one has a dynamic choice\nproblem. Otherwise put, one has a problem related to the fact that\none\u2019s choices are spread out over time. There is a growing\nphilosophical literature, which crosses over into psychology and\neconomics, on the obstacles to effective dynamic choice. This\nliterature examines the challenging choice situations and problematic\npreference structures that can prompt dynamic choice problems. It also\nproposes solutions to such problems. Increasingly, familiar but\npotentially puzzling phenomena\u2014including, for example,\nself-destructive addictive behavior and dangerous environmental\ndestruction\u2014have been illuminated by dynamic choice theory. This\nsuggests that the philosophical and practical significance of dynamic\nchoice theory is quite broad.\n",
