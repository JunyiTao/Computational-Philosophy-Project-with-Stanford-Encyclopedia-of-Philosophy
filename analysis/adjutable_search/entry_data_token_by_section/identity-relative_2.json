    "main_text": "Paradoxes of Identity || The Paradox of Change\n2.1 The Paradox of Change\n\nThe most fundamental puzzle about identity is the problem of change.\nSuppose we have two photographs of a dog, Oscar. In one, \\(A\\), Oscar\nis a puppy, in the other, \\(B\\), he is old and gray-muzzled. Yet we\nhold that he is the same dog, in, it appears, direct violation of LL.\nMore explicitly, \\(B\\) is a photograph of an old dog with a gray\nmuzzle; \\(A\\) is a photograph of a young dog without a gray muzzle.\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are photographs of the same dog. But according to LL,\nif the dog in \\(B\\) has a property (e.g., having a gray muzzle) that\nthe dog in \\(A\\) lacks, then \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are not\nphotographs of the same dog. Contradiction.\n\nVarious solutions have been proposed. The most popular are the\nfollowing two: (1) Simple properties such as having or lacking a gray\nmuzzle are actually relations to times. Oscar has the property of\nlacking a gray muzzle at time t and the property of having a\ngray muzzle at (a later) \\(t'\\); but there is no incompatibility,\nsince being thus and so related to time \\(t\\) and not being thus and\nso related to time \\(t'\\) are compatible conditions, and hence change\ninvolves no violation of LL. (2) Oscar is an object that is extended\nin time as well as space. The puppy Oscar and old gray-muzzled Oscar\nare distinct temporal parts or stages of the whole temporally extended\nOscar. Both photographs are therefore not photographs of the whole\nOscar at all because there cannot be still photographs of Oscar.\n\nThese proposals may seem plausible, and indeed most philosophers\nsubscribe to one or other of them. The most common\nobjections\u2014that on the temporal parts account, objects are not\n\u201cwholly present\u201d at any given time, and that on the\nrelations-to-times account, seemingly simply properties of objects,\nsuch as Oscar having a gray muzzle, are complicated relations\u2014do\nlittle more than affirm what their targets deny. Yet the objections\nare an attempt to give voice to a strong intuition concerning our\nexperience as creatures existing in time. Both (1) and (2) treat time\nand change from a \u201cGod\u2019s eye\u201d point of view. (1)\npresupposes time laid out \u201call at once\u201d, so to speak, and\nsimilarly for (2). But we experience no such thing. Instead, while we\nare prepared to wait to see the whole of a baseball game we are\nwatching, we are not prepared to wait to see the whole of a painting\nwe are viewing.\n",
