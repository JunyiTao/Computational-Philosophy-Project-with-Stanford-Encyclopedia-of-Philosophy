    "main_text": "Varieties of Disjunctivism || Disjunctivism about Phenomenal Character\n2.3 Disjunctivism about Phenomenal Character\n\n\nSome disjunctivists claim that veridical perceptions have a phenomenal\ncharacter that hallucinations cannot possess. For example, according\nto one version of na\u00efve realism (what we might call\n\u2018na\u00efve realism about phenomenal character\u2019), when one\nveridically perceives the world, the mind-independent items perceived,\nsuch as tables and trees and the properties they manifest to one when\nperceived, partly constitute one\u2019s conscious experience, and\nhence determine its phenomenal character. This sort of na\u00efve\nrealist view is primarily motivated by phenomenological considerations.\nThe suggestion is that this view best articulates how sensory\nexperience seems to us to be through introspective reflection.\nAccording to those who propose this form of na\u00efve realism one\ncannot provide an adequate account of the phenomenal character of\nveridical perception by simply appealing to the idea that such\nexperience has an intentional content that represents the world as\nbeing a certain way, even if one holds that the intentional content in\nquestion is object-dependent; nor can one provide an adequate account\nof the phenomenal character of veridical perception by simply adding to\nthis the claim that experience possesses further non-representational\nproperties that it could possess independently of whether any\nmind-independent objects are being perceived. The na\u00efve realist\nabout phenomenal character instead claims that the right account of the\nphenomenal character of veridical perception should appeal to the idea\nthat such experience relates to the mind-independent items perceived in\na non-representational manner. (The motivations for this view are\ndiscussed in section 3.3).\n\n\nSince this na\u00efve realist account of phenomenal character cannot\nbe applied to hallucination, those who propose it are committed to the\nclaim that the kind of phenomenally conscious experience that occurs when\none veridically perceives the world does not occur when one is\nhallucinating. These na\u00efve realists can accept that veridical\nperceptions of numerically distinct objects can have the same\nphenomenal character, but they deny that veridical perceptions and\nhallucinations have the same phenomenal character. They must then say\nthat hallucinations that are subjectively indistinguishible from\nveridical perceptions do not have the kind of phenomenal character that\nintrospective reflection suggests. Some disjunctivists allow that some\nhallucinations that are subjectively indistinguishible from veridical\nperceptions have no phenomenal character (e.g., Fish 2008 and 2009; and\nsee also Sturgeon 2006 and 2008), but this is not a commitment of all\ndisjunctivists about phenomenal character.
