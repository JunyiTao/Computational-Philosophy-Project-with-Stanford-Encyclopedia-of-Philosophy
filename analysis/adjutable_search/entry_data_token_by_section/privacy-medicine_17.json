    "main_text": "Decisional Privacy || Assisted Reproductive Technology\n5.4 Assisted Reproductive Technology and Enhancements\n\nSome legal commentators and philosophers have argued that infertile\npersons have a right to procreative privacy that entails a right to\nuse technology and surrogates to bear children. Assisted reproductive\ntechnology services (\u201cART\u201d) include medicines to balance\nhormones, regulate ovulation, and stimulate the production of viable\neggs; and surgery to unblock Fallopian tubes or undo the damage of\nendometriosis, miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies and pelvic\ninflammatory disease. Reproductive services also include sperm and egg\nharvesting and donation, in vitro fertilization, zygote and\nembryo transplant, reproductive organ transplant, cryopreservation\n(\u201cfreezing\u201d) of pre-embryos, and surrogate\npregnancies.\n\nIt may be argued that the ability to freely choose ART, like the\nability to freely choose sterilization, abortion and birth control, is\ncalled for by the right to privacy. But ART use raises its own moral\nand practical concerns. One concern is the false hopes ART creates in\na world in which the technology is expensive and the success rate low.\nThe availability of affordable treatments can cause conflict within\nfamilies in some societies. Women report feeling pressured by their\nfamilies to undergo repeated painful attempts to get pregnant. It may\nargued that adoption is a more satisfying, affordable and socially\ncommendable option for becoming a parent. The use of reproductive\ntechnology has led to bioethical concerns about the handling of the\nearliest beginnings of human life. Ethical concerns surround exposing\notherwise healthy women to the uncertain health risks of repeated\nrounds of fertility drugs and high-risk multiple pregnancies with\ntwins and triplets. In a few tragic cases children created using ART\nhave been unwanted, raising questions of responsibility and the just\nrole of family law. What should happen if the people who contract with\na surrogate mother to carry a child for them using donated egg and\nsperm change their minds after a child is conceived? Should the\nmind-changers be deemed the parents? Should the gestator be deemed the\nparent; the gamete donors? Should parentage be assigned by a judge\nbased on the best interest of the child?\n\nThe realm of reproductive technology is surprisingly laissez\nfaire in the U.S., more regulated in the United Kingdom. Some\nU.S. constitutional lawyers argue that the right to bear and beget\nchildren enshrined by the Supreme Court in Fourteenth Amendment\njurisprudence is a right to bear and beget by virtually any consensual\nmeans necessary. There is a right to reproduce, they argue, and a\nright to use other people and social resources to help one reproduce.\nSome have even argued that the right to procreative privacy is a\nreason for government or employers to pay for fertility services. In\nIsrael, Germany and Taiwan, government subsidizes ART for infertile\ncouples. Some major private insurers cover fertility treatments in the\nU.S. Great Britain has enacted a statute and created a governing body\nto deal with policy and ethical questions raised by the growing\npopularity of artificial reproductive technologies. The Human\nFertilization and Embryology Act 1990 created the HFEA, an agency\ncharged to license and monitor IVF, donor insemination, human embryo\nresearch, and the storage of gametes and embryos.\n\nIt is now possible to select the sex of one\u2019s offspring. Some\nbioethicists have argued that a \u201cright to privacy\u201d\ncountermands government placing bans on sex selection. Supporters of\nsex selection sometimes argue that choosing a child\u2019s sex is a\nfuture parent\u2019s moral and legal right. Some methods of sex\nselection include: (1) Amniocentesis testing to determine sex,\nfollowed by abortion if the fetus has the undesired sex; (2) Sperm\nsorting to produce X rich or Y rich batches of sperm, followed by\nin vitro fertilization or insemination to increase chances of\nhaving a child of the desired sex; (3) preimplantation genetic\ndiagnosis (\u201cPGD\u201d) to determine the sex of a pre-embryo,\nfollowed by implantation of one or more pre-embryos of the desired\nsex. Amniocentesis and PGD were techniques developed originally to\ndetermine whether a fetus or embryo was affected by a genetic disorder\nsuch as Down\u2019s syndrome or cystic fibrosis. In some\njurisdictions abortion or PGD solely for sex-selection other than to\navoid sex-linked disorders is illegal.\n\nAdults who want children often prefer children of a particular sex, or\na \u201cbalance\u201d of male and female children, perhaps born in a\nparticular order. Medically-assisted high-tech sex selection raises\nlarge ethical issues. PGD involves creating human embryos, some of\nwhich will not be used. Freezing, destroying and giving away human\nembryos can seem inconsistent with respect for human dignity. Sex\nselection is arguably a kind of gender discrimination and could\nheighten problems of pernicious gender discrimination. Sex selection\nplays into gender stereotypes and could someday throw off the\nsocietal, even global balance of males and females. Sex-selection is\ncontroversial as a first step on a slippery slop toward\n\u201cdesigner babies\u201d.\n\nMen and women in developed countries are \u201cdesigning\u201d their\nbabies (Parens and Knowles 2003). In the context of fertility\nmedicine, patients select donated egg and sperm based on criteria such\nas the race, IQ, SAT scores, and detailed physical profiles of the\ndonors. The capacity to select the traits of offspring is likely to\nexpand in the coming years. It has been argued that a \u201cright to\nprivacy\u201d countermands government placing bans on trait selection\nthrough genetic selection and manipulation. If women and their\npartners had an unlimited right to reproductive autonomy, it arguably\nwould follow that they have a right to use technologies that enable\nthem to choose the precise traits of their children. Yet the right is\nclearly not unlimited, and using technology to achieve\n\u201cperfect\u201d or \u201csuperior\u201d humans may be\nunethical, even if using technology to screen out tragic abnormalities\nand diseases representing extremes of suffering is not (Presidential\nCommission 2015b).\n\nMichael Sandel has argued that the quest for genetic enhancements and\nother god-like mastery over the human body reflects a failure to\nappreciate fully the \u201cgiftedness\u201d of life and the ethical\nvalue of \u201chumility, responsibility, and solidarity\u201d\n(Sandel 2007: 12 and 86). Ronald Green has cautioned against a\nstatus quo bias that leads us to the irrational conclusion\nthat human beings should remain as they are (Green 2008: 9). John\nHarris has moved several steps beyond Ronald Green in building a case\nagainst preserving the status quo. Offering what he calls \u201cthe\nethical case for making people better\u201d, Harris has argued that\nsociety ought to leap on opportunities to create \u201chealthier,\nlonger lived, and altogether \u2018better\u2019 individuals\u201d\n(Harris 2007). In the future, the notion of decisional privacy may\nplay a major role in building a case for allowing individuals and\nfamilies to use or refuse genetic, pharmaceutical and other forms of\nenhancements.\n\nThe issue of biological enhancement is not limited to the context of\nprenatal intervention. Concepts of health privacy may be brought to\nbear on questions surrounding the ethics of electing to utilize\nmedical procedures or drugs to improve the motor and cognitive\ncapacities of people seeking to be \u201cnormal\u201d or\n\u201csuperior\u201d. The privacy-as-autonomy argument for allowing\nlargely unfettered choice has been less controversial where persons\nand clinicians aim to bring someone who is suffering from disease or\ndisability to within normal ranges, than where the aim is to enable\nsomeone to surpass normal levels. Thus, prescribing or taking Ritalin\nto combat ADD/HD may meet with moral approval as a matter of medical\nprivacy, while prescribing or taking Ritalin to achieve a higher SAT\nscore does not (Presidential Commission 2015b).\n",
