Other Modalities and the Philosophy of Perception\n\nThe philosophy of sounds and auditory perception is one area of the\nphilosophy of perception that reaches beyond vision for insights about\nthe nature, objects, contents, and varieties of perception. This entry\ncharacterizes central issues in the philosophy of auditory perception,\nmany of which bear upon theorizing about perception more generally,\nand it mentions outstanding questions and promising future areas for\ninquiry in this developing literature. Before beginning the\nsubstantive discussion of audition itself, it is worthwhile to discuss\nthe motivation and rationale for this kind of work.\n\nPhilosophical thinking about perception has focused predominantly on\nvision. The philosophical puzzle of perception and its proposed\nsolutions have been shaped by a concern for visual experience and\nvisual illusions. Questions and proposals about the nature of\nperceptual content have been framed and evaluated in visual terms, and\ndetailed accounts of what we perceive frequently address just the\nvisual case. Vision informs our understanding of perception\u2019s\nepistemological role and of its role in guiding action. It is not a\ngreat exaggeration to say that much of the philosophy of perception\ntranslates roughly as philosophy of visual perception.\n\nRecently, however, other perceptual modalities have attracted\nattention (see, e.g., Stokes et al. 2015, Matthen 2015). In addition\nto auditory perception and the experience of sound, touch and tactile\nawareness have generated philosophical interest concerning, for\ninstance, the tactile and proprioceptive experience of space, the\nobjects of touch, whether contact is required for touch, and whether\ndistinct modalities detect pressure, heat, and pain (see, e.g.,\nO\u2019Shaughnessy 1989, Martin 1993, Scott 2001, Fulkerson 2013,\n2016). The unique phenomenology of olfaction and smells has been used\nto argue that vision is atypical in supporting the transparency of\nperceptual experience (Lycan 2000, 282; cf. Batty 2010) and that\nperceptual objectivity does not require spatiality (Smith 2002, ch 5).\nLycan (2000) even suggests that the philosophy of perception would\nhave taken a different course had it focused upon olfaction instead of\nvision (see also Batty 2011). Some authors have appealed to taste and\nflavor to challenge traditional ways of dividing and counting senses\n(Smith 2015; cf. Richardson 2013).\n\nThis kind of work is philosophically interesting in its own right. But\nit is also worthwhile because theorizing about perception commonly\naims to address general questions about perception, rather than\nconcerns specific to vision. Hope for a comprehensive and general\nunderstanding of perception rests upon extending and testing claims,\narguments, and theories beyond vision. One might view work on\nnon-visual modalities as filling out the particulars required for a\nthoroughly detailed account of perceiving that applies not just to\nvision but across the modalities. At least three approaches might be\nadopted, with potential for increasingly revisionist outcomes.\n\nFirst, one might take work on non-visual modalities as\ntranslating what we have learned from the visual case into\nterms that apply to other modalities. This approach is relatively\nconservative. It assumes that vision is representative or paradigmatic\nand that we have a good understanding of perception that is derived\nfrom the case of vision. One example of this kind of approach would be\nto develop an account of the representational content of auditory\nexperience.\n\nSecond, considering other modalities might extend our\nvision-based understanding of perception. Non-visual cases might draw\nattention to new kinds of phenomena that are missing from or not\nsalient in vision. If so, a vision-based account of perception is\nsatisfactory as far as it goes, but it leaves out critical pieces. For\nexample, speech perception, multimodal perception, and flavor\nperception might involve novel kinds of perceptual phenomena absent\nfrom the visual case.\n\nThird, considering other modalities might challenge\nvision-based claims about perception. If falsifying evidence is\ndiscovered in non-visual cases, then theorizing beyond vision may\nforce revision of general claims about perception that are supported\nby vision. For example, if olfactory experience is not diaphanous, but\nolfactory experience is perceptual, the transparency thesis for\nperceptual experience fails.\n\nFinally, we might attempt to determine whether any unified\naccount exists that applies generally to all of the perceptual\nmodalities. We can ask this question either at the level of quite\nspecific claims, such as those concerning the objects of perception or\nthe nature and structure of content. We can ask it about the\nrelationships among perceiving, believing, and acting. Or we can ask\nit about the general theory of necessary and sufficient conditions for\nperceiving. Some philosophers, impressed by findings concerning\nnon-visual modalities, express skepticism whether a unified theory\nexists (e.g., Martin 1992).\n\nWhatever the approach, extending our knowledge about perception beyond\nthe visual requires systematic attention to individual modalities as\nwell as careful accounting in order to determine how the results bear\non general questions about perception. Whatever the outcome, audition\nis a rich subject matter in its own right, and investigating this\nsubject matter is crucial to our overall understanding of\nperception.\n",
