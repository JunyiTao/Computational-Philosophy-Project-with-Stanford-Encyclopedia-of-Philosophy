    "main_text": "The Scientific Achievement of the Principia\n9. The Scientific Achievement of the Principia\n\n\nFrom Halley's anonymous review of the first edition of the\nPrincipia forward, there has been a marked tendency to\noverstate what the Principia achieved, glossing over the many\nloose ends it left for others to recognize and address. A\nconsequence of this is an equal tendency to distort the context of the\nenormous advances made in both mechanics and orbital astronomy during\nthe eighteenth century, diminishing the difficulties those following\nNewton faced and their accomplishments in resolving them. The\nPrincipia is peculiar in this regard, for a list of its\nachievements without mentioning their loose ends overstates what it\naccomplished, but a list of its loose ends risks understating its\nextraordinary achievements. In an effort to strike a balance we\nhere list eleven major scientific issues of the time to which Book 3\nsupplied answers in the sequence listed, the answers, and the most\nimportant loose ends in the reasoning offered in the evidential\narguments for those answers.\n\n1. What physically retains the planets in\norbits around the Sun and their satellites in orbit around\nthem? Newton's answer \u2014 inverse-square gravity, one in\nkind with everyday terrestrial gravity \u2014 turned on a largely\nsuppressed failure to account for more than half of the precession of\nthe lunar orbit, it tacitly assumed interaction between the Sun and\nJupiter and the other individual planets, and it raised unanswered\nquestions about whether the perihelia of the planetary orbits do or do\nnot precess.\n\n2. How does gravity vary, both below and\nabove the surface of the Earth? In the absence of confirming\ndata, Newton's answer \u2014 to a first approximation, linearly with\ndistance to the center below the surface, and inversely with the square\nof the distance above it \u2014 presupposed uniform density in the\nfirst part and a spherical Earth with spherically symmetric density in\nthe second, and therefore left open the possibility that gravity is\nconstant near the surface of the Earth, just as Huygens continued to\nclaim in his response to the Principia [HD, 153],\nciting supporting evidence.\n\n3. What are the relative densities of the\nplanets, with respect to one another and to the Sun? Newton\ngives theory-dependent answers for Jupiter, Saturn, and the Earth in\nthe corollaries to Proposition 8, but the one for the Earth, even in\nthe third edition, depended on a still questionable value for the\nhorizontal solar parallax (required to determine the distance of the\nMoon from the Earth in astronomical units), and no corroborating\nevidence for these answers had emerged, such as from the actions of\nJupiter and Saturn on one another.\n\n4. Is there some principled way to\nresolve the dispute between the Copernican and Tychonic systems and\nthereby settle the question of the proper center to which all the\nmotions in our planetary system should be referred? Newton's\nanswer \u2014 the center of gravity of the system, about which the Sun\ncirculates at comparatively small distances \u2014 depended on the\nassumed applicability of the third law of motion in claiming that the\nSun is in motion, and the precise location of the center of gravity\nremained open in the absence of values for the relative masses of\nMercury, Venus, and Mars.\n\n5. What are the true motions of the\nplanets, and which, if any, of the schemes for calculating planet\nlocations is to be preferred, Kepler's or one of the alternatives to\nit? Newton's answer was not simple: \u201cIf the sun\nwere at rest and the remaining planets did not act upon one another,\ntheir orbits would be elliptical, having the sun in their common focus,\nand they would describe areas proportional to the times;\u201d and the\naphelia and nodes would be stationary. The Keplerian system,\namended in the manner of Horrocks to infer mean distances from the\nperiods, is therefore the preferred approximation to the true\nmotions. The main loose-end in this answer was whether the\nactual motions do deviate from the Keplerian ideal, and if so, whether\nall the deviations could be attributed to specific forces,\ngravitational or otherwise. A further loose-end, addressed in\npart in Book 3, was whether the non-Keplerian motion of the Moon can be\nshown not to be a counterexample to Newton's argument in the case of\nthe planets.\n\n6. Is the motion of Jupiter and Saturn\naberrant and, if so, what are the inequalities in it and what causes\nthem? Newton answered yes, because they interact\ngravitationally, and the dominant inequality has a period corresponding\nto the 19 years between their consecutive conjunctions. (The\nsecond part of this answer did not appear in the first edition.)\nBy the early 1720s it had become clear that the dominant period in the\nanomalies of motion of these two planets is not that of the time\nbetween conjunctions, but something of much longer duration, giving\nrise to the questions of what the vagaries actually are and whether\nthey can truly be derived from Jupiter's and Saturn's gravitational\nforces.\n\n7. How, if at all, does the Earth's\nsurface gravity vary with latitude, and how, if at all, does the\nEarth's figure differ from a sphere? Newton's answer changes\nfrom the first to the second to the third edition, but in all cases\nvagaries in the cited data raise the question of what the actual\nvariations are. Also, because his idealized theoretical\ncalculation assumes uniform density, his answer raises the questions\nwhether the density of the Earth is uniform and whether the true figure\nof the Earth and variation of surface gravity can be reconciled with\nnon-uniformities in density.\n\n8. What precisely is the motion of the\nMoon, and what gives rise to the inequalities in it, inequalities not\nobserved in the motions of the satellites of Jupiter and\nSaturn? Newton's answer to the second part is the perturbing\neffect of the Sun's gravity, leaving the answer to the first in the\nform of a promissory note: work out all the perturbations from solar\ngravity, and you will have the answer. The major open question\nwas whether the complex motion of the line of apsides and the\ninequality known as the evection \u2014 the two features for which the\nHorrocksian cinematic model that Newton had employed in the Scholium to\nBook 3, Proposition 35 had resorted to an old-fashoined epicycle \u2014 can\nbe derived from the action of solar gravity.\n\n9. What causes the tides, and why do they\nvary in time as well as from place to place in the way they\ndo? Because Newton's answer \u2014 the gravitational action\nof the Sun and the Moon \u2014 was merely qualitative, it left room to\nquestion whether the Moon attracts the Earth and, if so, by how strong\na force. Also left open was the question of how the inertia and\nviscosity of the seas and the rotation of the Earth affect the tides, a\nquestion requiring a dynamic analysis of the motions of the seas in\nresponse to solar and lunar gravity.\n\n10. What physically produces the\nprecession of the equinoxes? Newton's derivation of the\nprecession from the gravitational action of the Moon and Sun raised\nthree unresolved questions: What are the correct values for the mass of\nthe Moon and the oblateness of the Earth? Is the resulting motion\nof the Earth really analogous to that of the lunar nodes? How\ndoes the varying inclination of the Moon affect the calculated\nmotion?\n\n11. What trajectories do comets\ndescribe? Newton's answer \u2014 conic-sections that can at\nleast be approximated by parabolas in the region in which they are\nobservable \u2014 gave weight to the question whether the parabolic\ntrajectory works for all comets, and not just the comet of 1680-81 in\nthe case of the first edition, the three others analyzed in the second,\nand the additional one in the third. The Principia also\nleft open questions about how the gravity of Jupiter and Saturn might\naffect comet motions, whether any significance should be attached to\nthe residual discrepancies between theory and observation in Newton's\nresults, and which, if any, comets do return in some regular\nfashion.\n\n\nCareful reading of the Principia makes clear that, although\nunforthcoming about any of the loose ends, Newton was perfectly aware\nof them all, in one way or another flagging each for the benefit of the\nhighly astute reader. An instructive way to present the history\nof eighteenth century research in the wake of the Principia is\nto trace how each of the loose ends became a prominent matter of\nconcern and was then resolved, at least to the point of being removed\nas in any way a threat to Newton's theory of gravity. This\nprocess of addressing the loose ends in Book 3 did not get underway\nuntil the 1730s, after Newton had died. During his lifetime the\nmost pressing complaint against the Principia was the absence\nof a mechanism to account for its action save for action at a distance,\nwhich Newton himself regarded as \u201cso great an absurdity, that I\nbelieve no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of\nthinking can ever fall into\n it.\u201d[56]\nThe absence of a mechanism, however,\nwas not something that Newton himself regarded as a loose-end in the\nPrincipia, for he insisted that all the conclusions listed\nabove could be established, and any loose ends in them resolved,\nthrough the law of universal gravity alone, independently of the\nmechanism responsible for it. Over the decades after he died,\nthose engaged in research predicated on his theory of gravity came\nincreasingly to this same view of the question of mechanism.\n",
