    "main_text": "The Role of Mental Simulation in Mindreading || The Centrality of Mental Simulation in Mindreading\n4.1 The Centrality of Mental Simulation in Mindreading\n\nST proposes that mental simulation plays a central role in\nmindreading, i.e., it plays a central role in the capacity to\nrepresent and reason about others\u2019 mental state. What does\n\u201ccentral\u201d mean here? Does it mean the central\nrole, with other contributors to mindreading being merely peripheral?\nThis is an important question, since in recent years there have been\nproposed hybrid models according to which both mental simulation and\ntheorizing play important roles in mindreading (see\n section 5.2).\n \n\nA possible interpretation of the claim that mental simulation plays a\ncentral role in representing others\u2019 mental states is that\nmindreading events are always simulation-based, even if they\nsometimes also involve theory. Some Simulation Theorists, however,\nreject this interpretation, since they maintain that there are\nmindreading events in which mental simulation plays no role at all\n(Currie & Ravenscroft 2002). For example, if I know that Little\nJimmy is happy every time he finds a dollar, and I also know that he\nhas just found a dollar, I do not need to undergo any simulation\nprocess to conclude that Little Jimmy is happy right now. I just need\nto carry out a simple logical inference.\n\nHowever, generalizations like, \u201cLittle Jimmy is happy every time\nhe finds a dollar,\u201d are ceteris paribus rules. People\nreadily recognize exceptions: for example, we recognize situations in\nwhich Jimmy would probably not be happy even if he found a dollar,\nincluding some in which finding a dollar might actually make him\nunhappy. Rather than applying some additional or more complex rules\nthat cover such situations, it is arguable that putting ourselves in\nJimmy's situation and using \u201cgood common sense\u201d alerts us\nto to these exceptions and overrides the rule. If that is correct,\nthen simulation is acting as an overseer or governor even when people\nappear to be simply applying rules. \n\nGoldman (2006) suggests that we cash out the central role of mental\nsimulation in representing others\u2019 mental states as follows:\nmindreading is often simulation-based. Goldman\u2019s\nsuggestion, however, turns out to be empty, since he explicitly\nrefuses to specify what \u201coften\u201d means in this context.\n\n\n\nHow often is often? Every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday? Precisely\nwhat claim does ST mean to make? It is unreasonable to demand a\nprecise answer at this time. (Goldman 2006: 42; see also Goldman 2002;\nJeannerod & Pacherie 2004)\n\n\nPerhaps a better way to go is to characterize the centrality of mental\nsimulation for mindreading not in terms of frequency of use,\nbut in terms of importance. Currie and Ravenscroft make the\nvery plausible suggestion that \u201cone way to see how important a\nfaculty is for performing a certain task is to examine what happens\nwhen the faculty is lacking or damaged\u201d (Currie &\nRavenscroft 2002: 51). On this basis, one could say that mental\nsimulation plays a central role in mindreading if and only\nif: if one\u2019s simulational capacity (i.e., the capacity to\nundergo simulation processes/simulated mental states) were impaired,\nthen one\u2019s mindreading capacity would be significantly\nimpaired. \n\nAn elaboration of this line of thought comes from Gordon (2005)\u2014\nsee also Gordon (1986, 1996) and Peacocke (2005)\u2014who argues that\nsomeone lacking the capacity for mental simulation would not be able\nto represent mental states as such, since she is incapable of\nrepresenting anyone as having a mind in the first place.\nGordon\u2019s argument is essentially as follows:\n\n\nWe represent something as having a mind, as having mental states and\nprocesses, only if we represent it as a subject (\u201csubject of\nexperience,\u201d in formulations of \u201cthe hard problem of\nconsciousness\u201d), where \u201ca subject\u201d is understood as\na generic \u201cI\u201d. This distinguishes it from a \u201cmere\nobject\u201d (and also is a necessary condition for a more benevolent\nsort of empathy).\n\nTo represent something as another \u201cI\u201d is to represent it\nas a possible target of self-projection: as something one might (with\nvarying degrees of success) imaginatively put oneself in the place of.\n(Of course, one can fancifully put oneself in the place of just about\nanything\u2014a suspension bridge, even; but that is not a\nreductio ad absurdum, because one can also fancifully\nrepresent just about anything as having a mind.) \n\n\nIt is not clear, however, what consequences Gordon\u2019s conceptual\nargument would have for mindreading, if any. Even if a capacity to\nself-project were needed for representing mental states as such, would\nlack of this capacity necessarily impair mindreading? That is,\ncouldn't one predict explain, predict, and coordinate behavior using a\ntheory of internal states, without conceptualizing these as states of\nan I or subject? As a more general point, Simulation Theorists have\nnever provided a principled account of what would constitute a\n\u201csignificant impairment\u201d of mindreading capacity.\n\nTo cut a long story short, ST claims that mental simulation plays a\ncentral role in mindreading, but at the present stage its proponents\ndo not agree on what this centrality exactly amounts to. We will come\nback to this issue in\n section 5,\n when we shall discuss the respective contributions of mental\nsimulation and theorizing in mindreading.\n\nWe now turn to a different problem: how does mental simulation\ncontribute to mindreading when it does? That is, how does\nsimulation-based mindreading work? Here again, Simulation Theorists\ndisagree about what the right answer is. In what follows, we explore\nsome dimensions of disagreement.\n",
