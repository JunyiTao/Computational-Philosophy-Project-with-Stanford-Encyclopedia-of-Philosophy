    "preamble": "\n\nScientific inquiry has led to immense explanatory and technological\nsuccesses, partly as a result of the pervasiveness of scientific\ntheories. Relativity theory, evolutionary theory, and plate tectonics\nwere, and continue to be, wildly successful families of theories\nwithin physics, biology, and geology. Other powerful theory clusters\ninhabit comparatively recent disciplines such as cognitive science,\nclimate science, molecular biology, microeconomics, and Geographic\nInformation Science (GIS). Effective scientific theories magnify\nunderstanding, help supply legitimate explanations, and assist in\nformulating predictions.

    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nIn philosophy, three families of perspectives on scientific theory are\noperative: the Syntactic View, the Semantic View,\nand the Pragmatic View. Savage distills these philosophical\nperspectives thus:\n\nThe syntactic view that a theory is an axiomatized collection\nof sentences has been challenged by the semantic view that a\ntheory is a collection of nonlinguistic models, and both are\nchallenged by the view that a theory is an amorphous entity consisting\nperhaps of sentences and models, but just as importantly of exemplars,\nproblems, standards, skills, practices and tendencies. (Savage 1990,\nvii\u2013viii)\n\n\nMormann (2007) characterizes the Syntactic and Semantic Views in\nsimilar terms, and is among the first to use the term \u201cPragmatic\nView\u201d to capture the third view (137). The three views are\nbaptized via a trichotomy from linguistics deriving from the work of\nCharles Morris, following Charles S. Peirce. In a classic exposition,\nthe logical positivist Carnap writes:\n\nIf in an investigation explicit reference is made to the speaker, or,\nto put it in more general terms, to the user of a language, then we\nassign it to the field of pragmatics. (Whether in this case\nreference to designata is made or not makes no difference for this\nclassification.) If we abstract from the user of the language and\nanalyze only the expressions and their designata, we are in the field\nof semantics. And if, finally, we abstract from the designata\nalso and analyze only the relations between the expressions, we are in\n(logical) syntax. The whole science of language, consisting\nof the three parts mentioned, is called semiotic. (1942, 9;\nsee also Carnap 1939, 3\u20135, 16)\n\n\nTo summarize, syntax concerns grammar and abstract structures;\nsemantics investigates meaning and representation; and pragmatics\nexplores use. Importantly, while no view is oblivious to the syntax,\nsemantics, or pragmatics of theory, the baptism of each is a product\nof how one of the three aspects of language is perceived to be\ndominant: theory as syntactic logical reconstruction (Syntactic View);\ntheory as semantically meaningful mathematical modeling (Semantic\nView); or theory structure as complex and as closely tied to theory\npragmatics, i.e., function and context (Pragmatic View). Each of these\nphilosophical perspectives on scientific theory will be reviewed in\nthis entry. Their relations will be briefly considered in the\nConclusion.\n1.1 Syntactic, Semantic, and Pragmatic Views: The Basics\n\nIt will be helpful to pare each perspective down to its essence. Each\nendorses a substantive thesis about the structure of scientific\ntheories.\n\nFor the Syntactic View, the structure of a scientific theory is its\nreconstruction in terms of sentences cast in a metamathematical\nlanguage. Metamathematics is the axiomatic machinery for building\nclear foundations of mathematics, and includes predicate logic, set\ntheory, and model theory (e.g., Zach 2009; Hacking 2014). A central\nquestion of the Syntactic View is: in which logical language should we\nrecast scientific theory?\n\nSome defenders of the Semantic View keep important aspects of this\nreconstructive agenda, moving the metamathematical apparatus from\npredicate logic to set theory. Other advocates of the Semantic View\ninsist that the structure of scientific theory is solely mathematical.\nThey argue that we should remain at the mathematical level, rather\nthan move up (or down) a level, into foundations of mathematics. A\ncentral question for the Semantic View is: which mathematical models\nare actually used in science?\n\nFinally, for the Pragmatic View, scientific theory is internally and\nexternally complex. Mathematical components, while often present, are\nneither necessary nor sufficient for characterizing the core structure\nof scientific theories. Theory also consists of a rich variety of\nnonformal components (e.g., analogies and natural kinds). Thus, the\nPragmatic View argues, a proper analysis of the grammar (syntax) and\nmeaning (semantics) of theory must pay heed to scientific theory\ncomplexity, as well as to the multifarious assumptions, purposes,\nvalues, and practices informing theory. A central question the\nPragmatic View poses is: which theory components and which modes of\ntheorizing are present in scientific theories found across a variety\nof disciplines?\n\nIn adopting a descriptive perspective on the structure of\nscientific theories, each view also deploys, at least implicitly, a\nprescriptive characterization of our central topic. In other\nwords, postulating that scientific theory is \\(X\\) (e.g., \\(X\\) = a\nset-theoretic structure, as per Suppes 1960, 1962, 1967, 1968, 2002)\nalso implies that what is not \\(X\\) (or could not be recast as \\(X\\))\nis not (or could not possibly be) a scientific theory, and would not\nhelp us in providing scientific understanding, explanation,\nprediction, and intervention. For the Syntactic View, what is not (or\ncannot be) reconstructed axiomatically is not theoretical, while for\nthe Semantic View, what is not (or cannot be) modeled mathematically\nis not theoretical. In contrast, in part due to its pluralism about\nwhat a scientific theory actually (and possibly) is, and because it\ninterprets theory structure as distributed in practices, the Pragmatic\nView resists the definitional and normative terms set by the other two\nviews. As a result, the Pragmatic View ultimately reforms the very\nconcepts of \u201ctheory\u201d and \u201ctheory structure.\u201d\n\n\nThis encyclopedia entry will be organized as follows. After presenting\nthis piece\u2019s two sustained examples, immediately below, the\nthree views are reviewed in as many substantive sections. Each section\nstarts with a brief overview before characterizing that\nperspective\u2019s account of theory structure. Newtonian mechanics\nis used as a running example within each section. The interpretation\nof theory structure\u2014viz., how theory \u201chooks up\u201d with\nphenomena, experiment, and the world\u2014is also reviewed in each\nsection. In the final section of this entry, we turn to population\ngenetics and an analysis of the Hardy-Weinberg Principle (HWP) to\ncompare and contrast each view. The Conclusion suggests, and remains\nnon-committal about, three kinds of relations among the views:\nidentity, combat, and complementarity.\nTheory is not a single, static entity that we are seeing from three\ndifferent perspectives, as we might represent the Earth using three\ndistinct mathematical map projections. Rather, theory itself changes\nas a consequence of perspective adopted.\n1.2 Two Examples: Newtonian Mechanics and Population Genetics\n\nTwo examples will be used to illustrate differences between the three\nviews: Newtonian mechanics and population genetics. While relativity\ntheory is the preferred theory of the Syntactic View,\nNewtonian mechanics is more straightforward. Somewhat permissively\nconstrued, the theory of Newtonian mechanics employs the basic\nconceptual machinery of inertial reference frames, centers of mass,\nNewton\u2019s laws of motion, etc., to describe the dynamics and\nkinematics of, among other phenomena, point masses acting\nvis-\u00e0-vis gravitational forces (e.g. the solar system) or with\nrespect to forces involved in collisions (e.g., pool balls on a pool\ntable; a closed container filled with gas). Newtonian mechanics is\nexplored in each section.\n\nPopulation genetics investigates the genetic composition of\npopulations of natural and domesticated species, including the\ndynamics and causes of changes in gene frequencies in such populations\n(for overviews, see Lloyd 1994 [1988]; Gould 2002; Pigliucci and\nM\u00fcller 2010; Okasha 2012). Population genetics emerged as a\ndiscipline with the early 20th century work of R.A. Fisher,\nSewall Wright, and J.B.S. Haldane, who synthesized Darwinian\nevolutionary theory and Mendelian genetics. One important part of\npopulation genetic theory is the Hardy-Weinberg Principle. HWP is a\nnull model mathematically stating that gene frequencies remain\nunchanged across generations when there is no selection, migration,\nrandom genetic drift, or other evolutionary forces acting in a given\npopulation. HWP peppers early chapters of many introductory textbooks\n(e.g., Crow and Kimura 1970; Hartl and Clark 1989; Bergstrom and\nDugatkin 2012). We return to HWP in Section 5 and here merely state\nquestions each view might ask about population genetics.\n\nThe Syntactic View focuses on questions regarding the highest\naxiomatic level of population genetics (e.g., Williams 1970, 1973; Van\nValen 1976; Lewis 1980; Tuomi 1981, 1992). Examples of such queries\nare:\n\nWhat would be the most convenient metamathematical axiomatization\nof evolutionary processes (e.g., natural selection, drift, migration,\nspeciation, competition)? In which formal language(s) would and could\nsuch axiomatizations be articulated (e.g., first-order predicate\nlogic, set theory, and category theory)?\nWhich single grammars could contain a variety of deep evolutionary\nprinciples and concepts, such as HWP, \u201cheritability,\u201d and\n\u201ccompetitive exclusion\u201d?\nWhich formal and methodological tools would permit a smooth flow\nfrom the metamathematical axiomatization to the mathematical theory of\npopulation genetics?\n\n\nInvestigations of the axiomatized rational reconstruction of theory\nshed light on the power and promises, and weaknesses and\nincompleteness, of the highest-level theoretical edifice of population\ngenetics. \n\nSecondly, the Semantic View primarily examines questions regarding the\nmathematical structure of population genetics (Lewontin 1974, Beatty\n1981; L\u00f3pez Beltr\u00e1n 1987; Thompson 1989, 2007; Lloyd\n1994 [1988]). Very generally, this exploration involves the following\nquestions:\n\nWhat is the form and content of the directly presented class of\nmathematical models of evolutionary theory (e.g., HWP)? How could and\nshould we organize the cluster of mathematical models (sensu Levins\n1966) of population genetics?\nWhich additional models (e.g., diagrammatic, narrative, scale)\nmight be used to enrich our understanding of evolutionary theory?\nWhat are the relations among theoretical mathematical models, data\nmodels, and experimental models? How does theory explain and shape\ndata? How do the data constrain and confirm theory?\n\n\nThe main subject of investigation is mathematical structure, rather\nthan metamathematics or even alternative model types or modeling\nmethods. \n\nFinally, the Pragmatic View asks about the internal complexity of\npopulation genetic theory, as well as about the development and\ncontext of population genetics. In so doing, it inquires into how\npurposes and values have influenced the theoretical structure of\nevolutionary theory, selecting and shaping current population genetics\nfrom a wide variety of possible alternative theoretical articulations.\nThe following questions about the structure of population genetic\ntheory might be here addressed:\n\nWhat role did R.A. Fisher\u2019s interest in animal husbandry,\nand his tenure at Rothamsted Experimental Station, play in shaping his\ninfluential methodologies of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and\nexperimental design involving randomization, blocking, and factorial\ndesigns?\nHow did the development of computers and computational practices,\nstatistical techniques, and the molecularization of genetics, shape\ntheory and theorizing in population genetics, especially from the\n1980s to today?\nHow might normative context surrounding the concept of\n\u201crace\u201d impact the way concepts such as\n\u201cheritability\u201d and \u201clineage,\u201d or principles\nsuch as HWP, are deployed in population genetics?\n\n\nAs when studying an organism, the structure of theory cannot be\nunderstood independently of its history and function.\n2. The Syntactic View\n\nAccording to the Syntactic View, which emerged mainly out of work of\nthe Vienna Circle and Logical Empiricism (see Coffa 1991; Friedman\n1999; Creath 2014; Uebel 2014), philosophy most generally practiced\nis, and should be, the study of the logic of natural science, or\nWissenschaftslogik (Carnap 1937, 1966; Hempel 1966). Robust\nand clear logical languages allow us to axiomatically reconstruct\ntheories, which\u2014by the Syntacticists\u2019 definition\u2014are\nsets of sentences in a given logical domain language (e.g.,\nCampbell 1920, 122; Hempel 1958, 46; cf. Carnap 1967 [1928],\n\u00a7156, \u201cTheses about the Constructional System\u201d). Domain languages\ninclude \u201cthe language of physics, the language of\nanthropology\u201d (Carnap 1966, 58). \n\nThis view has been variously baptized as the Received View (Putnam\n1962; Hempel 1970), the Syntactic Approach (van Fraassen 1970, 1989),\nthe Syntactic View (Wessels 1976), the Standard Conception (Hempel\n1970), the Orthodox View (Feigl 1970), the Statement View (Moulines\n1976, 2002; Stegm\u00fcller 1976), the Axiomatic Approach (van\nFraassen 1989), and the Once Received View (Craver 2002). For\nhistorical reasons, and because of the linguistic trichotomy discussed\nabove, the \u201cSyntactic View\u201d shall be the name of choice in\nthis entry.\n2.1 Theory Structure per the Syntactic View\n\nSome conceptual taxonomy is required in order to understand the\nlogical framework of the structure of scientific theories for the\nSyntactic View. We shall distinguish terms,\nsentences, and languages (see Table 1). \n2.1.1 Terms\n\nBuilding upwards from the bottom, let us start with the three kinds of\nterms or vocabularies contained in a scientific language: theoretical,\nlogical, and observational. Examples of theoretical terms are\n\u201cmolecule,\u201d \u201catom,\u201d \u201cproton,\u201d and\n\u201cprotein,\u201d and perhaps even macro-level objects and properties\nsuch as \u201cproletariat\u201d and \u201caggregate demand.\u201d\nTheoretical terms or concepts can be classificatory (e.g.,\n\u201ccat\u201d or \u201cproton\u201d), comparative (e.g.,\n\u201cwarmer\u201d), or quantitative (e.g.,\n\u201ctemperature\u201d) (Hempel 1952; Carnap 1966, Chapter 5).\nMoreover, theoretical terms are \u201ctheoretical constructs\u201d\nintroduced \u201cjointly\u201d as a \u201ctheoretical system\u201d\n(Hempel 1952, 32). Logical terms include quantifiers (e.g., \\(\\forall,\n\\exists\\)) and connectives (e.g., \\(\\wedge, \\rightarrow\\)). Predicates\nsuch as \u201chard,\u201d \u201cblue,\u201d and \u201chot,\u201d\nand relations such as \u201cto the left of\u201d and \u201csmoother\nthan,\u201d are observational terms. \n2.1.2 Sentences\n\nTerms can be strung together into three kinds of sentences:\ntheoretical, correspondence, and observational. \\(T_S\\) is the set of\ntheoretical sentences that are the axioms, theorems, and laws of the\ntheory. Theoretical sentences include the laws of Newtonian mechanics\nand of the Kinetic Theory of Gases, all suitably axiomatized (e.g.,\nCarnap 1966; Hempel 1966). Primitive theoretical sentences (e.g.,\naxioms) can be distinguished from derivative theoretical sentences\n(e.g., theorems; see Reichenbach 1969 [1924]; Hempel 1958; Feigl\n1970). \\(C_S\\) is the set of correspondence sentences tying\ntheoretical sentences to observable phenomena or \u201cto a\n\u2018piece of reality\u2019\u201d (Reichenbach 1969 [1924], 8; cf.\nEinstein 1934, 1936 [1936], 351). To simplify, they provide the\ntheoretical syntax with an interpretation and an application, i.e., a\nsemantics. Suitably axiomatized version of the following sentences\nprovide semantics to Boyle\u2019s law, \\(PV = nRT\\): \u201c\\(V\\) in\nBoyle\u2019s law is equivalent to the measurable volume \\(xyz\\) of a\nphysical container such as a glass cube that is \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and\n\\(z\\) centimeters in length, width, and height, and in which the gas\nmeasured is contained\u201d and \u201c\\(T\\) in Boyle\u2019s law is\nequivalent to the temperature indicated on a reliable thermometer or\nother relevant measuring device properly calibrated, attached to the\nphysical system, and read.\u201d Carnap (1987 [1932], 466) presents\ntwo examples of observational sentences, \\(O_S\\): \u201cHere (in a\nlaboratory on the surface of the earth) is a pendulum of such and such\na kind,\u201d and \u201cthe length of the pendulum is 245.3\ncm.\u201d Importantly, theoretical sentences can only contain\ntheoretical and logical terms; correspondence sentences involve all\nthree kinds of terms; and observational sentences comprise only\nlogical and observational terms.\n2.1.3 Languages\n\nThe total domain language of science consists of two languages: the\ntheoretical language, \\(L_T\\), and the observational language, \\(L_O\\)\n(e.g., Hempel 1966, Chapter 6; Carnap 1966, Chapter 23; the index\nentry for \u201cLanguage,\u201d of Feigl, Scriven, and Maxwell 1958,\n548 has three subheadings: \u201cobservation,\u201d\n\u201ctheoretical,\u201d and \u201cordinary\u201d). The\ntheoretical language includes theoretical vocabulary, while the\nobservational language involves observational terms. Both languages\ncontain logical terms. Finally, the theoretical language includes, and\nis constrained by, the logical calculus, Calc, of the\naxiomatic system adopted (e.g., Hempel 1958, 46; Suppe 1977, 50-53).\nThis calculus specifies sentence grammaticality as well as appropriate\ndeductive and non-ampliative inference rules (e.g., modus ponens)\npertinent to, especially, theoretical sentences. Calc can\nitself be written in theoretical sentences.\n2.1.4 Theory Structure, in General\n\nTable 1 summarizes the Syntactic View\u2019s account of theory\nstructure:\n\nTable 1\n\n\nTheory\nObservation \n\nSentence Type\n\\(T_S\\)\n\\(C_S\\)\n\\(O_S\\) \n\nTerm (or vocabulary)\nTheoretical & logical\nTheoretical, logical & observational\nObservational & logical \n\nLanguage\n\\(L_T\\)\n\\(L_T\\) & \\(L_O\\)\n\\(L_O\\) \n\n\nThe salient divide is between theory and observation. Building on\nTable 1, there are three different levels of scientific knowledge,\naccording to the Syntactic View:\n\n\\(\\{T_S\\} =\\) The uninterpreted syntactic system of the scientific\ntheory.\n\n\\(\\{T_S, C_S\\} =\\) The scientific theory structure of a particular\ndomain (e.g., physics, anthropology).\n\n\\(\\{T_S,C_S,O_S\\} =\\) All of the science of a particular domain. \n\nScientific theory is thus taken to be a syntactically formulated set\nof theoretical sentences (axioms, theorems, and laws) together with\ntheir interpretation via correspondence sentences. As we have seen,\ntheoretical sentences and correspondence sentences are cleanly\ndistinct, even if both are included in the structure of a scientific\ntheory.\n\nOpen questions remain. Is the observation language a sub-language of\nthe theoretical language, or are they both parts of a fuller language\nincluding all the vocabulary? Can the theoretical vocabulary or\nlanguage be eliminated in favor of a purely observational vocabulary\nor language? Are there other ways of carving up kinds of languages?\nFirst, a \u201cdialectical opposition\u201d between \u201clogic and\nexperience,\u201d \u201cform and content,\u201d \u201cconstitutive\nprinciples and empirical laws,\u201d and \u201c\u2018from\nabove\u2019\u2026 [and] \u2018from below\u2019\u201d pervades\nthe work of the syntacticists (Friedman 1999, 34, 63). Whether\nsyntacticists believe that a synthesis or unification of this general\nopposition between the theoretical (i.e., logic, form) and the\nobservational (i.e., experience, content) is desirable remains a topic\nof ongoing discussion. Regarding the second question, Hempel 1958\ndeflates what he calls \u201cthe theoretician\u2019s\ndilemma\u201d\u2014i.e., the putative reduction without remainder of\ntheoretical concepts and sentences to observational concepts and\nsentences. Finally, other language divisions are possible, as Carnap\n1937 argues (see Friedman 1999, Chapter 7). Returning to the main\nthread of this section, the distinction toolkit of theoretical and\nobservational terms, sentences, and languages (Table 1) permit the\nsyntacticists to render theoretical structure sharply, thereby aiming\nat the reconstructive \u201clogic of science\u201d\n(Wissenschafstlogik) that they so desire.\n2.2 A Running Example: Newtonian Mechanics\n\nReichenbach 1969 [1924] stands as a canonical attempt by a central\ndeveloper of the Syntactic View of axiomatizing a physical theory,\nviz., relativity theory (cf. Friedman 1983, 1999; see also Reichenbach\n1965 [1920]). For the purposes of this encyclopedia entry, it is\npreferable to turn to another syntactic axiomatization effort. In\naxiomatizing Newtonian mechanics, the mid-20th century\nmathematical logician Hans Hermes spent significant energy defining\nthe concept of mass (Hermes 1938, 1959; Jammer 1961). More precisely,\nhe defines the theoretical concept of \u201cmass ratio\u201d of two\nparticles colliding inelastically in an inertial reference frame\n\\(S\\). Here is his full definition of mass ratio (1959, 287):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mass }  \\alpha xx_0 \\equiv_{df} \\exists S,t,y,y_o,v,v_0 \n  (G_{xy} \\wedge G_{x_0y_0} \\wedge CSt_{yy_0} \\wedge Vel_{Svty} \n      \\wedge Vel_{Sv_0ty_0} \\wedge \\alpha|v| = |v_0|) \\vee\n      (G_{xx_0} \\wedge \\alpha = 1)\n\\]\n\n\nOne paraphrase of this definition is, \u201c\u2018the mass of \\(x\\)\nis \u03b1 times that of \\(x_0\\)\u2019 is equivalent to \u2018there\nexists a system \\(S\\), an instant \\(t\\), momentary mass points \\(y\\)\nand \\(y_0\\), and initial velocities \\(v\\) and \\(v_0\\), such that \\(y\\)\nand \\(y_0\\) are genidentical, respectively, with \\(x\\) and \\(x_0\\);\nthe joined mass points move with a velocity of 0 with respect to frame\n\\(S\\) immediately upon colliding at time \\(t\\); and \\(y\\) and \\(y_0\\)\nhave determinate velocities \\(v\\) and \\(v_0\\) before the collision in\nthe ratio \u03b1, which could also be 1 if \\(x\\) and \\(x_0\\) are\nthemselves genidentical.\u2019\u201d Hermes employs the notion of\n\u201cgenidentical\u201d to describe the relation between two\ntemporal sections of a given particle\u2019s world line\n(Jammer 1961, 113). Set aside the worry that two distinct particles\ncannot be genidentical per Hermes\u2019 definition, though they can\nhave identical properties. In short, this definition is syntactically\ncomplete and is written in first-order predicate logic, as are the\nother axioms and definitions in Hermes (1938, 1959). Correspondence\nrules connecting a postulated mass \\(x\\) with an actual mass were not\narticulated by Hermes.\n2.3 Interpreting Theory Structure per the Syntactic View\n\nThe link between theory structure and the world, under the Syntactic\nView, is contained in the theory itself: \\(C_S\\), the set of\ncorrespondence rules. The term \u201ccorrespondence rules\u201d\n(Margenau 1950; Nagel 1961, 97\u2013105; Carnap 1966, Chapter 24) has\na variety of near-synonyms:\n\nDictionary (Campbell 1920)\nOperational rules (Bridgman 1927)\nCoordinative definitions (Reichenbach 1969 [1924], 1938)\nReduction sentences (Carnap 1936/1937; Hempel 1952)\nCorrespondence postulates (Carnap 1963)\nBridge principles (Hempel 1966; Kitcher 1984)\nReduction functions (Schaffner 1969, 1976)\nBridge laws (Sarkar 1998)\n\n\nImportant differences among these terms cannot be mapped out here.\nHowever, in order to better understand correspondence rules, two of\ntheir functions will be considered: (i) theory interpretation\n(Carnap, Hempel) and (ii) theory reduction (Nagel,\nSchaffner). The dominant perspective on correspondence rules is that\nthey interpret theoretical terms. Unlike \u201cmathematical\ntheories,\u201d the axiomatic system of physics \u201ccannot\nhave\u2026 a splendid isolation from the world\u201d (Carnap 1966,\n237). Instead, scientific theories require observational\ninterpretation through correspondence rules. Even so, surplus meaning\nalways remains in the theoretical structure (Hempel 1958, 87; Carnap\n1966). Second, correspondence rules are seen as necessary for\ninter-theoretic reduction (van Riel and Van Gulick 2014). For\ninstance, they connect observation terms such as\n\u201ctemperature\u201d in phenomenological thermodynamics (the\nreduced theory) to theoretical concepts such as \u201cmean kinetic\nenergy\u201d in statistical mechanics (the reducing theory).\nCorrespondence rules unleash the reducing theory\u2019s epistemic\npower. Notably, Nagel (1961, Chapter 11; 1979) and Schaffner (1969,\n1976, 1993) allow for multiple kinds of correspondence rules, between\nterms of either vocabulary, in the reducing and the reduced theory\n(cf. Callender 1999; Winther 2009; Dizadji-Bahmani, Frigg, and\nHartmann 2010). Correspondence rules are a core part of the structure\nof scientific theories and serve as glue between theory and\nobservation.\n\nFinally, while they are not part of the theory structure, and although\nwe saw some examples above, observation sentences are worth briefly\nreviewing. Correspondence rules attach to the content of observational\nsentences. Observational sentences were analyzed as (i) protocol\nsentences or Protokolls\u00e4tze (e.g., Schlick 1934;\nCarnap 1987 [1932], 1937, cf. 1963; Neurath 1983 [1932]), and as (ii)\nexperimental laws (e.g., Campbell 1920; Nagel 1961; Carnap\n1966; cf. Duhem 1954 [1906]). Although constrained by Calc,\nthe grammar of these sentences is determined primarily by the order of\nnature, as it were. In general, syntacticists do not consider methods\nof data acquisition, experiment, and measurement to be philosophically\ninteresting. In contrast, the confirmation relation between\n(collected) data and theory, especially as developed in inductive\nlogic (e.g., Reichenbach 1938, 1978; Carnap 1962 [1950], 1952), as\nwell as questions about the conventionality, grammaticality,\nfoundationalism, atomism, and content of sense-data and synthetic\nstatements, are considered philosophically important (e.g., Carnap\n1987 [1932], 1937, 1966; Neurath 1983 [1932]; Reichenbach 1951;\nSchlick 1925 [1918], 1934; for contemporary commentary, see, e.g.,\nCreath 1987, 2014; Rutte 1991; Friedman 1999).\n2.4 Taking Stock: Syntactic View\n\nTo summarize, the Syntactic View holds that there are three kinds of\nterms or vocabularies: logical, theoretical, and observational; three\nkinds of sentences: \\(T_S\\), \\(C_S\\), and \\(O_S\\); and two languages:\n\\(L_T\\) and \\(L_O\\). Moreover, the structure of scientific theories\ncould be analyzed using the logical tools of metamathematics. The goal\nis to reconstruct the logic of science, viz. to articulate an\naxiomatic system.\n\nInterestingly, this perspective has able and active defenders today,\nwho discuss constitutive and axiomatized principles of the historical\n\u201crelativized a priori\u201d (Friedman 2001, cf. 2013), argue\nthat \u201cthe semantic view, if plausible, is syntactic\u201d\n(Halvorson 2013), and explore \u201clogicism\u201d for, and in, the\nphilosophy of science (Demopulous 2003, 2013; van Benthem 2012).\nFurthermore, for purposes of the syntactic reconstruction of\nscientific theories, some continue espousing\u2014or perhaps plea for\nthe resurrection of\u2014predicate logic (e.g., Lutz 2012, 2014),\nwhile other contemporary syntacticists (e.g., Halvorson 2012, 2013,\n2019) endorse more recently developed metamathematical and\nmathematical equipment, such as category theory, which \u201cturns\nout to be a kind of universal mathematical language like set\ntheory\u201d (Awodey 2006, 2; see Eilenberg and MacLane 1945).\nImportantly, Halvorson (2019) urges that interlocutors adopt\n\u201cstructured\u201d rather than \u201cflat\u201d views of\ntheories. For the case of the syntactic view this would mean that\nrather than accept the usual formulation that a theory is a\nset of sentences, \u201c\u2026 [we] might say that a\ntheory consists of both sentences and inferential relations between\nthose sentences\u201d (Halvorson 2019, 277\u20138). Classical\nsyntacticists such as Rudolf Carnap (Friedman 1999, 2011; Carus 2007;\nBlatti and Lapointe 2016; Koellner ms. in Other Internet Resources)\nand Joseph Henry Woodger (Nicholson and Gawne 2014) have recently\nreceived increasing attention.\n3. The Semantic View\n\nAn overarching theme of the Semantic View is that analyzing theory\nstructure requires employing mathematical tools rather than predicate\nlogic. After all, defining scientific concepts within a specific\nformal language makes any axiomatizing effort dependent on the choice,\nnature, and idiosyncrasies of that narrowly-defined language. For\ninstance, Suppes understands first-order predicate logic, with its\n\u201clinguistic\u201d rather than \u201cset-theoretical\u201d\nentities, as \u201cutterly impractical\u201d for the formalization\nof \u201ctheories with more complicated structures like probability\ntheory\u201d (Suppes 1957, 232, 248\u20139; cf. Suppes 2002). Van\nFraassen, another influential defender of the Semantic View, believes\nthat the logical apparatus of the Syntactic View \u201chad moved us\nmille milles de toute habitation scientifique, isolated in\nour own abstract dreams\u201d (van Fraassen 1989, 225). Indeed, what\nwould the appropriate logical language for specific mathematical\nstructures be, especially when such structures could be reconstructed\nin a variety of formal languages? Why should we imprison mathematics\nand mathematical scientific theory in syntactically defined\nlanguage(s) when we could, instead, directly investigate the\nmathematical objects, relations, and functions of scientific theory?\n\n\nConsistent with the combat strategy (discussed in the Conclusion),\nhere is a list of grievances against the Syntactic View discussed at\nlength in the work of some semanticists.\n\nFirst-Order Predicate Logic Objection. Theoretical\nstructure is intrinsically and invariably tied to the specific choice\nof a language, \\(L_T\\), expressed in first-order predicate logic. This\nplaces heavy explanatory and representational responsibility on\nrelatively inflexible and limited languages.\nTheory Individuation Objection. Since theories are\nindividuated by their linguistic formulations, every change in\nhigh-level syntactic formulations will bring forth a distinct theory.\nThis produces a reductio: if \\(T_1 = p \\rightarrow q\\) and \\(T_2 =\n\\neg p \\vee q\\) then \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\), though logically equivalent,\nhave different syntactic formulations and would be distinct\ntheories.\nTheoretical/Observational Languages Objection. Drawing\nthe theoretical/observational distinction in terms of language is\ninappropriate, as observability pertains to entities rather than to\nconcepts.\nUnintended Models Objection. There is no clear way of\ndistinguishing between intended and unintended models for\nsyntactically characterized theories (e.g., the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\ntheorem, Bays 2014).\nConfused Correspondence Rules Objection. Correspondence\nrules are a confused medley of direct meaning relationships between\nterms and world, means of inter-theoretic reduction, causal\nrelationship claims, and manners of theoretical concept testing.\nTrivially True yet Non-Useful Objection. Presenting\nscientific theory in a limited axiomatic system, while clearly\nsyntactically correct, is neither useful nor honest, since scientific\ntheories are mathematical structures.\nPractice and History Ignored Objection. Syntactic\napproaches do not pay sufficient attention to the actual practice and\nhistory of scientific theorizing and experimenting.\n\n\nWhat, then, does the Semantic View propose to put in the Syntactic\nView\u2019s place?\n3.1 Theory Structure per the Semantic View\n\nEven a minimal description of the Semantic View must acknowledge two\ndistinct strategies of characterizing and comprehending theory\nstructure: the state-space and the\nset-/model-theoretic approaches. \n3.1.1 The State-Space Approach\n\nThe state-space approach emphasizes the mathematical models of actual\nscience, and draws a clear line between mathematics and\nmetamathematics. The structure of a scientific theory is identified\nwith the \u201cclass,\u201d \u201cfamily\u201d or\n\u201ccluster\u201d of mathematical models constituting it, rather\nthan with any metamathematical axioms \u201cyoked to a particular\nsyntax\u201d (van Fraassen 1989, 366). Under this analysis,\n\u201cthe correct tool for philosophy of science is mathematics, not\nmetamathematics\u201d\u2014this is Suppes\u2019 slogan, per van\nFraassen (1989, 221; 1980, 65). In particular, a state space or phase\nspace is an \\(N\\)-dimensional space, where each of the relevant\nvariables of a theory correspond to a single dimension and each point\nin that space represents a possible state of a real system.\nAn actual, real system can take on, and change, states according to\ndifferent kinds of laws, viz., laws of succession determining\npossible trajectories through that space (e.g., Newtonian kinematic\nlaws); laws of co-existence specifying the permitted regions\nof the total space (e.g., Boyle\u2019s law); and laws of\ninteraction combining multiple laws of succession or\nco-existence, or both (e.g., population genetic models combining laws\nof succession for selection and genetic drift, Wright 1969; Lloyd 1994\n[1988]; Rice 2004; Clatterbuck, Sober, and Lewontin 2013). Different\nmodels of a given theory will share some dimensions of their state\nspace while differing in others. Such models will also partially\noverlap in laws (for further discussion of state spaces, laws, and\nmodels pertinent to the Semantic View, see Suppe 1977, 224\u20138;\nLloyd 1994, Chapter 2; Nolte 2010; Weisberg 2013, 26\u20139).\n\nHistorically, the state-space approach emerged from work by Evert\nBeth, John von Neumann, and Hermann Weyl, and has important parallels\nwith Prze\u0142\u0119cki (1969) and Dalla Chiara Scabia and Toraldo di\nFrancia (1973) (on the history of the approach see: Suppe 1977; van\nFraassen 1980, 65\u201367; Lorenzano 2013; advocates of the approach\ninclude: Beatty 1981; Giere 1988, 2004; Giere, Bickle, and Mauldin\n2006; Lloyd 1983, 1994 [1988], 2013 In Press; Suppe 1977, 1989;\nThompson, 1989, 2007; van Fraassen 1980, 1989, 2008; for alternative\nearly analyses of models see, e.g., Braithwaite 1962; Hesse 1966,\n1967). Interestingly, van Fraassen (1967, 1970) provides a potential\nreconstruction of state spaces via an analysis of\n\u201csemi-interpreted languages.\u201d Weisberg (2013), building on\nmany insights from Giere\u2019s work, presents a broad view of\nmodeling that includes mathematical structures that are\n\u201ctrajectories in state spaces\u201d (29), but also permits\nconcrete objects and computational structures such as algorithms to be\ndeemed models. Lorenzano (2013) calls Giere\u2019s (and, by\nextension, Weisberg\u2019s and even Godfrey-Smith\u2019s 2006)\napproach \u201cmodel-based,\u201d separating it out from the\nstate-space approach. A more fine-grained classification of the\nstate-space approach is desirable, particularly if we wish to\nunderstand important lessons stemming from the Pragmatic View of\nTheories, as we shall see below.\n\nAs an example of a state-space analysis of modeling, consider a\ncapsule traveling in outer space. An empirically and dynamically\nadequate mathematical model of the capsule\u2019s behavior would\ncapture the position of the capsule (i.e., three dimensions\nof the formal state space), as well as the velocity and\nacceleration vectors for each of the three standard spatial\ndimensions (i.e., six more dimensions in the formal state space). If\nthe mass were unknown or permitted to vary, we would have to add one\nmore dimension. Possible and actual trajectories of our capsule, with\nknown mass, within this abstract 9-dimensional state space could be\ninferred via Newtonian dynamical laws of motion (example in Lewontin\n1974, 6\u20138; consult Suppe 1989, 4). Importantly, under the\nstate-space approach, the interesting philosophical work of\ncharacterizing theory structure (e.g., as classes of models), theory\nmeaning (e.g., data models mapped to theoretical models), and theory\nfunction (e.g., explaining and predicting) happens at the level of\nmathematical models. \n3.1.2 The Set-/Model-Theoretic Approach\n\nLurking in the background of the state-space conception is the fact\nthat mathematics actually includes set theory and model\ntheory\u2014i.e., mathematical logic. Indeed, according to some\ninterlocutors, \u201cmetamathematics is part of mathematics\u201d\n(Halvorson 2012, 204). Historically, a set-/model-theoretic approach\nemerged from Tarski\u2019s work and was extensively articulated by\nSuppes and his associates (van Fraassen 1980, 67). Set theory is a\ngeneral language for formalizing mathematical structures as\ncollections\u2014i.e., sets\u2014of abstract objects (which can\nthemselves be relations or functions; see Krivine 2013 [1971]). Model\ntheory investigates the relations between, on the one hand, the formal\naxioms, theorems, and laws of a particular theory and, on the other\nhand, the mathematical structures\u2014the models\u2014that provide\nan interpretation of that theory, or put differently, that make the\ntheory\u2019s axioms, theorems, and laws true (Hodges 1997, Chapter\n2; Jones 2005). Interestingly, model theory often uses set theory\n(e.g., Marker 2002); set theory can, in turn, be extended to link\naxiomatic theories and semantic models via \u201cset-theoretical\npredicates\u201d (e.g., Suppes 1957, 2002). Finally, there are\ncertain hybrids of these two branches of mathematical logic, including\n\u201cpartial structures\u201d (e.g., da Costa and French 1990,\n2003; Bueno 1997; French 2017; French and Ladyman 1999, 2003; Vickers\n2009; Bueno, French, and Ladyman 2012). Lorenzano (2013) provides a\nmore complex taxonomy of the intellectual landscape of the Semantic\nView, including a discussion of Structuralism, a kind of\nset-/model-theoretic perspective. Structuralism involves theses about\n\u201ctheory-nets,\u201d theory-relative theoretical vs.\nnon-theoretical terms, a diversity of intra- and inter-theoretic laws\nwith different degrees of generality, a typology of inter-theoretic\nrelations, and a rich account of correspondence rules in scientific\npractice (see Moulines 2002; Pereda 2013; Schmidt 2014; Ladyman 2014).\nOn the whole, the set-/model-theoretic approach of the Semantic View\ninsists on the inseparability of metamathematics and mathematics. In\npreferring to characterize a theory axiomatically in terms of its\nintension rather than its extension, it shares the Syntactic\nView\u2019s aims of reconstructive axiomatization (e.g., Sneed 1979;\nStegm\u00fcller 1979; Frigg and Votsis 2011; Halvorson 2013, 2019;\nLutz 2012, 2014, 2017).\n\nAn example will help motivate the relation between theory and model.\nTwo qualifications are required: (i) we return to a more standard\nset-/model-theoretic illustration below, viz., McKinsey, Sugar, and\nSuppes\u2019 (1953) axiomatization of particle mechanics, and (ii)\nthis motivational example is not from the heartland of model theory\n(see Hodges 2013). Following van Fraassen\u2019s intuitive case of\n\u201cseven-point geometry\u201d (1980, 41\u201344; 1989,\n218\u2013220), also known as \u201cthe Fano plane\u201d we see how\na particular geometric figure, the model, interprets and\nmakes true a set of axioms and theorems, the theory. In\ntopology and geometry there is rich background theory regarding how to\nclose Euclidean planes and spaces to make finite geometries by, for\ninstance, eliminating parallel lines. Consider the axioms of a\nprojective plane:\n\nFor any two points, exactly one line lies on both.\nFor any two lines, exactly one point lies on both.\nThere exists a set of four points such that no line has more than\ntwo of them.\n\n\nA figure of a geometric model that makes this theory true is:\n\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nThis is the smallest geometrical model satisfying the three axioms of\nthe projective plane theory. Indeed, this example fits van\nFraassen\u2019s succinct characterization of the theory-model\nrelation:\n\nA model is called a model of a theory exactly if the theory is\nentirely true if considered with respect to this model alone.\n(Figuratively: the theory would be true if this model was the whole\nworld.) (1989, 218)\n\n\nThat is, if the entire universe consisted solely of these seven points\nand seven lines, the projective plane theory would be true. Of course,\nour universe is bigger. Because Euclidean geometry includes parallel\nlines, the Fano plane is not a model of Euclidean geometry. Even so,\nby drawing the plane, we have shown it to be isomorphic to\nparts of the Euclidean plane. In other words, the Fano plane has been\nembedded in a Euclidean plane. Below we return to the\nconcepts of embedding and isomorphism, but this example shall suffice\nfor now to indicate how a geometric model can provide a semantics for\nthe axioms of a theory.\n\nIn short, for the Semantic View the structure of a scientific theory\nis its class of mathematical models. According to some advocates of\nthis view, the family of models can itself be axiomatized, with those\nvery models (or other models) serving as axiom truth-makers. \n3.2 A Running Example: Newtonian Mechanics\n\nReturning to our running example, consider Suppes\u2019 1957\nmodel-theoretic articulation of particle mechanics, which builds on\nhis 1953 article with J.C.C. McKinsey and A.C. Sugar. Under this\nanalysis, there is a domain of set-theoretic objects of the form \\(\\{\nP, T, s, m, f, g \\}\\), where \\(P\\) and \\(T\\) are themselves sets,\n\\(s\\) and \\(g\\) are binary functions, \\(m\\) is a unary and \\(f\\) a\nternary function. \\(P\\) is the set of particles; \\(T\\) is a set of\nreal numbers measuring elapsed times; \\(s(p, t)\\) is the position of\nparticle \\(p\\) at time \\(t\\); \\(m(p)\\) is the mass of particle \\(p\\);\n\\(f(p, q, t)\\) is the force particle \\(q\\) exerts on \\(p\\) at time\n\\(t\\); and \\(g(p, t)\\) is the total resultant force (by all other\nparticles) on \\(p\\) at time \\(t\\). Suppes and his collaborators\ndefined seven axioms\u2014three kinematical and four\ndynamical\u2014characterizing Newtonian particle mechanics (see also\nSimon 1954, 1970). Such axioms include Newton\u2019s third law\nreconstructed in set-theoretic formulation thus (Suppes 1957,\n294): \n\n\\[\\tag{Axiom P5}\n\\text{For } p,q \\text{ in } P \\text{ and } t \\text{ in }T:\n f(p,q,t) = -f(q,p,t)\n\\]\n\n\nImportantly, the set-theoretic objects are found in more than one of\nthe axioms of the theory, and Newton\u2019s calculus is reconstructed\nin a novel, set-theoretic form. Set-theoretic predicates such as\n\u201cis a binary relation\u201d and \u201cis a function\u201d are\nalso involved in axiomatizing particle mechanics (Suppes 1957, 249).\nOnce these axioms are made explicit, their models can be specified and\nthese can, in turn, be applied to actual systems, thereby providing a\nsemantics for the axioms (e.g., as described in Section 3.3.1 below).\nA particular system satisfying these seven axioms is a particle\nmechanics system. (For an example of Newtonian mechanics from the\nstate-space approach, recall the space capsule of Section 3.1.1.)\n3.3 Interpreting Theory Structure per the Semantic View\n\nHow is the theory structure, described in Section 3.1, applied to\nempirical phenomena? How do we connect theory and data via observation\nand experimental and measuring techniques? The Semantic View\ndistinguishes theory individuation from both theory-phenomena and\ntheory-world relations. Three types of analysis of theory\ninterpretation are worth investigating: (i) a hierarchy of\nmodels (e.g., Suppes; Suppe), (ii) similarity (e.g.,\nGiere; Weisberg), and (iii) isomorphism (e.g., van Fraassen;\nFrench and Ladyman).\n3.3.1 A Hierarchy of Models\n\nOne way of analyzing theory structure interpretation is through a\nseries of models falling under the highest-level axiomatizations. This\nseries has been called \u201ca hierarchy of models,\u201d though it\nneed not be considered a nested hierarchy. These models include models\nof theory, models of experiment, and models of data (Suppes 1962,\n2002). Here is a summary of important parts of the hierarchy (Suppes\n1962, Table 1, 259; cf. Giere 2010, Figure 1, 270): \n\n Axioms of Theory. Axioms define set-theoretic\npredicates, and constitute the core structure of scientific theories,\nas reviewed in Section 3.1.2.\n Models of Theory. \u201cRepresentation Theorems,\u201d\npermit us \u201cto discover if an interesting subset of models for\nthe theory may be found such that any model for the theory is\nisomorphic to some member of this subset\u201d (Suppes 1957, 263).\nRepresentation theorem methodology can be extended (i) down the\nhierarchy, both to models of experiment and models of data, and (ii)\nfrom isomorphism to homomorphism (Suppes 2002, p. 57 ff.; Suppe 2000;\nCartwright 2008).\n Models of Experiment. Criteria of experimental design\nmotivate choices for how to set up and analyze experiments. There are\ncomplex mappings between models of experiment thus specified, and (i)\nmodels of theory, (ii) theories of measurement, and (iii) models of\ndata.\n Models of Data. In building models of data, phenomena\nare organized with respect to statistical goodness-of-fit tests and\nparameter estimation, in the context of models of theory. Choices\nabout which parameters to represent must be made.\n\n\nThe temptation to place phenomena at the bottom of the\nhierarchy must be resisted because phenomena permeate all levels.\nIndeed, the \u201cclass of phenomena\u201d pertinent to a scientific\ntheory is its \u201cintended scope\u201d (Suppe 1977, 223; Weisberg\n2013, 40). Furthermore, this temptation raises fundamental questions\nabout scientific representation: \u201cthere is the more profound\nissue of the relationship between the lower most representation in the\nhierarchy\u2014the data model perhaps\u2014and reality itself, but\nof course this is hardly something that the semantic approach alone\ncan be expected to address\u201d (French and Ladyman 1999, 113; cf.\nvan Fraassen 2008, 257\u2013258, \u201cThe \u2018link\u2019 to\nreality\u201d). Borrowing from David Chalmers, the \u201chard\nproblem\u201d of philosophy of science remains connecting abstract\nstructures to concrete phenomena, data, and world. \n3.3.2 Similarity\n\nThe similarity analysis of theory interpretation combines semantic and\npragmatic dimensions (Giere 1988, 2004, 2010; Giere, Bickle, and\nMauldin 2006; Weisberg 2013). According to Giere, interpretation is\nmediated by theoretical hypotheses positing representational relations\nbetween a model and relevant parts of the world. Such relations may be\nstated as follows: \n\n\\[\nS \\text{ uses } X \\text{ to represent } W \\text{ for purposes } P.\n\\]\n\n\nHere \\(S\\) is a scientist, research group or community, \\(W\\) is a\npart of the world, and \\(X\\) is, broadly speaking, any one of a\nvariety of models (Giere 2004, 743, 747, 2010). Model-world similarity\njudgments are conventional and intentional:\n\nNote that I am not saying that the model itself represents an aspect\nof the world because it is similar to that aspect. \u2026Anything is\nsimilar to anything else in countless respects, but not anything\nrepresents anything else. It is not the model that is doing the\nrepresenting; it is the scientist using the model who is doing the\nrepresenting. (2004, 747)\n\n\nRelatedly, Weisberg (2013) draws upon Tversky (1977) to develop a\nsimilarity metric for model interpretation (equation 8.10, 148). This\nmetric combines (i) model-target semantics (90\u201397), and (ii) the\npragmatics of \u201ccontext, conceptualization of the target, and the\ntheoretical goals of the scientist\u201d (149). Giere and Weisberg\nthus endorse an abundance of adequate mapping relations between a\ngiven model and the world. From this diversity, scientists and\nscientific communities must select particularly useful similarity\nrelationships for contextual modeling purposes. Because of semantic\npluralism and irreducible intentionality, this similarity analysis of\ntheory interpretation cannot be accommodated within a hierarchy of\nmodels approach, interpreted as a neat model nesting based on\npre-given semantic relations among models at different levels.\n3.3.3 Isomorphism\n\nThe term \u201cisomorphism\u201d is a composite of the Greek words\nfor \u201cequal\u201d and \u201cshape\u201d or \u201cform.\u201d\nIndeed, in mathematics, isomorphism is a perfect one-to-one, bijective\nmapping between two structures or sets. Figure (2) literally and\nfiguratively captures the term:\n\n\n\nFigure 2.\n\n\nEspecially in set theory, category theory, algebra, and topology,\nthere are various kinds of \u201c-morphisms,\u201d viz., of mapping\nrelations between two structures or models. Figure\n(3) indicates five different kinds of homomorphism, arranged in a Venn\ndiagram.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.\n\n\nAlthough philosophers have focused on isomorphism, other morphisms\nsuch as monomorphism (i.e., an injective homomorphism where some\nelements in the co-domain remain unmapped from the domain) might also\nbe interesting to investigate, especially for embedding data (i.e.,\nthe domain) into rich theoretical structures (i.e., the co-domain). To\ncomplete the visualization above, an epimorphism is a surjective\nhomomorphism, and an endomorphism is a mapping from a structure to\nitself, although it need not be a symmetrical\u2014i.e.,\ninvertible\u2014mapping, which would be an automorph. \n\nPerhaps the most avid supporter of isomorphism and embedding as the\nway to understand theory interpretation is van Fraassen. In a\nnutshell, if we distinguish (i) theoretical models, (ii)\n\u201cempirical substructures\u201d (van Fraassen 1980, 64, 1989,\n227; alternatively: \u201csurface models\u201d 2008, 168), and (iii)\n\u201cobservable phenomena\u201d (1989, 227, 2008, 168), then, van\nFraassen argues, theory interpretation is a relation of isomorphism\nbetween observable phenomena and empirical substructures, which are\nthemselves isomorphic with one or more theoretical models.\nMoreover, if a relation of isomorphism holds between \\(X\\) and a\nricher \\(Y\\), we say that we have embedded \\(X\\) in \\(Y\\). For\ninstance, with respect to the seven-point geometry above (Figure 1),\nvan Fraassen contends that isomorphism gives embeddability, and that\nthe relation of isomorphism \u201cis important because it is also the\nexact relation a phenomenon bears to some model or theory, if that\ntheory is empirically adequate\u201d (1989, 219\u201320; this kind\nof statement seems to be simultaneously descriptive and prescriptive\nabout scientific representation, see Section 1.1 above). In The\nScientific Image he is even clearer about fleshing out the\nempirical adequacy of a theory (with its theoretical models) in terms\nof isomorphism between \u201cappearances\u201d (i.e., \u201cthe\nstructures which can be described in experimental and measurement\nreports,\u201d 1980, 64, italics removed) and empirical\nsubstructures. Speaking metaphorically,\n\nthe phenomena are, from a theoretical point of view, small, arbitrary,\nand chaotic\u2014even nasty, brutish, and short\u2026\u2014but can\nbe understood as embeddable in beautifully simple but much larger\nmathematical models. (2008, 247; see also van Fraassen 1981, 666 and\n1989, 230)\n\n\nInterestingly, and as a defender of an identity strategy (see\nConclusion), Friedman also appeals to embedding and subsumption\nrelations between theory and phenomena in his analyses of theory\ninterpretation (Friedman 1981, 1983).\nBueno, da Costa, French, and Ladyman also employ embedding and\n(partial) isomorphism in the empirical interpretation of partial\nstructures (Bueno 1997; Bueno, French, and Ladyman 2012; da Costa and\nFrench 1990, 2003; French 2017; French and Ladyman 1997, 1999, 2003;\nLadyman 2004). Su\u00e1rez discusses complexities in van\nFraassen\u2019s analyses of scientific representation and theory\ninterpretation (Su\u00e1rez 1999, 2011). On the one hand,\nrepresentation is structural identity between the theoretical and the\nempirical. On the other hand, \u201cThere is no representation except\nin the sense that some things are used, made, or taken, to represent\nsome things as thus or so\u201d (van Fraassen 2008, 23, italics\nremoved). The reader interested in learning how van Fraassen\nsimultaneously endorses acontextually structural and contextually\npragmatic aspects of representation and interpretation should refer to\nvan Fraassen\u2019s (2008) investigations of maps and \u201cthe\nessential indexical.\u201d [To complement the structure vs. function\ndistinction, see van Fraassen 2008, 309\u2013311 for a structure\n(\u201cstructural relations\u201d) vs. history (\u201cthe\nintellectual processes that lead to those models\u201d) distinction;\ncf. Ladyman et al. 2011] In all of this, embedding via isomorphism is\na clear contender for theory interpretation under the Semantic\nView.\n3.4 Taking Stock: Semantic View\n\nIn short, committing to either a state-space or a set-/model-theoretic\nview on theory structure does not imply any particular perspective on\ntheory interpretation (e.g., hierarchy of models, similarity,\nembedding). Instead, commitments to the former are logically and\nactually separable from positions on the latter (e.g., Suppes and\nSuppe endorse different accounts of theory structure, but share an\nunderstanding of theory interpretation in terms of a hierarchy of\nmodels). The Semantic View is alive and well as a family of analyses\nof theory structure, and continues to be developed in interesting ways\nboth in its state-space and set-/model-theoretic approaches. \n4. The Pragmatic View\n\nThe Pragmatic View recognizes that a number of assumptions about\nscientific theory seem to be shared by the Syntactic and Semantic\nViews. Both perspectives agree, very roughly, that theory is (1)\nexplicit, (2) mathematical, (3) abstract, (4) systematic, (5) readily\nindividualizable, (6) distinct from data and experiment, and (7)\nhighly explanatory and predictive (see Flyvbjerg 2001, 38\u201339;\ncf. Dreyfus 1986). The Pragmatic View imagines the structure of\nscientific theories rather differently, arguing for a variety of\ntheses:\n\n Limitations. Idealized theory structure might be too\nweak to ground the predictive and explanatory work syntacticists and\nsemanticists expect of it (e.g., Cartwright 1983, 1999a, b, 2019;\nMorgan and Morrison 1999; Su\u00e1rez and Cartwright 2008). \n Pluralism. Theory structure is plural and complex both\nin the sense of internal variegation and of existing in many types. In\nother words, there is an internal pluralism of theory (and\nmodel) components (e.g., mathematical concepts, metaphors, analogies,\nontological assumptions, values, natural kinds and classifications,\ndistinctions, and policy views, e.g., Kuhn 1970; Boumans 1999), as\nwell as a broad external pluralism of different types of\ntheory (and models) operative in science (e.g., mechanistic,\nhistorical, and mathematical models, e.g., Hacking 2009, Longino 2013). Indeed, it may be better to speak of the structures of\nscientific theories, in the double-plural.\n Nonformal aspects. The internal pluralism of theory\nstructure (thesis #2) includes many nonformal aspects deserving\nattention. That is, many components of theory structure, such as\nmetaphors, analogies, values, and policy views have a non-mathematical\nand \u201cinformal\u201d nature, and they lie implicit or hidden\n(e.g., Bailer-Jones 2002; Craver 2002; Contessa 2006; Morgan 2012). Interestingly, the common understanding of\n\u201cformal,\u201d which identifies formalization with\nmathematization, may itself be a conceptual straightjacket; the term\ncould be broadened to include \u201cdiagram abstraction\u201d and\n\u201cprinciple extraction\u201d (e.g., Griesemer 2013, who\nexplicitly endorses what he also calls a \u201cPragmatic View of\nTheories\u201d).\n Function. Characterizations of the nature and dynamics\nof theory structure should pay attention to the user as well as to\npurposes and values (e.g., Apostel 1960; Minsky 1965; Morrison 2007;\nWinther 2012a).\n Practice. Theory structure is continuous with practice\nand \u201cthe experimental life,\u201d making it difficult to neatly\ndichotomize theory and practice (e.g., Hacking 1983, 2009; Shapin and\nSchaffer 1985; Galison 1987, 1988, 1997; Su\u00e1rez and Cartwright\n2008, Cartwright 2019).\n\n\nThese are core commitments of the Pragmatic View.\n\nIt is important to note at the outset that the Pragmatic View takes\nits name from the linguistic trichotomy discussed above, in the\nIntroduction. This perspective need not imply commitment to, or\nassociation with, American Pragmatism (e.g. the work of Charles S.\nPeirce, William James, or John Dewey; cf. Hookway 2013; Richardson\n2002). For instance, Hacking (2007a) distinguishes his pragmatic\nattitudes from the school of Pragmatism. He maps out alternative\nhistorical routes of influence, in general and on him,\nvis-\u00e0-vis fallibilism (via Imre Lakatos, Karl Popper; Hacking\n2007a, \u00a71), historically conditioned truthfulness (via Bernard\nWilliams; Hacking 2007a, \u00a73), and realism as intervening (via\nFrancis Everitt, Melissa Franklin; Hacking 2007a, \u00a74). To borrow\na term from phylogenetics, the Pragmatic View is\n\u201cpolyphyletic.\u201d The components of its analytical framework\nhave multiple, independent origins, some of which circumnavigate\nAmerican Pragmatism.\n\nWith this qualification and the five theses above in mind, let us now\nturn to the Pragmatic View\u2019s analysis of theory structure and\ntheory interpretation.\n4.1 Theory Structure per the Pragmatic View\n\nWe should distinguish two strands of the Pragmatic View: the\nPragmatic View of Models and a proper Pragmatic View of\nTheories. \n4.1.1 The Pragmatic View of Models\n\nNancy Cartwright\u2019s How the Laws of Physics Lie\ncrystallized the Pragmatic View of Models. Under Cartwright\u2019s\nanalysis, models are the appropriate level of investigation for\nphilosophers trying to understand science. She argues for significant\nlimitations of theory (thesis #1), claiming that laws of nature are\nrarely true, and are epistemically weak. Theory as a collection of\nlaws cannot, therefore, support the many kinds of inferences and\nexplanations that we have come to expect it to license. Cartwright\nurges us to turn to models and modeling, which are central to\nscientific practice. Moreover, models\n\u201clie\u201d\u2014figuratively and literally\u2014between\ntheory and the world (cf. Derman 2011). That is, \u201cto explain a\nphenomenon is to find a model that fits it into the basic framework of\nthe theory and that thus allows us to derive analogues for the messy\nand complicated phenomenological laws which are true of it.\u201d A\nplurality of models exist, and models \u201cserve a variety of\npurposes\u201d (Cartwright 1983, 152; cf. Suppes 1978). Cartwright is\ninterested in the practices and purposes of scientific models, and\nasks us to focus on models rather than theories.\n\nCartwright\u2019s insights into model pluralism and model practices\nstand as a significant contribution of \u201cThe Stanford\nSchool\u201d (cf. Cat 2014), and were further developed by the\n\u201cmodels as mediators\u201d group, with participants at LSE,\nUniversity of Amsterdam, and University of Toronto (Morgan and\nMorrison 1999; Chang 2011; cf. Mart\u00ednez 2003). This group\ninsisted on the internal pluralism of model components (thesis #2).\nAccording to Morgan and Morrison, building a model involves\n\u201cfitting together\u2026 bits which come from disparate\nsources,\u201d including \u201cstories\u201d (Morgan and Morrison\n1999, 15). Boumans (1999) writes:\n\n\nmodel building is like baking a cake without a recipe. The ingredients\nare theoretical ideas, policy views, mathematisations of the cycle,\nmetaphors and empirical facts. (67)\n\nMathematical moulding is shaping the ingredients in such a\nmathematical form that integration is possible\u2026 (90)\n\n\nIn an instructive diagram, Boumans suggests that a variety of factors\nbesides theory and data feed into a model: metaphors, analogies,\npolicy views, stylised facts, mathematical techniques, and\nmathematical concepts (93). The full range of components involved in a\nmodel will likely vary according to discipline, and with respect to\nexplanations and interventions sought (e.g., analogies but not policy\nviews will be important in theoretical physics). In short, model\nbuilding involves a complex variety of internal nonformal aspects,\nsome of which are implicit (theses #2 and #3).\n\nAs one example of a nonformal component of model construction and\nmodel structure, consider metaphors and analogies (e.g., Bailer-Jones\n2002). Geary (2011) states the \u201csimplest equation\u201d of\nmetaphor thus: \u201c\\(X = Y\\)\u201d (8, following Aristotle:\n\u201cMetaphor consists in giving the thing a name that belongs to\nsomething else\u2026 ,\u201d Poetics, 1457b). The line\nbetween metaphor and analogy in science is blurry. Some interlocutors\nsynonymize them (e.g., Hoffman 1980; Brown 2003), others reduce one to\nthe other (analogy is a form of metaphor, Geary 2011; metaphor is a\nkind of analogy, Gentner 1982, 2003), and yet others bracket one to\nfocus on the other (e.g., Oppenheimer 1956 sets aside metaphor). One\nway to distinguish them is to reserve \u201canalogy\u201d for\nconcrete comparisons, with clearly identifiable and demarcated source\nand target domains, and with specific histories, and use\n\u201cmetaphor\u201d for much broader and indeterminate comparisons,\nwith diffuse trajectories across discourses. Analogies include the\n\u201clines of force\u201d of electricity and magnetism (Maxwell and\nFaraday), the atom as a planetary system (Rutherford and Bohr), the\nbenzene ring as a snake biting its own tail (Kekul\u00e9),\nDarwin\u2019s \u201cnatural selection\u201d and \u201centangled\nbank,\u201d and behavioral \u201cdrives\u201d (Tinbergen) (e.g.,\nHesse 1966, 1967; Bartha 2010). Examples of metaphor are\ngenetic information, superorganism, and networks (e.g., Keller 1995).\nMore could be said about other informal model components, but this\ndiscussion of metaphors and analogies shall suffice to hint at how\nmodels do not merely lie between theory and world. Models express a\nrich internal pluralism (see also de Chadarevian and Hopwood 2004;\nMorgan 2012). \n\nModel complexity can also be seen in the external plurality of models\n(thesis #2). Not all models are mathematical, or even ideally recast\nas mathematical. Non-formalized (i.e., non\u2013state-space,\nnon-set-/model-theoretic) models such as physical, diagrammatic,\nmaterial, historical, \u201cremnant,\u201d and fictional models are\nubiquitous across the sciences (e.g., Frigg and Hartmann 2012; for the\nbiological sciences, see Hull 1975; Beatty 1980; Griesemer 1990, 1991\na, b, 2013; Downes 1992; Richards 1992; Winther 2006a; Leonelli\n2008; Weisberg 2013). Moreover, computer simulations differ in\nimportant respects from more standard analytical mathematical models\n(e.g., Smith 1996; Winsberg 2010; Weisberg 2013). According to some\n(e.g., Griesemer 2013; Downes 1992; Godfrey-Smith 2006; Thomson-Jones\n2012), this diversity belies claims by semanticists that models can\nalways be cast \u201cinto set theoretic terms\u201d (Lloyd 2013 In\nPress), are \u201calways a mathematical structure\u201d (van\nFraassen 1970, 327), or that \u201cformalisation of a theory is an\nabstract representation of the theory expressed in a formal deductive\nframework\u2026 in first-order predicate logic with identity, in set\ntheory, in matrix algebra and indeed, any branch of\nmathematics...\u201d (Thompson 2007, 485\u20136). Even so, internal\npluralism has been interpreted as supporting a \u201cdeflationary\nsemantic view,\u201d which is minimally committed to the perspective\nthat \u201cmodel construction is an important part of scientific\ntheorizing\u201d (Downes 1992, 151). Given the formal and\nmathematical framework of the Semantic View (see above), however, the\nbroad plurality of kinds of models seems to properly belong under a\nPragmatic View of Models.\n4.1.2 The Pragmatic View of Theories\n\nInterestingly, while critiquing the Syntactic and Semantic Views on\nmost matters, the Pragmatic View of Models construed theory, the\nprocess of theorizing, and the structure of scientific theories,\naccording to terms set by the two earlier views. For instance,\nCartwright tends to conceive of theory as explicit, mathematical,\nabstract, and so forth (see the first paragraph of Section 4). She\nalways resisted \u201cthe traditional syntactic/semantic view of\ntheory\u201d for its \u201cvending machine\u201d view, in which a\ntheory is a deductive and automated machine that upon receiving\nempirical input \u201cgurgitates\u201d and then \u201cdrops out the\nsought-for representation\u201d (1999a, 184\u20135). Rather than\nreform Syntactic and Semantic accounts of theory and theory structure,\nhowever, she invites us, as we just saw, to think of science as\nmodeling, \u201cwith theory as one small component\u201d\n(Cartwright, Shomar, and Su\u00e1rez 1995, 138; Su\u00e1rez and\nCartwright 2008). Many have followed her. Kitcher\u2019s predilection\nis also to accept the terms of the Syntactic and Semantic Views. For\ninstance, he defines theories as \u201caxiomatic deductive\nsystems\u201d (1993, 93). In a strategy complementary to\nCartwright\u2019s modeling turn, Kitcher encourages us to focus on\npractice, including practices of modeling and even practices of\ntheorizing. In The Advancement of Science, practice is\nanalyzed as a 7-tuple, with the following highly abbreviated\ncomponents: (i) a language; (ii) questions; (iii) statements\n(pictures, diagrams); (iv) explanatory patterns; (v) standard\nexamples; (vi) paradigms of experimentation and observation, plus\ninstruments and tools; and (vii) methodology (Kitcher 1993, 74).\nScientific practice is also center stage for those singing the praises\nof \u201cthe experimental life\u201d (e.g., Hacking 1983; Shapin and\nSchaffer 1985; Galison 1987), and those highlighting the cognitive\ngrounds of science (e.g., Giere 1988; Mart\u00ednez 2014) and\nscience\u2019s social and normative context (e.g., Kitcher 1993,\n2001; Longino 1995, 2002; Ziman 2000; cf. Simon 1957). Indeed, the\nmodeling and practice turns in the philosophy of science were\nreasonable reactions to the power of axiomatic reconstructive and\nmathematical modeling analyses of the structure of scientific\ntheories. \n\nYet, a Pragmatic View of Theories is also afoot, one\nresisting orthodox characterizations of theory often embraced, at\nleast early on, by Pragmatic View philosophers such as Cartwright,\nHacking, Kitcher, and Longino. For instance, Craver (2002) accepts\nboth the Syntactic and Semantic Views, which he humorously and not\ninaccurately calls \u201cthe Once Received View\u201d and the\n\u201cModel Model View.\u201d But he also observes:\n\nWhile these analyses have advanced our understanding of some formal\naspects of theories and their uses, they have neglected or obscured\nthose aspects dependent upon nonformal patterns in theories.\nProgress can be made in understanding scientific theories by attending\nto their diverse nonformal patterns and by identifying the axes along\nwhich such patterns might differ from one another. (55)\n\n\nCraver then turns to mechanistic theory as a third theory type (and a\nthird philosophical analysis of theory structure) that highlights\nnonformal patterns:\n\nDifferent types of mechanisms can be distinguished on the basis of\nrecurrent patterns in their organization. Mechanisms may be organized\nin series, in parallel, or in cycles. They may contain branches and\njoins, and they often include feedback and feedforward subcomponents.\n(71)\n\n\nConsistent with theses #2 and #3 of the Pragmatic View, we must\nrecognize the internal pluralism of theories as including nonformal\ncomponents. Some of these are used to represent organizational and\ncompositional relations of complex systems (Craver 2007; Wimsatt 2007; Winther 2011; Walsh 2015). While mechanistic analyses such as\nCraver\u2019s may not wish to follow every aspect of the Pragmatic\nView of Theories, there are important and deep resonances between the\ntwo.\n\nIn a review of da Costa and French (2003), Contessa (2006) writes:\n\nPhilosophers of science are increasingly realizing that the\ndifferences between the syntactic and the semantic view are less\nsignificant than semanticists would have it and that, ultimately,\nneither is a suitable framework within which to think about scientific\ntheories and models. The crucial divide in philosophy of science, I\nthink, is not the one between advocates of the syntactic view and\nadvocates of the semantic view, but the one between those who think\nthat philosophy of science needs a formal framework or other and those\nwho think otherwise. (376)\n\n\nAgain, we are invited to develop a non-formal framework of science and\npresumably also of scientific theory. (Halvorson 2012, 203 takes\nContessa 2006 to task for advocating \u201cinformal philosophy of\nscience.\u201d) Moreover, in asking \u201cwhat should the content of\na given theory be taken to be on a given occasion?\u201d, Vickers\n(2009) answers:\n\nIt seems clear that, in addition to theories being vague objects in\nthe way that \u2018heaps\u2019 of sand are, there will be\nfundamentally different ways to put together theoretical assumptions\ndepending on the particular investigation one is undertaking. For\nexample, sometimes it will be more appropriate to focus on the\nassumptions which were used by scientists, rather than the\nones that were believed to be true. (247, footnote\nsuppressed)\n\n\nA Pragmatic View of Theories helps make explicit nonformal internal\ncomponents of theory structure. \n\nKey early defenders of the modeling and practice turns have also\nrecently begun to envision theory in a way distinct from the terms set\nby the Syntactic and Semantic Views. Su\u00e1rez and Cartwright\n(2008) extend and distribute theory by arguing that \u201cWhat we\nknow \u2018theoretically\u2019 is recorded in a vast number of\nplaces in a vast number of different ways\u2014not just in words and\nformulae but in machines, techniques, experiments and applications as\nwell\u201d (79). And while her influence lies primarily in the\nmodeling turn, even in characterizing the \u201cvending\nmachine\u201d view, Cartwright calls for a \u201creasonable\nphilosophical account of theories\u201d that is \u201cmuch more\ntextured, and\u2026 much more laborious\u201d than that adopted by\nthe Syntactic and Semantic Views (1999a, 185). The theory-data and\ntheory-world axes need to be rethought. In her 2019 book on\n\u201cartful modeling\u201d, Cartwright emphasizes the importance of\nknow-how and creativity in scientific practice, and \u201cpraise[s]\nengineers and cooks and inventors, as well as experimental physicists\nlike Millikan and Melissa Franklin\u201d (Cartwright 2019, 76).\nKitcher wishes to transform talk of theories into discussion of\n\u201csignificance graphs\u201d (2001, 78 ff.). These are network\ndiagrams illustrating which (and how) questions are considered\nsignificant in the context of particular scientific communities and\nnorms (cf. Brown 2010). Consistently with a Pragmatic View of\nTheories, Morrison (2007) reconsiders and reforms canonical\nconceptualizations of \u201ctheory.\u201d Finally, Longino (2013)\nproposes an archaeology of assumptions behind and under different\nresearch programs and theories of human behavior such as\nneurobiological, molecular behavioral genetic, and\nsocial-environmental approaches (e.g., Oyama 2000). For instance, two\nshared or recurring assumptions across programs and theories are:\n\n(1) that the approach in question has methods of measuring both the\nbehavioral outcome that is the object of investigation and the factors\nwhose association with it are the topic of investigation and (2) that\nthe resulting measurements are exportable beyond the confines of the\napproach within which they are made. (Longino 2013, 117)\n\n\nA Pragmatic View of Theories expands the notion of theory to include\nnonformal aspects, which surely must include elements from\nBoumans\u2019 list above (e.g., metaphors, analogies, policy views),\nas well as more standard components such as ontological assumptions\n(e.g., Kuhn 1970; Levins and Lewontin 1985; Winther 2006b), natural\nkinds (e.g., Hacking 2007b), and conditions of application or scope\n(e.g., Longino 2013).\n\nIn addition to exploring internal theory diversity and in parallel\nwith plurality of modeling, a Pragmatic View of Theories could also\nexplore pluralism of modes of theorizing, and of philosophically\nanalyzing theoretical structure (thesis #2). Craver (2002) provides a\nstart in this direction in that he accepts three kinds of scientific\ntheory and of philosophical analysis of scientific theory. A more\nsynoptic view of the broader pragmatic context in which theories are\nembedded can be found in the literature on different\n\u201cstyles\u201d of scientific reasoning and theorizing (e.g.,\nCrombie 1994, 1996; Vicedo 1995; Pickstone 2000; Davidson 2001;\nHacking 2002, 2009; Winther 2012b; Elwick 2007; Mancosu\n2010). While there is no univocal or dominant classification of\nstyles, two lessons are important. First, a rough consensus exists\nthat theoretical investigations of especially historical, mechanistic,\nand mathematical structures and relations will involve different\nstyles. Second, each style integrates theoretical products and\ntheorizing processes in unique ways, thus inviting an irreducible\npragmatic methodological pluralism in our philosophical analysis of\nthe structure of scientific theories. For instance, the structure of\ntheories of mechanisms in molecular biology or neuroscience involves\nflow charts, and is distinct from the\nstructure of theories of historical processes and patterns as found in\nsystematics and phylogenetics, which involves phylogenetic trees. As Crombie suggests, we need a\n\u201ccomparative historical anthropology of thinking.\u201d (1996,\n71; see Hacking 2009) Mathematical theory hardly remains regnant. It\ngives way to a pluralism of theory forms and theory processes. Indeed,\neven mathematical theorizing is a pluralistic motley, as Hacking\n(2014) argues. Although a \u201cdeflationary\u201d Semantic View\ncould account for pluralism of theory forms, the Pragmatic View of\nTheories, drawing on styles, is required to do justice to the immense\nvariety of theorizing processes, and of philosophical accounts of\ntheory and theory structure. \n\nFinally, outstanding work remains in sorting out the philosophical\nutility of a variety of proposed units in addition to styles, such as\nKuhn\u2019s (1970) paradigms, Lakatos\u2019 (1980) research\nprogrammes, Laudan\u2019s (1977) research traditions, and\nHolton\u2019s (1988) themata. A rational comparative historical\nanthropology of both theorizing and philosophical analyses of\ntheorizing remains mostly unmapped (cf. Matheson and Dallmann 2014).\nSuch a comparative meta-philosophical analysis should also address\nDavidson\u2019s (1974) worries about \u201cconceptual schemes\u201d\nand Popper\u2019s (1996 [1976]) critique of \u201cthe myth of the\nframework\u201d (see Hacking 2002; Godfrey-Smith 2003).\n4.2 A Running Example: Newtonian Mechanics\n\nCartwright has done much to develop a Pragmatic View. Start by\nconsidering Newton\u2019s second law: \n\n\\[\\tag{1}\nF = ma\n\\]\n\n\nHere \\(F\\) is the resultant force on a mass \\(m\\), and \\(a\\) is the\nnet acceleration of \\(m\\); both \\(F\\) and \\(a\\) are vectors. This law\nis considered a \u201cgeneral\u201d (Cartwright 1999a, 187) law\nexpressed with \u201cabstract quantities\u201d (Cartwright 1999b,\n249). Newton\u2019s second law can be complemented with other laws,\nsuch as (i) Hooke\u2019s law for an ideal spring: \n\n\\[\\tag{2}\nF = -kx\n\\]\n\n\nHere \\(k\\) is the force constant of the spring, and \\(x\\) the distance\nalong the x-axis from the equilibrium position, and (ii)\nCoulomb\u2019s law modeling the force between two charged\nparticles: \n\n\\[\\tag{3}\nF = K \\frac{qq'}{r^2}\n\\]\n\n\nHere \\(K\\) is Coulomb\u2019s electrical constant, \\(q\\) and \\(q'\\)\nare the charges of the two objects, and \\(r\\) the distance between the\ntwo objects. The picture Cartwright draws for us is that\nNewton\u2019s, Hooke\u2019s, and Coulomb\u2019s laws are abstract,\nleaving out many details. They can be used to derive mathematical\nmodels of concrete systems. For instance, by combining (1) and (2),\nthe law of gravitation (a \u201cfundamental\u201d law, Cartwright\n1983, 58\u201359), other source laws, and various simplifying\nassumptions, we might create a model for the orbit of Mars, treating\nthe Sun and Mars as a 2-body system, ignoring the other planets,\nasteroids, and Mars\u2019 moons. Indeed, the Solar System is a\npowerful \u201cnomological machine\u201d (Cartwright 1999a,\n50\u201353), which \u201cis a fixed (enough) arrangement of\ncomponents, or factors, with stable (enough) capacities that in the\nright sort of stable (enough) environment will, with repeated\noperation, give rise to the kind of regular behaviour that we\nrepresent in our scientific laws\u201d (Cartwright 1999a, 50).\nImportantly, most natural systems are complex and irregular, and\ncannot be neatly characterized as nomological machines. For these\ncases, abstract laws \u201crun out\u201d (Cartwright 1983) and are\nrarely smoothly \u201cdeidealised\u201d (Su\u00e1rez 1999). In\ngeneral, abstract laws predict and explain only within a given domain\nof application, and only under ideal conditions. More concrete laws or\nmodels are not directly deduced from them (e.g., Su\u00e1rez 1999,\nSu\u00e1rez and Cartwright 2008), and they can rarely be combined to\nform effective \u201csuper-laws\u201d (Cartwright 1983,\n70\u201373). In short, the move from (1) and (2) or from (1) and (3)\nto appropriate phenomenological models, is not fully specified by\neither abstract law pairing. Indeed, Cartwright developed her notion\nof \u201ccapacities\u201d to discuss how \u201cthe principles of\nphysics\u201d \u201care far better rendered as claims about\ncapacities, capacities that can be assembled and reassembled in\ndifferent nomological machines, unending in their variety, to give\nrise to different laws\u201d (1999a, 52). Articulating concrete\nmodels requires integrating a mix of mathematical and nonformal\ncomponents. Laws (1), (2), and (3) remain only one component, among\nmany, of the models useful for, e.g., exploring the behavior of the\nSolar System, balls on a pool table, or the behavior of charges in\nelectrical fields.\n\nShifting examples but not philosophical research program,\nSu\u00e1rez and Cartwright (2008) explains how analogies such as\nsuperconductors as diamagnets (as opposed to ferromagnets) were an\nintegral part of the mathematical model of superconductivity developed\nby Fritz and Heinz London in the 1930s (63; cf. London and London\n1935). Su\u00e1rez and Cartwright gladly accept that this model\n\u201cis uncontroversially grounded in classic electromagnetic\ntheory\u201d (64). However, contra Semantic View Structuralists such\nas Bueno, da Costa, French, and Ladyman, they view nonformal aspects\nas essential to practices of scientific modeling and theorizing:\n\u201cThe analogy [of diamagnets] helps us to understand how the\nLondons work with their model\u2026 which assumptions they add and\nwhich not\u2026 a formal reconstruction of the model on its own\ncannot help us to understand that\u201d (69). In short, the running\nexample of Newtonian mechanics, in conjunction with a glimpse into the\nuse of analogies in mathematical modeling, illustrates the Pragmatic\nView\u2019s account of theory syntax: theory is constituted by a\nplurality of formal and informal components.\n4.3 Interpreting Theory Structure per the Pragmatic View\n\nAs we have explored throughout this section, models and theories have\ninformal internal components, and there are distinct modes of modeling\nand theorizing. Because of the Pragmatic View\u2019s attention to\npractice, function, and application, distinguishing structure\nfrom interpretation is more difficult here than under the\nSyntactic and Semantic Views. Any synchronic analysis of the structure\nof models and theories must respect intentional diachronic processes\nof interpreting and using, as we shall now see.\n\nRegarding the import of function in models and theories (thesis #4),\nalready the Belgian philosopher of science Apostel defined modeling\nthus: \u201cLet then \\(R(S,P,M,T)\\) indicate the main variables of\nthe modelling relationship. The subject \\(S\\) takes, in view of the\npurpose \\(P\\), the entity \\(M\\) as a model for the prototype\n\\(T\\)\u201d (1960, 128, see also Apostel 1970). Purposes took\ncenter-stage in his article title: \u201cTowards the Formal Study of\nModels in the Non-Formal Sciences.\u201d MIT Artificial Intelligence\ntrailblazer Minsky also provided a pragmatic analysis:\n\nWe use the term \u201cmodel\u201d in the following sense: To an\nobserver \\(B\\), an object \\(A^*\\) is a model of an object \\(A\\) to the\nextent that \\(B\\) can use \\(A^*\\) to answer questions that interest\nhim about \\(A\\). The model relation is inherently ternary. Any\nattempt to suppress the role of the intentions of the investigator\n\\(B\\) leads to circular definitions or to ambiguities about\n\u201cessential features\u201d and the like. (1965, 45)\n\n\nThis account is thoroughly intentionalist and anti-essentialist. That\nis, mapping relations between model and world are left open and\noverdetermined. Specifying the relevant relations depends on\ncontextual factors such as questions asked, and the kinds of\nsimilarities and isomorphisms deemed to be of interest. The\nappropriate relations are selected from an infinite (or, at least,\nnear-infinite) variety of possible relations (e.g., Rosenblueth and\nWiener 1945; Lowry 1965).\n\nRegarding practice (thesis #5), in addition to ample work on the\nexperimental life mentioned above, consider a small example. A full\nunderstanding of the content and structure of the London\nbrothers\u2019 model of superconductivity requires attention to\ninformal aspects such as analogies. Even London and London (1935)\nstate in the summary of their paper that \u201cthe current [\u201din\na supraconductor\u201c] is characterized as a kind of diamagnetic\nvolume current\u201d (88). They too saw the diamagnetic analogy as\ncentral to their theoretical practices. Criteria and practices of\ntheory confirmation also differ from the ones typical of the Syntactic\nand Semantic Views. While predictive and explanatory power as well as\nempirical adequacy remain important, the Pragmatic View also insists\non a variety of other justificatory criteria, including pragmatic\nvirtues (sensu Kuhn 1977; Longino 1995) such as fruitfulness and\nutility. In a nutshell, the Pragmatic View argues that scientific\ntheory structure is deeply shaped and constrained by functions and\npractices, and that theory can be interpreted and applied validly\naccording to many different criteria.\n4.4 Taking Stock: Pragmatic View\n\nThe analytical framework of the Pragmatic View remains under\nconstruction. The emphasis is on internal diversity, and on the\nexternal pluralism of models and theories, of modeling and theorizing,\nand of philosophical analyses of scientific theories. The Pragmatic\nView acknowledges that scientists use and need different kinds of\ntheories for a variety of purposes. There is no one-size-fits-all\nstructure of scientific theories. Notably, although the Pragmatic View\ndoes not necessarily endorse the views of the tradition of American\nPragmatism, it has important resonances with the latter school\u2019s\nemphasis on truth and knowledge as processual, purposive, pluralist,\nand context-dependent, and on the social and cognitive structure of\nscientific inquiry.\n\nA further qualification in addition to the one above regarding\nAmerican Pragmatism is in order. The Pragmatic View has important\nprecursors in the historicist or \u201cworld view\u201d perspectives\nof Feyerabend, Hanson, Kuhn, and Toulmin, which were an influential\nset of critiques of the Syntactic View utterly distinct from the\nSemantic View. This philosophical tradition focused on themes such as\nmeaning change and incommensurability of terms across world views\n(e.g., paradigms), scientific change (e.g., revolutionary: Kuhn 1970;\nevolutionary: Toulmin 1972), the interweaving of context of discovery\nand context of justification, and scientific rationality (Preston\n2012; Bird 2013; Swoyer 2014). The historicists also opposed the idea\nthat theories can secure meaning and empirical support from a\ntheory-neutral and purely observational source, as the Syntactic View\nhad insisted on with its strong distinction between theoretical and\nobservational vocabularies (cf. Galison 1988). Kuhn\u2019s paradigms\nor, more precisely, \u201cdisciplinary matrices\u201d even had an\ninternal anatomy with four components: (i) laws or symbolic\ngeneralizations, (ii) ontological assumptions, (iii) values, and (iv)\nexemplars (Kuhn 1970, postscript; Godfrey-Smith 2003; Hacking 2012).\nThis work was concerned more with theory change than with theory\nstructure and had fewer conceptual resources from sociology of science\nand history of science than contemporary Pragmatic View work.\nMoreover, paradigms never quite caught on the way analyses of models\nand modeling have. Even so, this work did much to convince later\nscholars, including many of the Pragmatic View, of certain weaknesses\nin understanding theories as deductive axiomatic structures.\n5. Population Genetics\n\nAs a final way to contrast the three views, we return to population\ngenetics and, especially, to the Hardy-Weinberg Principle (HWP). Both\nWoodger (1937, 1959) and Williams (1970, 1973) provide detailed\naxiomatizations of certain parts of biology, especially genetics,\ndevelopmental biology, and phylogenetics. For instance, Woodger (1937)\nconstructs an axiomatic system based on ten logical predicates or\nrelations, including \\(\\bP\\) (part of), \\(\\bT\\) (before\nin time), \\(\\bU\\) (reproduced by cell division or cell\nfusion), \\(\\bm\\) (male gamete), \\(\\bff\\) (female\ngamete), and \\(\\bgenet\\) (genetic property) (cf.\nNicholson and Gawne 2014). Woodger (1959) elaborates these logical\npredicates or relations to produce a careful reconstruction of\nMendelian genetics. Here are two axioms in his system (which are\nrewritten in contemporary notation, since Woodger used Russell and\nWhitehead\u2019s Principia Mathematica notation):\n\n\\[\n(m \\wedge f) = \\varnothing\n\\]\n\n \n\n\\[\n\\forall x,y,z,u,v (DLZxyz \\wedge DLZuvz) \\rightarrow \n  (x=u) \\wedge (y=z)\n\\]\n\n\nThe first axiom should be read thus: \u201cno gamete is both male and\nfemale\u201d (1959, 416). In the second axiom, given that \\(DLZxyz\\)\nis a primitive relation defined as \u201c\\(x\\) is a zygote which\ndevelops in the environment \\(y\\) into the life \\(z\\)\u201d (1959,\n415), the translation is \u201cevery life develops in one and only\none environment from one and only one zygote\u201d (416). Woodger\nclaims that \u201cthe whole of Mendel\u2019s work can be\nexpressed\u2026\u201d via this axiomatic system. Woodger briefly\nmentions that if one assumes that the entire system or population is\nrandom with respect to gamete fusions, \u201cthen the Pearson-Hardy\nlaw is derivable\u201d (1959, 427). This was a reference to HWP. In\nher explorations of various axiomatizations of Darwinian lineages and\n\u201csubclans,\u201d and the process of the \u201cexpansion of the\nfitter,\u201d Williams (1970, 1973) also carefully defines concepts,\nand axiomatizes basic biological principles of reproduction, natural\nselection, fitness, and so forth. However, she does not address HWP.\nOf interest is the lack of axiomatization of HWP or other mathematical\nprinciples of population genetics in Woodger\u2019s and\nWilliams\u2019 work. Were such principles considered secondary or\nuninteresting by Woodger and Williams? Might Woodger\u2019s and\nWilliams\u2019 respective axiomatic systems simply lack the power and\nconceptual resources to axiomatically reconstruct a mathematical\nedifice actually cast in terms of probability theory? Finally, other\nfriends of the Syntactic View, such as the early Michael Ruse, do not\nprovide an axiomatization of HWP (Ruse 1975, 241).\n\nProponents of the Semantic View claim that their perspective on\nscientific theory accurately portrays the theoretical structure of\npopulation genetics. Thompson (2007) provides both set-theoretical and\nstate-space renditions of Mendelian genetics. The first involves\ndefining a set-theoretic predicate for the system, viz., \\(\\{P, A, f,\ng\\}\\), where \\(P\\) and \\(A\\) are sets representing, respectively, the\ntotal collection of alleles and loci in the population, while \\(f\\)\nand \\(g\\) are functions assigning an allele to a specific location in,\nrespectively, the diploid cells of an individual or the haploid\ngametic cells. Axioms in this set-theoretic formalization include\n\u201cThe sets \\(P\\) and \\(A\\) are finite and non empty\u201d (2007,\n498). In contrast, the state-space approach of the Semantic View\narticulates a phase space with each dimension representing allelic (or\ngenotypic) frequencies (e.g., cover and Chapter 3 of Lloyd 1994\n[1988]). As an example, \u201cfor population genetic theory, a\ncentral law of succession is the Hardy-Weinberg law\u201d (Thompson\n2007, 499). Mathematically, the diploid version of HWP is written\nthus: \n\n\\[\n(p+q)^2_{\\text{par}} = (p^2 + 2pq + q^2)_{\\text{off}}\n\\]\n\n\nHere \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are the frequencies of two distinct alleles at a\nbiallelic locus. The left-hand side represents the allele frequencies\nin the parental generation and a random mating pattern, while the\nright-hand side captures genotype frequencies in the offspring\ngeneration, as predicted from the parental generation. This is a null\ntheoretical model\u2014actual genotypic and allelic frequencies of\nthe offspring generation often deviate from predicted frequencies\n(e.g., a lethal homozygote recessive would make the\n\\(q^2_{\\text{off}}\\) term = 0). Indeed, HWP holds strictly only in\nabstracted and idealized populations with very specific properties\n(e.g., infinitely large, individuals reproduce randomly) and only when\nthere are no evolutionary forces operating in the population\n(e.g., no selection, mutation, migration, or drift) (e.g., Hartl and\nClark 1989; Winther et al. 2015). HWP is useful also in the way it\ninteracts with laws of succession for selection, mutation, and so\nforth (e.g., Okasha 2012). This powerful population genetic principle\nis central to Semantic View analyses of the mathematical articulation\nof the theoretical structure of population genetics (see also\nLorenzano 2014, Ginnobili 2016).\n\nRecall that the Pragmatic View highlights the internal and external\npluralism\u2014as well as the purposiveness\u2014of model and theory\nstructure. Consider recent uses of population genetic theory to\nspecify the kinds and amounts of population structure existing in\nHomo sapiens. In particular, different measures and\nmathematical modeling methodologies are employed in investigating\nhuman genomic diversity (e.g., Jobling et al. 2004; Barbujani et al.\n2013; Kaplan and Winther 2013). It is possible to\ndistinguish at least two different research projects, each of which\nhas a unique pragmatic content (e.g., aims, values, and methods).\nDiversity partitioning assesses genetic variation within and\namong pre-determined groups using Analysis of Variance (also crucial\nto estimating heritability, Downes 2014). Clustering analysis\nuses Bayesian modeling techniques to simultaneously produce clusters\nand assign individuals to these \u201cunsupervised\u201d cluster\nclassifications. The robust result of the first modeling project is\nthat (approximately) 85% of all genetic variance is found within human\nsubpopulations (e.g., Han Chinese or Sami), 10% across subpopulations\nwithin a continental region, and only 5% is found across continents\n(i.e., \u201cAfrican,\u201d \u201cAsian,\u201d and\n\u201cEuropean\u201d \u2013 Lewontin 1972, 1974). (Recall also that\nwe are all already identical at, on average, 999 out of 1000\nnucleotides.) To calculate diversity partitions at these three nested\nlevels, Lewontin (1972) used a Shannon information-theoretic measure\nclosely related to Sewall Wright\u2019s \\(F\\)-statistic:\n\n\\[\nF_{ST} = \\frac{H_T - \\bar{H}_S}{H_T}\n\\]\n\n\nHere \\(H_T\\) is the total heterozygosity of the population assessed,\nand \\(\\bar{H}_S\\) is the heterozygosity of each subpopulation (group)\nof the relevant population, averaged across all the subpopulations.\n\\(F_{ST}\\) is bounded by 0 and 1, and is a measure of population\nstructure, with higher \\(F_{ST}\\) values suggesting more structure,\nviz., more group differentiation. HWP appears implicitly in both\n\\(H_T\\) and \\(\\bar{H}_S\\), which take heterozygosity (\\(2pq\\)) to be\nequal to the expected proportion of heterozygotes under HWP\nrather than the actual frequency of heterozygotes. \\(H_T\\) is\ncomputed by using the grand population average of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\),\nwhereas calculating \\(\\bar{H}_S\\) involves averaging across the\nexpected heterozygosities of each subpopulation. If random mating\noccurs\u2014and thus HWP applies\u2014across the entire population\nwithout respecting subpopulation borders, then \\(H_T\\) and\n\\(\\bar{H}_S\\) will be equal (i.e., \\(p\\) of the total population and\nof each individual subpopulation will be the same; likewise for\n\\(q\\)). If, instead, HWP applies only within subpopulations but not\nacross the population as a whole, then \\(\\bar{H}_S\\) will be smaller\nthan \\(H_T\\), and \\(F_{ST}\\) will be positive (i.e., there will be\n\u201cexcess homozygosity\u201d across subpopulations, which is\nknown as the \u201cWahlund Principle\u201d in population genetics).\nThis is one way among many to deploy the population-genetic principle\nof HWP. Thus, the Lewontin-style diversity partitioning result that\nonly roughly 5% of the total genetic variance is among races is\nequivalent to saying that \\(F_{ST}\\) across the big three continental\npopulations in Lewontin\u2019s three-level model is 0.05 (e.g.,\nBarbujani et al. 1997). The basic philosophical tendency is to\nassociate the diversity partitioning research project\u2019s\n(approximately) 85%-10%-5% result with an anti-realist\ninterpretation of biological race.\n\nIn contrast, clustering analysis (e.g., Pritchard et al. 2000;\nRosenberg et al. 2002; cf. Edwards 2003) can be readily\nperformed even with the small amount of among-continent genetic\nvariance in Homo sapiens. For instance, when the Bayesian\nmodeling computer program STRUCTURE is asked to produce 5\nclusters, continental \u201craces\u201d appear\u2014African,\nAmerindian, Asian, European, and Pacific Islanders. Interestingly,\nthis modeling technique is also intimately linked to HWP: \u201cOur\nmain modeling assumptions are Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within\npopulations and complete linkage equilibrium between loci within\npopulations\u201d (Pritchard et al. 2000, 946). That is, for a cluster to eventually be robust in the\nmodeling runs, it should meet HWP expectations. Clustering analysis\nhas sometimes been interpreted as a justification for a\nrealist stance towards biological race (see discussions in\nHochman 2013; Winther and Kaplan 2013; Edge and Rosenberg 2015; Spencer 2015).\n\nThis example of the mathematical modeling of human genomic diversity\nteaches that basic and simple formal components can be used in\ndifferent ways to develop and apply theory, both inside and outside of\nscience. In contrast to the Syntactic and Semantic Views, the\nPragmatic View foregrounds tensions vis-\u00e0-vis ontological\nassumptions and political consequences regarding the existence (or\nnot) of biological race between diversity partitioning (Lewontin 1972)\nand clustering analysis (Pritchard et al. 2000) research packages.\nThese ontological ruptures can be identified despite the fact that\nboth research projects assess population structure by examining\ndepartures from HWP (i.e., they measure excess homozygosity), and are\ncompletely consistent (e.g., Winther 2014; Ludwig 2015; Edge and\nRosenberg 2015).\n\nThis exploration of how the three views on the structure of scientific\ntheory address population genetics, and in particular HWP, invites a\ncertain meta-pluralism. That is, the Syntactic View carefully breaks\ndown fundamental concepts and principles in genetics and population\ngenetics, articulating definitions and relations among terms. The\nSemantic View insightfully decomposes and interweaves the complex\nmathematical edifice of population genetics. The Pragmatic View sheds\nlight on modeling choices and on distinct interpretations and\napplications of the same theory or model, both within and without\nscience. The three perspectives are hardly mutually exclusive. (N.B.,\nthe two running examples concern theory structure in Newtonian\nmechanics and population genetics, independently considered. While\ninteresting, debates about \u201cevolutionary forces\u201d are\nbeyond the scope of the current entry; see, e.g., Hitchcock and\nVelasco 2014.)\n6. Conclusion\n\nThe structure of scientific theories is a rich topic. Theorizing and\nmodeling are core activities across the sciences, whether old (e.g.,\nrelativity theory, evolutionary theory) or new (e.g., climate\nmodeling, cognitive science, and systems biology). Furthermore, theory\nremains essential to developing multipurpose tools such as statistical\nmodels and procedures (e.g., Bayesian models for data analysis,\nagent-based models for simulation, network theory for systems\nanalysis). Given the strength and relevance of theory and theorizing\nto the natural sciences, and even to the social sciences (e.g.,\nmicroeconomics, physical, if not cultural, anthropology),\nphilosophical attention to the structure of scientific theories could\nand should increase. This piece has focused on a comparison of three\nmajor perspectives: Syntactic View, Semantic View, and Pragmatic View.\nIn order to handle these complex debates effectively, we have\nsidestepped certain key philosophical questions, including questions\nabout scientific realism; scientific explanation and prediction;\ntheoretical and ontological reductionism; knowledge-production and\nepistemic inference; the distinction between science and technology;\nand the relationship between science and society. Each of these topics\nbears further philosophical investigation in light of the three\nperspectives here explored.\n\nA table helps summarize general aspects of the three views\u2019\nanalyses of the structure of scientific theories:\n\n\n\n\nSyntactic View\nSemantic View\nPragmatic View \n\nTheory Structure\nUninterpreted axiomatic system\n(i) State-space,\n\n(ii) Model-/set-theoretic\nInternal and external pluralism \n\nTheory Interpretation\nCorrespondence rules\n(i) Hierarchy of models,\n\n(ii) Similarity,\n\n(iii) Isomorphism\n(i) Structure already inflected by practice, function, and\napplication\n\n(ii) Pragmatic virtues \n\nIs theory interpretation an aspect of theory structure?\nYes\nNo\nYes, although the distinction is hard to make. \n\n\nTable 2. General aspects of each\nview\u2019s analysis of the structure of scientific theories.\n\n\nThe Syntactic, Semantic, and Pragmatic views are often taken to be\nmutually exclusive and, thus, to be in competition with one another.\nThey indeed make distinct claims about the anatomy of scientific\ntheories. But one can also imagine them to be complementary, focusing\non different aspects and questions of the structure of scientific\ntheories and the process of scientific theorizing. For instance, in\nexploring nonformal and implicit components of theory, the Pragmatic\nView accepts that scientific theories often include mathematical\nparts, but tends to be less interested in these components. Moreover,\nthere is overlap in questions\u2014e.g., Syntactic and Semantic Views\nshare an interest in formalizing theory; the Semantic and Pragmatic\nViews both exhibit concern for scientific practice.\n\nHow are these three views ultimately related? A standard philosophical\nmove is to generalize and abstract, understanding a situation from a\nhigher level. One \u201cmeta\u201d hypothesis is that a given\nphilosophical analysis of theory structure tends to be associated with\na perceived relationship among the three views here discussed. The\nSyntactic View is inclined to interpret the Semantic View\u2019s\nformal machinery as continuous with its own generalizing axiomatic\nstrategy, and hence diagnoses many standard Semantic View critiques\n(Section 3) as missing their mark (the strategy of identity;\ne.g., Friedman 1982; Worrall 1984; Halvorson 2012, 2013, 2019; Lutz\n2012, 2017; cf. Chakravartty 2001). The Semantic View explicitly\ncontrasts its characterization of theory structure with the\n\u201clinguistic\u201d or \u201cmetamathematical\u201d apparatus\nof the Syntactic View (the strategy of combat; e.g., Suppe\n1977; van Fraassen 1980, 1989; Lloyd 1994 [1988]). Finally, the\nPragmatic View, which did not exist as a perspective until relatively\nrecently, imagines theory as pluralistic and can thus ground a\nholistic philosophical investigation. It envisions a meta-pluralism in\nwhich reconstructive axiomatization and mathematical modeling remain\nimportant, though not necessary for all theories. This third view\nendorses a panoply of theoretical structures and theorizing styles,\nnegotiating continuity both between theorizing and \u201cthe\nexperimental life,\u201d and among philosophical analyses of the\nstructure of scientific theories (the strategy of\ncomplementarity; e.g., Hacking 1983, 2009; Galison 1988,\n1997; Craver 2002; Su\u00e1rez and Cartwright 2008; Griesemer 2013). Interestingly, Su\u00e1rez and Pero\n(2019) explicitly concur with the Pragmatic View as described in this\narticle, but believe that \u201cthe semantic conception in its bare\nminimal expression\u201d is compatible with, if not sufficient for,\ncapturing \u201cpragmatic elements and themes involved in a more\nflexible and open-ended approach to scientific theory\u201d\n(Su\u00e1rez and Pero 2019, 348). By design, the ecumenical\nmeta-pluralism sanctioned by the Pragmatic View does not completely\noffset identity and combat strategies. Moreover, only \u201cpartial\nacceptance\u201d of the respective views may ultimately be possible.\nEven so, the complementarity strategy might be worth developing\nfurther. Compared to identity and combat meta-perspectives, it\nprovides broader\u2014or at least different\u2014insights into the\nstructure of scientific theories. More generally, exploring the\nrelations among these views is itself a rich topic for future\nphilosophical work, as is investigating their role in, and\ninterpretation of, active scientific fields ripe for further\nphilosophical analysis such as climate change (e.g., Winsberg 2018),\nmodel organisms (e.g., Ankeny and Leonelli 2020), and cartography and\nGIS (e.g., Winther 2020).\n",
