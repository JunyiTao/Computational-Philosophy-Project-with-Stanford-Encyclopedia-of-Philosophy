    "main_text": "Turing (1950) and Responses to Objections || Lady Lovelace\u2019s Objection\n2.6 Lady Lovelace\u2019s Objection\n\nOne of the most popular objections to the claim that there can be\nthinking machines is suggested by a remark made by Lady Lovelace in\nher memoir on Babbage\u2019s Analytical Engine:\n\nThe Analytical Engine has no pretensions to originate anything. It can\ndo whatever we know how to order it to perform (cited by Hartree,\np. 70)\n\n\nThe key idea is that machines can only do what we know how to\norder them to do (or that machines can never do anything really new,\nor anything that would take us by surprise). As Turing says, one way\nto respond to these challenges is to ask whether we can ever do\nanything \u201creally new.\u201d Suppose, for instance, that the\nworld is deterministic, so that everything that we do is fully\ndetermined by the laws of nature and the boundary conditions of the\nuniverse. There is a sense in which nothing \u201creally new\u201d\nhappens in a deterministic universe\u2014though, of course, the\nuniverse\u2019s being deterministic would be entirely compatible with\nour being surprised by events that occur within it. Moreover\u2014as\nTuring goes on to point out\u2014there are many ways in which even\ndigital computers do things that take us by surprise; more needs to be\nsaid to make clear exactly what the nature of this suggestion is.\n(Yes, we might suppose, digital computers are\n\u201cconstrained\u201d by their programs: they can\u2019t do\nanything that is not permitted by the programs that they have. But\nhuman beings are \u201cconstrained\u201d by their biology and their\ngenetic inheritance in what might be argued to be just the same kind\nof way: they can\u2019t do anything that is not permitted by the\nbiology and genetic inheritance that they have. If a program were\nsufficiently complex\u2014and if the processor(s) on which it ran\nwere sufficiently fast\u2014then it is not easy to say whether the\nkinds of \u201cconstraints\u201d that would remain would necessarily\ndiffer in kind from the kinds of constraints that are imposed by\nbiology and genetic inheritance.)\n\nBringsjord et al. (2001) claim that Turing\u2019s response to the\nLovelace Objection is \u201cmysterious\u201d at best, and\n\u201cincompetent\u201d at worst (p.4). In their view,\nTuring\u2019s claim that \u201ccomputers do take us by\nsurprise\u201d is only true when \u201csurprise\u201d is given a\nvery superficial interpretation. For, while it is true that computers\ndo things that we don\u2019t intend them to do\u2014because\nwe\u2019re not smart enough, or because we\u2019re not careful\nenough, or because there are rare hardware errors, or\nwhatever\u2014it isn\u2019t true that there are any cases in which\nwe should want to say that a computer has originated\nsomething. Whatever merit might be found in this objection, it seems\nworth pointing out that, in the relevant sense of\norigination, human beings \u201coriginate something\u201d\non more or less every occasion in which they engage in conversation:\nthey produce new sentences of natural language that it is appropriate\nfor them to produce in the circumstances in which they find\nthemselves. Thus, on the one hand\u2014for all that Bringsjord et al.\nhave argued\u2014The Turing Test is a perfectly good test for the\npresence of \u201corigination\u201d (or \u201ccreativity,\u201d or\nwhatever). Moreover, on the other hand, for all that Bringsjord et al.\nhave argued, it remains an open question whether a digital computing\ndevice is capable of \u201corigination\u201d in this sense (i.e.\ncapable of producing new sentences that are appropriate to the\ncircumstances in which the computer finds itself). So we are not\noverly inclined to think that Turing\u2019s response to the Lovelace\nObjection is poor; and we are even less inclined to think that Turing\nlacked the resources to provide a satisfactory response on this\npoint.\n",
