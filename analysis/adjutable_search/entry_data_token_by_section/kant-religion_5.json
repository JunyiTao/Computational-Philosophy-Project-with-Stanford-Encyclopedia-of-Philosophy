    "main_text": "Kant\u2019s Philosophy of Religion during the Critical Period || Kant on Deism and Theism\n3.2 Kant on Deism and Theism\n\nKant\u2019s distinction between Deism and Theism is intertwined with\nhis distinction between Transcendental Theology and Natural Theology\n(A631/B659\u2013A632/B660). The meaning of these terms, however, are\nnot what some have assumed (e.g., Wood 1991).\n\nIn his Lectures on the Philosophical Doctrine of Religion,\nKant defines \u201cTranscendental Theology\u201d as the\n\u201crecognition [Kenntniss] of God by means of concepts of\npure reason\u201d (AK 28:596 [1821]). These concepts are not,\nhowever, the pure concepts of the understanding, but rather what he\ncalls the four \u201cclasses of concepts\u201d (B110): namely,\nquantity, quality, relation and modality. More precisely, Kant sees\nTranscendental Theology as a consequence of reason\u2019s quest for\nthe unconditioned condition, with its concepts of God corresponding to\nthe unconditioned for each of the \u201cclasses of concepts\u201d,\nnamely: ens summum (quality), ens entium (quantity),\nens originarium (modality), and ens realissimum\n(relation).\n\nAs Transcendental Theology employs no \u201cinformation\u201d about\nthe conditioned (i.e., the created world), it is without the resources\nneeded to develop a concept of God \u201cin concreto\u201d\n(AK 28:1020 [1817]). Absent the \u201cmaterials for the concept of\nGod from empirical principles and empirical information\u201d (AK\n28:1020 [1817]), Transcendental Theology can do no more than attribute\nto God \u201cwhat is true of him as a thing in general\u201d (AK\n28:1020 [1817]). That is, its concept of God is just that of\nunconditioned quality, quantity, modality, and relation.\n\nAbsent all \u201cinformation\u201d about the conditioned,\nTranscendental Theology is thus without the resources to develop the\nconcept of God used in either Natural or Moral Theology, i.e, the\n\u201cwise author of nature\u201d or the judge and\n\u201cruler\u201d of nature, respectively (AK 28:452 [1968], AK\n28:596 [1821], AK 28:1002 [1817]). Consequently, Kant claims that\nTranscendental Theology is inadequate, yielding \u201conly a\nsilhouette of a theology\u201d (AK 28:605, AK 28:452 [1968]). Its\nconception of God is \u201cuseless\u201d (AK 28:596 [1821]),\n\u201cunusable\u201d (AK 28:452 [1968]), and \u201cquite\nsuperfluous to us\u201d (AK 28:1020 [1817]). For it provides us only\nwith the god of Deism, and according to the lectures, this God is\n\u201cuseless\u201d and \u201cunusable\u201d.\n\nHence, despite the familiar-seeming term, Kant does not mean by\n\u201cDeism\u201d how it was typically used by the British. Their\nDeism is rather much more akin to what Kant means by\n\u201cTheism\u201d, as the outcome of Natural (vs. Transcendental)\nTheology. That is, Kant maintains in the Critique of Pure\nReason that our picture of nature as having systematic unity\ncommits us to seeing nature \u201cas if\u201d it were created by a\n\u201cWise Author\u201d (A644/B672\u2013A645/B673).\n\nThis is not, however, a new twist on the Argument from Design. While\nKant turns to Theism to explain how we make the ground of the natural\norder \u201ccomprehensible\u201d (AK 6:65n [1793]) to ourselves,\nthis is not a proof for God\u2019s existence but rather an appeal to\nthe idea of a Wise Author varyingly described as\n\u201csymbolic\u201d (AK 4:437 [1785b]), \u201cheuristic\u201d\n(A671/B699), a \u201cfocus imaginarius\u201d (A645/B673),\nor a supposition to be taken\n\n\nonly problematically [vs assertorically] \u2026 so as to regard all\nthe connection of things in the world of sense as if they had their\nground in this being of reason. (A681/B709)\n\n\nIt is nonetheless a supposition that (at least from the later 1770\nthrough most of the 1780s) Kant believes we cannot do without.\n\u201c[W]e must presuppose such a being\u201d (A697/B725), for in\nits absence, reason would be at odds with itself, at once intending a\nsystematic unity to nature and at the same time without a principle to\nground that systematicity.\n\nLastly, note that despite Allen Wood\u2019s claim in\n\u201cKant\u2019s Deism\u201d that Kant\u2019s account of Deism is\ndisconnected from the \u201ccommon seventeenth- and\neighteenth-century usage\u201d and thus is\n\u201cidiosyncratic\u201d (Wood 1991), Wood has mistaken the more\nfamiliar British use of the term with how the term was used by German\nRationalism. For example, Wolff, in his Theologia Naturalis\nhighlights the areas of agreement between Deism and atheism, arguing\nthat Deism can easily devolve into a \u201cpractical atheism\u201d.\n(Theologia Naturalis, \u00a7547). Baumgarten as well, in the\nMetaphysica, the textbook that Kant used in his courses on\nMetaphysics and Natural Theology, follows Wolff in this, describing\nDeism as \u201cthe doctrine [which] maintains that almost nothing is\nconceivable about God, except perhaps his existence\u201d\n(\u00a7862). Hence, however idiosyncratic this use of\n\u201cDeism\u201d may seem to the modern reader, it would not have\nbeen so for Kant\u2019s contemporary audience. In short, Kant uses\n\u201cDeism\u201d in a manner reflective of Wolff and\nBaumgarten\u2019s approach rather than how the British employed\nit.\n",
