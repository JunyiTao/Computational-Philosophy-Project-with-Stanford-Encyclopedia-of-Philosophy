Propositions and Propositional Functions\n\nIn Principia Mathematica Russell\u2019s multiple\nrelation theory of judgment is introduced by presenting an\nontological vision:\n\n\nThe universe consists of objects having various qualities and standing\nin various relations. (Whitehead and Russell 1910\u201313, 43)\n\n\nRussell goes on to explain the multiple relation theory of judgment,\nwhich finds the place of propositions in this world of objects and\nqualities standing in relations. (See the entry on\n propositions.)\n \n\nRussell\u2019s multiple relation theory, that he held from 1910 to\naround 1919, argued that the constituents of propositions, say\n\u2018Desdemona loves Cassio\u2019, are unified in a way that does\nnot make it the case that they constitute a fact by themselves. Those\nconstituents occur only in the context of beliefs, say, \u2018Othello\njudges that Desdemona loves Cassio\u2019. The real fact consists of a\nrelation of Belief holding between the constituents Othello,\nDesdemona, and Cassio; \\(B(o,d,L,c)\\). Because one might also have\nbelieved propositions of other structures, such as \\(B(o,F,a)\\) there\nneed to be many such relations \\(B\\), of different\n\u201carities\u201d, or number of arguments, hence the name\n\u201cmultiple relation\u201d theory. Like the construction of\nnumbers, this construction abstracts from what a number of occurrences\nof a belief have in common, namely, a relation between a believer and\nvarious objects in a certain order. The account also makes the\nproposition an incomplete symbol because there is no constituent in\nthe analysis of \u2018\\(x\\) believes that \\(p\\)\u2019 that\ncorresponds to \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019. As a result Russell concludes\nthat:\n\n\nIt will be seen that, according to the above account, a judgment does\nnot have a single object, namely a proposition, but has several\ninterrelated objects. That is to say, the relation which constitutes\njudgment is not a relation of two terms, namely the judging mind and\nthe proposition, but is a relation of several terms, namely the mind\nand what we call the constituents of the proposition\u2026\n\nOwing to the plurality of the objects of a single judgment, it follows\nthat what we call a \u201cproposition\u201d (in which it is to be\ndistinguished from the phrase expressing it) is not a single entity at\nall. That is to say, the phrase which expresses a proposition is what\nwe call an \u201cincomplete\u201d symbol; it does not have meaning\nin itself, but requires some supplementation in order to acquire a\ncomplete meaning. (Whitehead and Russell 1910\u201313,\n43\u201344)\n\n\nAlthough bound variables ranging over propositions hardly occur in\nPrincipia Mathematica (with a prominent exception in\n\u221714.3), it would seem that the whole theory of types is a\ntheory of propositional functions. Yet following on the claim that\npropositions are \u201cnot single entities at all\u201d, Russell\nsays the same for propositional functions. In the Introduction to\nMathematical Philosophy, Russell says that propositional\nfunctions are really \u201cnothing\u201d, but \u201cnonetheless\nimportant for that\u201d (Russell 1919, 96). This comment makes best\nsense if we think of propositional functions as somehow constructed by\nabstracting them from their values, which are propositions. The\npropositional function \u201c\\(x\\) is human\u201d is abstracted from\nits values \u201cSocrates is human\u201d, \u201cPlato is\nhuman\u201d, etc. Viewing propositional functions as constructions\nfrom propositions, that are in turn constructions by the multiple\nrelation theory, helps to make sense of certain features of the theory\nof types of propositional functions in Principia Mathematica.\nWe can understand how propositional functions seem to depend on their\nvalues, namely propositions, and how propositions in turn can\nthemselves be logical constructions. The relation of this dependence\nto the theory of types is explained in the Introduction to\nPrincipia Mathematica in terms of the notion of\n\u201cpresupposing\u201d:\n\n\nIt would seem, however, that the essential characteristic of a\nfunction is ambiguity\u2026 We may express this by saying\nthat \u201c\\(\\phi x\\)\u201d ambiguously denotes \\(\\phi a, \\phi b,\n\\phi c,\\) etc., where \\(\\phi a, \\phi b, \\phi c,\\) etc. are the various\nvalues of \u201c\\(\\phi x\\).\u201d \u2026 It will be seen that,\naccording to the above account, the values of a function are\npresupposed by that function, not vice versa. It is sufficiently\nobvious, in any particular case, that a value of a function does not\npresuppose the function. Thus for example the proposition\n\u201cSocrates is human\u201d can be perfectly apprehended without\nregarding it as a value of the function \u201c\\(x\\) is human.\u201d\nIt is true that, conversely, a function can be apprehended without its\nbeing necessary to apprehend its values severally and individually. If\nthis were not the case, no function could be apprehended at all, since\nthe number of values (true and false) of a function is necessarily\nindefinite and there are necessarily possible arguments with which we\nare not acquainted. (Russell 1910\u201313, 39\u201340)\n\n\nThe notion of \u201cincomplete symbol\u201d seems less appropriate\nthan \u201cconstruction\u201d in the case of propositional functions\nand propositions. To classify propositions and even propositional\nfunctions as instances of the same logical phenomenon as definite\ndescriptions requires a considerable broadening of the notion.\n\nThe ontological status of propositions and propositional functions\nwithin Russell\u2019s logic, and in particular, in Principia\nMathematica, is currently the subject of considerable debate. One\ninterpretation, which we might call \u201crealist,\u201d is\nsummarized in this footnote by Alonzo Church in his 1976 study of the\nramified theory of types:\n\n\nThus we take propositions as values of the propositional variables, on\nthe ground that this is what is clearly demanded by the background and\npurpose of Russell\u2019s logic, and in spite of what seems to be an\nexplicit denial by Whitehead and Russell in PM, pp. 43\u201344.\n\nIn fact, Whitehead and Russell make the claim: \u201cthat what we\ncall a \u2018proposition\u2019 (in the sense in which this is\ndistinguished from the phrase expressing it) is not a single entity at\nall. That is to say, the phrase which expresses a proposition is what\nwe call an \u2018incomplete symbol\u2019 \u2026\u201d They seem\nto be aware that this fragmenting of propositions requires a similar\nfragmenting of propositional functions. But the contextual definition\nor definitions that are implicitly promised by the \u201cincomplete\nsymbol\u201d characterization are never fully supplied, and it is in\nparticular how they would explain away the use of bound propositional\nand functional variables. If some things that are said by Russell in\nIV and V of his Introduction to the second edition may be taken as an\nindication of what is intended, it is probable that the contextual\ndefinitions would not stand scrutiny.\n\nMany passages in [(Russell 1908)] and [(Whitehead and Russell\n1910\u201313)] may be understood as saying or as having the\nconsequence that the values of propositional functions are sentences.\nBut a coherent semantics of Russell\u2019s formalized language can\nhardly be provided on this basis (notice in particular, that, since\nsentences are also substituted for propositional variables, it would\nbe necessary to take sentences as names of sentences.) And since the\npassages in question seem to involve confusions of use and mention or\nkindred confusions that may be merely careless, it is not certain that\nthey are to be regarded as precise statements of a semantics. (Church\n1976, n.4)\n\n\nGregory Landini (1998) has proposed that there is indeed a coherent\nsemantics for propositions and propositional functions in PM, which\ntreats functions and propositions as linguistic entities. Landini\nproposes that this \u201cnominalist semantics\u201d is the intended\ninterpretation of PM and is what remains of Russell\u2019s earlier\n\u201csubstitutional theory.\u201d He argues that Russell was led to\nthis nominalism after first rejecting the reality of classes, then of\npropositional functions, and finally the reality of propositions. This\nrejection, according to Landini, leaves us with only a nominalist\nmetaphysics of individuals and expressions as the interpretation of\nRussell\u2019s logic. See also Cocchiarella (1980), who describes a\n\u201cnominalist semantics\u201d for ramified type theory, but\nrejects it as Russell\u2019s intended interpretation. Sainsbury\n(1979) describes a \u201csubstitutional\u201d interpretation of the\nquantifiers over propositional functions, but combines this with a\ntruth-conditional semantics that does not require the ramification of\nthe theory of types that is central to Russell\u2019s interpretation\nin PM.\n\nPropositions and propositional functions are unlike definite\ndescriptions and classes in that there are no explicit definitions of\nthem in PM. It is unclear what it means to say: a symbol for a\nproposition \u2014 such as a variable \\(p\\) or \\(q\\) \u2014 has\n\u201cno meaning in isolation\u201d, but the meaning can be given\n\u201cin context\u201d. No such contextual definition seems possible\nin a logic in which propositions and propositional functions appear as\nprimitive notions.\n",
