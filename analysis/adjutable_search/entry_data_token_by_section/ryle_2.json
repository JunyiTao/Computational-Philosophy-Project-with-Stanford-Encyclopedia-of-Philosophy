Concepts, Propositions, and Meaning\n\nThe implications of this view for the concept of meaning or for\nnominalisations of the verb \u2018to mean\u2019 are important. We\nare not at all likely to be misled by expressions of the form\n\u2018x means what y means.\u2019 But when we use\nthe expression quasi-descriptively, as in \u2018The meaning of\nx is the same as the meaning of y\u2019 or\n\u2018The meaning of x is doubtful\u2019 we are liable to\nbe misled into thinking that we are referring to some queer new\nobject. Ryle generalises the point to suggest that all the mistaken\ndoctrines of concepts, ideas, terms, judgment, contents, and the like\nderive from the fallacy\n\nthat there must be something referred to by such expressions\nas \u2018the meaning of the word (phrase or sentence)\nx\u2019 [which is analogous to the policeman] who is\nreferred to by the descriptive phrase \u2018Our village policeman is\nfond of football\u2019. (1932, 56)\n\n\nThe meaning of an expression is not an entity denoted by it and not\nthe nominee of any thing. It would be a related mistake to\nsuppose, Ryle tells us, that a particular concept is precisely\nindicated by a particular expression: as if the idea of equality could\nbe identified as that for which the word \u2018equality\u2019 stands\n(1945, 206). For Ryle, agreeing here with Wittgenstein,\n\u201cconcepts are not things that are there crystallised in a\nsplendid isolation\u201d; rather\n\nthey are discriminable features, but not detachable atoms, of what is\nintegrally said or integrally thought. They are not detachable parts\nof, but distinguishable contributions to, the unitary senses of\ncomplete sentences. To examine them is to examine the live force of\nthings that we actually say. It is to examine them not in retirement,\nbut doing their co-operative work. (1962b, 185)\n [3]\n\n\nThe idea that expressions have meaning insofar as they stand for\nthings should be rejected. Indeed, some expressions denote (in one of\na variety of ways) because they are significant. To learn the meaning\nof an expression is to learn to operate correctly with it; more like\nlearning a piece of drill than like coming across a previously\nunencountered object (1957, 365).\n\nConcepts are instead to be understood as that which is conveyed by a\nword or phrase independently of the language (English or French) in\nwhich the word is written or spoken. Although we tend to make use of\nabstract nouns to talk about that which is conveyed by various words,\nthis should not mislead us. Russell and Moore may have described their\npursuits as the investigation of supra-mundane entities, but this was\nnot, claims Ryle, the way they or any other philosopher set about\ntheir task. Aristotle, for example, when studying Plato\u2019s\naccount of Pleasure, did not \u201cstare hard\u201d at an entity or\nEssence designated by this abstract noun: \u201cInstead he rightly\nconsidered what we are asserting or denying in concreto when\nwe say that someone did or did not enjoy the concert; or that someone\nenjoys this piece of music more than that piece\u201d (1962b, 185).\nUnlike the abstract noun \u201cPleasure\u201d, the live verb is\nmaking specific contributions to sense. Similarly, an analysis of the\nconcept, say, of existence \u201ccannot consist just in acts\nof contemplating a rarefied object, withdrawn, like a coin in a\nmuseum, from its native commercial transactions\u201d (1962b,\n185).\n",
