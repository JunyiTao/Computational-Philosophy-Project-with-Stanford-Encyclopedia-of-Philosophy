    "main_text": "Scientific Reasoning || The Paradox of Confirmation\n3.1 The Paradox of Confirmation\n\nHempel\u2019s most controversial argument appeared in an article\nabout induction entitled \u201cStudies in the Logic of\nConfirmation\u201d (1945a), where he evaluates the conditions under\nwhich an empirical generalization would be confirmed or disconfirmed\nby instances or non-instances of its antecedent and consequent. He\nfocused on universally quantified material conditionals, exemplified\nby sentences of the form, \u201c\\((x)(Rx \\supset Bx)\\)\u201d. With\n\u201c\\(Rx\\)\u201d interpreted as \u201c\\(x\\) is a\nraven\u201d and \u201c\\(Bx\\)\u201d as \u201c\\(x\\)\nis black\u201d, this schema represents, in first-order symbolic\nlogic, the claim, \u201cAll ravens are black\u201d. He also\nconsidered sentences of more complex logical structures, but nothing\nhinges upon their use that cannot be addressed relative to an example\nof the simplest possible kind. And, indeed, Hempel took sentences of\nthis kind as exemplars of \u201clawlike sentences\u201d, which\ncombine purely universal form with what he called purely\nqualitative predicates. So lawlike sentences that are true as\nextensional generalizations are \u201claws\u201d (Hempel &\nOppenheim 1948).\n\nHempel applied \u201cNicod\u2019s criterion\u201d to this example,\nwhere Nicod had proposed that, in relation to conditional hypotheses,\ninstances of their antecedents that are also instances of their\nconsequents confirm them; instances of their antecedents that are not\ninstances of their consequents disconfirm them; and non-instantiations\nof their antecedents are neutral, neither confirming nor\ndisconfirming. Applied to the raven hypothesis, this means that, given\na thing named \u201c\\(c\\)\u201d, the truth of\n\u201c\\(Rc\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(Bc\\)\u201d confirms it; the truth\nof \u201c\\(Rc\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(\\neg Bc\\)\u201d disconfirms it;\nand the truth of \u201c\\(\\neg Rc\\)\u201d neither confirms nor\ndisconfirms it, but remains evidentially neutral, regardless of the\ntruth value of \u201c\\(Bc\\)\u201d. To these highly intuitive\nconditions, Hempel added that, since logically equivalent hypotheses\nhave the same empirical content, whatever confirms one member of a set\nof logically equivalent hypotheses must also confirm the others, which\nhe called \u201cthe equivalence condition\u201d.\n\nNo matter how intuitive, Hempel proceeded to demonstrate that this\ncreates a paradox. By Nicod\u2019s criterion, \u201c\\((x)(Rx \\supset\nBx)\\)\u201d is confirmed by ravens that are black. But, by that same\nstandard, \u201c\\((x)(\\neg Bx \\supset \\neg Rx)\\)\u201d is confirmed\nby non-black non-ravens, such as white shoes! Since these are\nlogically equivalent and have the same empirical content, they must be\nconfirmed or disconfirmed by all and only the same instances. This\nmeans that\u2014no matter how counter-intuitive\u2014the lawlike\nhypothesis, \u201cAll ravens are black\u201d, is confirmed by\nobservations of white shoes! Since these hypotheses are also\nequivalent to \u201c\\((x)(\\neg Rx \\vee Bx)\\)\u201d, which asserts\nthat everything either is not a raven or is black, it is also the case\nthat observations of non-ravens confirms the hypothesis, regardless of\ntheir color. Observations of non-ravens, however, unlike those of\nblack ravens, confirm alternative hypotheses, like \u201cAll ravens\nare blue\u201d and \u201cAll ravens are green\u201d. Hempel\u2019s\npoint was that the application of Nicod\u2019s criterion means that,\nsince even observations of non-ravens are confirmatory, the class of\nneutral instances in fact has no members.\n",
