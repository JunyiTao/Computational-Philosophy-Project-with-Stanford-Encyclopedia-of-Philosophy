    "main_text": "Knowledge as Justified True Belief || The Truth Condition\n1.1 The Truth Condition\n\nMost epistemologists have found it overwhelmingly plausible that what\nis false cannot be known. For example, Hillary Clinton did not win the\n2016 US Presidential election. Consequently, nobody knows that Hillary\nClinton won the election. One can only know things that are true.\n\nSometimes when people are very confident of something that turns out\nto be wrong, we use the word \u201cknows\u201d to describe their\nsituation. Many people expected Clinton to win the election. Speaking\nloosely, one might even say that many people \u201cknew\u201d that\nClinton would win the election\u2014until she lost. Hazlett (2010)\nargues on the basis of data like this that \u201cknows\u201d is not\na factive\n verb.[2]\n Hazlett\u2019s diagnosis is deeply controversial; most\nepistemologists will treat sentences like \u201cI knew that Clinton\nwas going to win\u201d as a kind of exaggeration\u2014as not\nliterally true.\n\nSomething\u2019s truth does not require that anyone can know or prove\nthat it is true. Not all truths are established truths. If\nyou flip a coin and never check how it landed, it may be true that it\nlanded heads, even if nobody has any way to tell. Truth is a\nmetaphysical, as opposed to epistemological, notion:\ntruth is a matter of how things are, not how they can be\nshown to be. So when we say that only true things can be\nknown, we\u2019re not (yet) saying anything about how anyone can\naccess the truth. As we\u2019ll see, the other conditions\nhave important roles to play here. Knowledge is a kind of relationship\nwith the truth\u2014to know something is to have a certain kind of\naccess to a\n fact.[3]\n",
