    "main_text": "The Moral Debate || Nation-state in global context\n3.5 Nation-state in global context\n\nThe migration crisis has made the nation-state in global context the\ncentral political topic concerning nationality. Before moving on to\ncurrent events, the state of art before the crisis should be\nsummarized. First, consider the debates on territory and nation and\nissues of global justice.\n\nLiberal nationalists try to preserve the traditional nationalist link\nbetween ethnic \u201cownership\u201d of the state and sovereignty\nand territorial control, but in a much more flexible and sophisticated\nsetting. Tamar Meisels thus argues in favor of \u201ctaking existing\nnational settlements into account as a central factor in demarcating\nterritorial boundaries\u201d since this line \u201chas both liberal\nfoundations\u201d (i.e., in the work of John Locke) and\nliberal-national appeal (2009: 159) grounded in its affinity with the\nliberal doctrine of national self-determination. She combines it with\nChaim Gans\u2019 (2003: Ch. 4) interpretation of \u201chistorical\nright\u201d claims as \u201cthe right to formative\nterritories\u201d. She thus combines \u201chistorical arguments,\nunderstood as claims to formative territories\u201d, with her\nargument from settlement and insists on their interplay and mutual\nreinforcement, presenting them as being \u201cmost closely related\nto, and based on, liberal nationalist assumptions and underlying\nideas\u201d (Meisels 2009: 160). She nevertheless stresses that more\nthan one ethnic group can have formative ties to a given territory,\nand that there might be competing claims based on\n settlement.[29]\n But, given the ethno-national conflicts of the twentieth century, one\ncan safely assume that culturally plural states divided into isolated\nand closed sub-communities glued together merely by arrangements of\nmodus vivendi are inherently unstable. Stability might\ntherefore require that the pluralist society envisioned by liberal\nculturalists promote quite intense intra-state interaction between\ncultural groups in order to forestall mistrust, reduce prejudice, and\ncreate a solid basis for cohabitation.\n\nBut where should one stop? The question arises since there are many\ngeographically open, interacting territories of various sizes.\nConsider first the geographical openness of big continental planes,\nthen add the modern ease of interaction (\u201cNo island is an island\nany more\u201d, one could say), and, finally and dramatically, the\nsubstantial ecological interconnectedness of land and climate. Here,\nthe tough nationalistic line is no longer proposed seriously in\nethical debates, so the furthest pro-national extreme is in fact a\nrelatively moderate stance, exemplified by Miller in the works listed.\nHere is a typical proposal of his concerning global justice based on\nnation-states: it might become a matter of national pride to have set\naside a certain percentage of GDP for developmental\ngoals\u2014perhaps for projects in one particular country or group of\ncountries (2013: 182).\n\nThis brings us to the topic of migrations, and the heated debate on\nthe present\n scene.[30]\n In Europe immigration is probably the main topic of the present day\npopulist uproar, and in the United States it is one of the main\ntopics. So, immigration plus the nationalist-populist reactions to it\nare in the current decade the main testing ground for nationalist and\ncosmopolitan views.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the pro-national side in the debate. Liberal\nnationalists, in particular Miller, have put forward some thoughtful\npro-nationalist proposal concerning immigration. Miller\u2019s\nproposal allows refugees to seek asylum temporarily until the\nsituation in their country of origin improves; it also limits economic\nmigration. Miller argues against the defensibility of a global\nstandard for equality, opportunity, welfare, etc., because measures of\njust equality are context-bound. People do have the right to a minimum\nstandard of living, but the right to migrate only activates as a last\nresort after all other measures within a candidate-migrant\u2019s\ncountry of origin have been tried. However, he also (particularly in\nhis book on \u201cStrangers in our midst\u201d, 2016), claims that\nnational responsibility to accept immigrant refugees is balanced by\nconsiderations of the interest of would-be immigrants and the\ninterests that national communities have in maintaining control over\ntheir own composition and character.\n\nIf we agree with the liberal nationalists on the positive side, we can\nask about the dynamics of the help required for the immigrants.\nDistinguish at least three stages, first, the immediate emergency\n(starvation, freezing, urgent medical problems) and catering to it,\nsecond, settlement and learning (on the host and the immigrant\nnewcomer side), and third, the stage of (some kind of) citizenship, of\nrelatively stable life in the host country.\n\nIn the first phase, the immediate help comes first, both normatively\nand causally: just accept the would-be refugees (indeed, the would-be\nrefugees should be helped in leaving their countries and travelling to\nthe host country). In longer term, staying should involve opportunity\nfor work and training.\n\nBut there is more. The Samaritan obligation can and should function as\na preparation for wider global\n activity.[31]\n So, we have two theoretical steps, first, accepting Samaritanism and\nsecond, agreeing with deeper trans-national measure of blocking\ndistant causes, like poverty and wars in the Third world. Let us call\nthis \u201cSamaritan-to-deeper-measures model\u201d. The model is\ngeared to the dramatically changed playground in which the nationalism\nissues are played out in the context of populism and refugee crisis,\nraising issues that were not around two decades ago.\n",
