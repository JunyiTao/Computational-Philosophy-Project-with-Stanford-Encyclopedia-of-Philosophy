    "main_text": "The Philosophical History of Hope || Ancient Accounts of Hope\n2.1 Ancient Accounts of Hope\n\nAlthough there are few explicit and systematic treatments of hope\n(elpis) in ancient Greek philosophies, they nevertheless\ncontain important approaches to the nature of hope and its role in the\ngood life and practical deliberation (Gravlee 2020). Ambivalent\nevaluations of hope can be found in many texts. On the one hand, hope\nis often seen as an attitude of those who have insufficient knowledge\nor are easily swayed by wishful thinking. It thus has a negative\nreputation (Vogt 2017) as an attitude that (at least potentially)\nmisleads actions and agents. Even Solon focuses on empty hopes (see\nLewis 2006: 85; Caston and Kaster 2016). On the other hand, hope is\npraised as a response to despair, e.g., in the dialogues of\nThucydides, who advances a nuanced view of the potential dangers and\nadvantages of hope (Schlosser 2013). An ambivalent evaluation of hope\nis also reflected in Hesiod\u2019s version of the tale of Pandora.\nWhen all the evils had escaped from Pandora\u2019s jar, famously,\nonly hope (elpis) remained (\u201cWorks and Days\u201d,\n\u00a790). This seems to suggest that hope can also sustain human agency\nin the face of widespread evil. It must be noted, however, that there\nare many competing interpretations of why elpis remained in\nthe jar (Verdenius 1985): Was it to keep hope available for humans or,\nrather, to keep hope from humankind? Is hope consequently to be regarded as\ngood (\u201ca comfort to man in his misery and a stimulus rousing his\nactivity\u201d, Verdenius 1985: 66) or as evil (\u201cidle hope in\nwhich the lazy man indulges when he should be working honestly for his\nliving\u201d, Verdenius 1985: 66)? These different interpretations of\nPandora\u2019s myth are taken up throughout the history of Philosophy\n(especially among existentialist authors, see\n section 2.5).\n\nIn Plato\u2019s dialogues, we find negative as well as positive\nassessments of hope. In particular, Plato even argues that hope can be\nrational. In the Timaeus, Plato adopts a rather negative\nattitude towards hope by recounting a myth according to which the\ndivine beings give us \u201cthose mindless advisers confidence and\nfear, (\u2026) and gullible hope\u201d (Timaeus, 69b). In the\nPhilebus, by contrast, he seems to also allow for a more\nfavorable view of the role of hope in human life. The relevant\ndiscussion of hope takes place in the context of an argument about\n\u201cfalse pleasures\u201d. Against Protarch\u2019s objection that\nonly opinions can be true or false, but not pleasures, Socrates\ndevelops an analogy between opinion and pleasure (Philebus,\n36d). In this context, he describes \u201cpleasures of\nanticipation\u201d, that is, expectations of future pleasures, that\nare called hopes (Philebus, 39e3). As Frede (1985) argues, in\nthe case of such pleasures of anticipation what we enjoy at present is\nonly a thought. As there can be a discrepancy between the thought that\nwe enjoy and what is in fact going to happen, the pleasure can be\ntrue\u2014in which case it seems appropriate to say that the\ncorresponding hope can be rationally endorsed\u2014or false (Frede\n1985: 174f.). The Philebus also presents hope as essential to\nhuman agency: Plato seems to suggest that all our agential\nrepresentations are concerned with the future, which connects them to\nhope (Vogt 2017). Plato\u2019s positive view of hope can also be\nfound in the Apology and the Phaedo, where he argues\nthat hope for the afterlife is rational (Gravlee 2020).\n\nAristotle\u2019s treatment of hope in the context of his discussion\nof the virtue of courage has received some attention (Gravlee 2000;\nLear 2006), as well as the role of hope in his practical philosophy in\ngeneral (Kontos 2021a). On the one hand, Aristotle describes the\nrelationship between hope and courage as a contrast. He identifies two\nsources of hopefulness that are non-courageous: First, it is possible\nto be hopeful \u201cat sea [\u2026] and in disease\u201d, but this hope\ndoes not involve courage, insofar as, in such situations, there is\nneither \u201copportunity of showing prowess\u201d, nor is death\n\u201cnoble\u201d in these cases, according to Aristotle\n(Nicomachean Ethics 3.6, 1115a35ff.). Second, one can be\nhopeful based on one\u2019s experience of good fortune\n(Nicomachean Ethics 3.8, 1117a10ff.). In this case, the\nbelief in the probability of a good outcome is not well grounded, but\nfounded on mere induction. Both kinds of hopefulness are\nnon-courageous. On the other hand, there is also a connection between\nhope and courage via the concept of confidence (Gravlee 2000). For\nexample, Aristotle says:\n\n\nThe coward, then, is a despairing sort of person; for he fears\neverything. The brave man, on the other hand, has the opposite\ndisposition; for confidence is the mark of a hopeful disposition.\n(Nicomachean Ethics 3.7, 1116a2)\n\n\nThus, even though not every hopeful person is courageous, every\ncourageous person is hopeful. Hopefulness creates confidence, which,\nif derived from the right sources, can lead to the virtue of courage.\nGravlee (2000: 471ff.) identifies two further considerations that are\nrelevant for hope\u2019s value in Aristotle\u2019s thought. First,\nhope underlies deliberation, which is needed for any exercise of a\nvirtuous disposition. Second, hopefulness is also presented as\nvaluable in its connection with youth and the virtue of\nmegalopsychia (high-mindedness): Hopefulness spurs us to the\npursuit of the noble. Kontos (2021a, 2021b) focuses both on the\nphenomenology of hope in Aristotle\u2019s thought, and the normative\nquestion of what the conditions are for \u201choping-well\u201d: He\nargues that hoping-well constitutes a correct engagement with moral\nluck, and it requires drawing on past experiences in a proper way as\nwell as reliably perceiving the present reality.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, hope received a less favorable treatment by\nthe Stoic philosophers. In particular, Seneca emphasizes hope\u2019s\nrelation to fear (an idea that is later taken up by Spinoza, see\n section 2.3):\n\n\n[t]hey are bound up with one another, unconnected as they may seem.\nWidely different though they are, the two of them march in unison like\na prisoner and the escort he is handcuffed to. Fear keeps pace with\nhope. Nor does their so moving together surprise me; both belong to a\nmind in suspense, to a mind in a state of anxiety through looking into\nthe future. Both are mainly due to projecting our thoughts far ahead\nof us instead of adapting ourselves to the present. (Seneca, Letter\n5.7\u20138; in: 1969: 38)\n\n\nAccording to Seneca, we should avoid both fear and hope and instead\nfocus on the present and cultivate tranquility of the soul.\n",
