    "main_text": "Work || Historiography of Logic\n3.3 Historiography of Logic\n\nScholz\u2019s most important contributions to the development of\nlogic can be seen in his contributions to the historiography of logic.\nHe stressed the value of the contributions of Gottfried Wilhelm\nLeibniz (1646\u20131716) and Bernard Bolzano (1781\u20131848) for\nthe emergence of modern logic. He applied the method of logical\nanalysis to classical philosophical texts, reconsidering, e. g.,\nAnselm\u2019s proof of the existence of God (Scholz 1950/51),\nDescartes\u2019s cogito argument (Scholz 1931b), and\nKant\u2019s transcendental deduction (Scholz 1943/44). He devoted\nconsiderable efforts to the study of Gottlob Frege\u2019s work (cf.\nSundholm 2005) and promoted David Hilbert\u2019s metamathematics\n(Scholz 1942). With his Geschichte der Logik (1931a) Heinrich\nScholz was a pioneer in the historiography of modern logic. Scholz\nrestricted his presentation to formal logic or logistics. He\nreconstructs its development starting with Aristotle\u2019s logic,\ndiscussing the Stoic modifications, medieval and early modern\nvariations, arriving at Franz Brentano\u2019s (1838\u20131917)\ncontributions, whom he called the \u201conly original figure among\nthe German formal logicians [in philosophy] of the 19th\ncentury after Bolzano and prior to Husserl\u201d\n(pp. 46\u201347). For Scholz, the modern shape of logic starts with\nLeibniz: \u201cWe speak of a sunrise mentioning the great name of\nLeibniz. With him a new life of Aristotelian logic begins,\nwhich finds its most beautiful manifestation in our days in the modern\nexact logic in the form of logistics\u201d (p. 48). He highlighted\nGottlob Frege as \u201cthe greatest genius of the new logic in the\n19th century\u201d (p. 57). According to Scholz he did\nmore than any other logician for the interpretation of fundamental\nmathematical concepts with the help of fundamental concepts of logic\noperating on the basis of exactly defined principles. With this he\nraised the logical calculus to a level which made the Leibnizian\n\u201cgame with signs\u201d possible.\n",
