    "main_text": "Epistemological and Metaphysical Issues || Is Consciousness Binary?\n4.7 Is Consciousness Binary?\n One metaphysical question that is more directly relevant for the\nquestion of the phylogenetic distribution and evolution of\nconsciousness is whether possessing it (i.e. being conscious) is\nbinary (i.e. on/off, all-or-nothing), or admits of degrees.  Several\nauthors have, for quite different reasons, denied what they take to be\na common but problematic assumption \u2014 that \u201cConsciousness is an\non/off switch; a system is either conscious or not,\u201d as Searle \u2014\nwho endorses the thesis puts it (quoted by Lycan 1996, who denies the\nthesis).\n\n\nLycan argues that consciousness can come in a wide spectrum of degrees\nof richness or fullness of consciousness, and that there is a\nmeaningful sense in which a system with a minimal degree of\nconsciousness is not \u201creally\u201d conscious (1996, p. 8). Admittedly, this\nsounds a bit paradoxical, but the point seems to be that it is\ncounter-intuitive for us to consider very low degrees of\nconsciousness, as it is hard to imagine the contents of very simple\nmental states. One reading of this is that Lycan is arguing that the\npredicate \u2018conscious\u2019 is vague, without committing himself\nto the view that consciousness is distributed according to a linear\nscale.\n\nDennett (1995) also argues that consciousness is not binary. He does\nso in the context of advocating a radically deflationary anti-realism\nabout consciousness overall, on which consciousness is essentially an\nillusion created by language (1991/1995). On his view, \u201cthe very idea\nof there being a dividing line between those creatures \u2018it is\nlike something to be\u2019 and those that are \u2018mere\nautomata\u2019 (is) an artifact of our traditional assumptions.\u201d\n(1995, p. 706)\n\n Velmans (2012) distinguishes between \u2018discontinuity\ntheories\u2019, which claim that there was a particular point at\nwhich consciousness originated, before which there was no\nconsciousness (this applies both the universe at large, and also\nto any particular consciousness individual), and \u2018continuity\ntheories\u2019, which conceptualize the evolution of consciousness in\nterms of \u201ca gradual transition in consciousness from unrecognizable to\nrecognizable.\u201d He argues that continuity theories are more elegant, as\nany discontinuity is based on arbitrary criteria, and that\ndiscontinuity theories face \u201cthe hard problem\u201d in a way that\ncontinuity theories don\u2019t. Velmans takes these arguments to weigh in\nfavor of adopting, not just a continuity theory, but a form of\npanpsychism.\n\nThe three authors described just above deny that consciousness is\nbinary for very different reasons, and each of their views is\ncontroversial. Further, none of them offers much in the way of tools\nor concepts for thinking about the putatively nonbinary nature of\nconsciousness. Following up on Lycan\u2019s suggestion of degrees of\nrichness or fullness, one might ask what graded dimensions or\nqualitative thresholds might be available to distinguish different\nkinds of minds? Various authors have distinguished between\n\u2018primary\u2019 and \u2018higher order\u2019 consciousness\n(Seth et al. 2005); \u2018primary\u2019, \u2018secondary\u2019,\nand \u2018tertiary\u2019 consciousness (Panksepp 2005); and\n\u2018core\u2019 and \u2018extended\u2019 consciousness (Damasio\n1999). However, most of these authors seem to correlate phenomenal\nconsciousness, i.e. having any subjective experience at all, with\nprimary or core consciousness. The terms \u201csecondary\u201d and\n\u201ctertiary\u201d are supposed to pick out elaborated forms of\nconsciousness. Hence it is not clear that any of these taxonomies are\nat odds with the idea that phenomenal consciousness itself is binary\n\u2014 either wholly present or wholly absent for a given\nsystem. However, the issue deserves more scrutiny, as it bears on the\nproblems of the distribution and evolutionary origins of\nconsciousness. If consciousness is non-binary, then the distribution\nof consciousness will not be sharply bounded, but will include\ngradations \u2014 some animals may be partially or incompletely\nconscious.\n\n",
