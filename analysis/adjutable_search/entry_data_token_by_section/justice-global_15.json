    "main_text": "Global Environmental Issues\n8. Global Environmental Issues\n\nPatterns of human behavior that destroy habitats, accelerate species\nextinction, exacerbate toxic levels of pollution, degrade the oceans,\ncontribute to ozone layer destruction, or increase population levels\nare all issues of global environmental concern (Armstrong 2022;\nGardiner 2011; Gardiner, Caney, Jamieson, Shue, and Pachauri 2010).\nHowever, although there are many global environmental topics that are\nrightly concerns of global justice, there is one that dominates\ndiscussion and that concerns our responsibilities with respect to\nclimate change. Here we focus exclusively on this issue.\n\nAmong the scientific community it is no longer controversial that\nanthropogenic climate change is real and a significant threat to the\nwell-being of both current and future generations. But it is also\nwidely acknowledged that human development is an important way to\naddress high levels of global poverty, that such development is energy\nintensive, and the cheapest sources of energy available are not likely\nto be clean energy types. These considerations significantly affect\nefforts to deal with problems presented by climate change. There is\nmuch discussion about the principles that should inform a fair treaty\naimed at dealing with addressing climate change that also gives\nappropriate weight to concerns for human development (Shue 2014;\nAthanasiou et al. 2022). Some of the main contenders include\nprinciples that recognize causal responsibility for high emission\nlevels, principles that are sensitive to ability to pay, and ones\naccording to which those who have benefited from emissions should now\nbe expected to absorb more costs.\n\nWe have not all contributed equally to the problems created by\nemissions; industrialized nations have contributed historically at\nmuch higher levels than those that are still developing. And so we\nshould endorse the guidelines that those who have polluted more should\npay more to help redress current problems (The Polluter Pays\nPrinciple). However critics argue that this principle unfairly holds\nsome responsible when they did not know they were causing harm, since\nit was not widely known that greenhouse gases could result in climate\nchange prior to 1990. So on this view, responsibility for emissions\nprior to 1990 should not conform with the Polluter Pays Principle,\neven if it is used to allocate costs after 1990. Others reply that\ncountries can still be liable for causing harm even if they lack moral\nresponsibility for doing so (Shue 2014). A second principle that is\noften discussed is The Beneficiary Pays Principle. Those who live in\nindustrialized countries have typically benefited greatly from high\nlevels of emissions so it is not unfair if they are expected to pay a\nhigher proportion of costs. Critics object that a history of\nbenefiting is an insufficiently strong consideration for assigning\nresponsibilities now: in many cases whether or not people benefit is\nlargely outside of their control. According to a third popular\nprinciple, The Ability to Pay Principle, the capacity of agents to pay\nfor costs associated with mitigating climate change should be\nrelevant. Again, some object that the ability to pay is a poor\nprinciple for assigning responsibility.\n\nMore recently, philosophers have evaluated different proposals for not\nonly mitigating and distributing the costs of climate change but also\nadaptation to its diverse effects (Gosseries 2004; Vanderheiden 2008;\nGardiner, Caney, Jamieson, Shue, and Pachauri 2010; Blomfield 2019;\nShue 2014, 2021; Brooks 2020). Moreover, they have considered how we\ncan mobilize hope in the face of the seemingly tragic consequences of\nour failures to both address the challenges of climate change and\nhuman development in a timely manner (Moellendorf 2022; Cripps 2022;\nMalm 2021; Mckinnon 2022). Some of this work connects to important\ndebates about feasibility and institutional mechanisms for addressing\nclimate change fairly (Caney 2020; Gheaus 2013; Gilabert and\nLawford-Smith 2012). For more on climate justice see the entries on\n climate justice\n and\n climate science\n (Parker 2018; Caney 2022). Comprehensive treatment of climate justice\nrequires addressing the issue of responsibilities to future\ngenerations (Meyer and Gossieries 2009). For important treatment of\nour responsibilities to other generations see the entry on\n intergenerational justice.\n",
