    "main_text": "Empiricism and Scientific Method\n4. Empiricism and Scientific Method\n\n\nAnother significant difference between Cartesian and Gassendist views\nof God is that for the latter there is no divine epistemic\nguarantor\u2014indeed, for Gassendi, there is no absolute or\nnecessary guarantee on our epistemic access altogether. There is only\nthe contingent warrant of the senses. In the textbook account of the\nearly modern debate among empiricists and rationalists, Gassendi plays\na bit part in promoting the senses as the ultimate source of our\nworldly knowledge. His views are painted as a vanguard but ultimately\ninconsequential Continental counter to Descartes and as a slight\ninfluence on Locke's more \u2018mature\u2019 empiricism.  Gassendi's\ncontribution is more noteworthy than all that, however. His theory of\nknowledge explicitly addresses historical traditions in epistemology,\ndevelops a proto-reliabilist theory of epistemic warrant, wrestles\nwith timeless difficulties of empiricism, and forms the basis of a set\nof allied views on the nature of scientific investigation.\n\n\nThe need for a theory of empirical knowledge in Gassendi's view stems\nfrom the inadequacy of past and contemporary responses to the\nSkeptics, whose puzzles he finds particularly compelling in the form\nof the tropes as presented by Sextus Empiricus. The Skeptical tropes\ncall our attention to the general problem of whether, given the\nfallibility of the senses, any knowledge is possible and in\nwhat the warrant for such would consist. Gassendi turns the problem\naround, limiting its scope to finding warrant for empirical knowledge\nand declaring the special solution to resolve the general case. His\nsignificant move in this regard is to propose, against the Stoics\n(and, as we have seen, Descartes), that it is not a necessary\ncondition of our knowing some claim that we be certain of it. This\nprobabilism immediately broadens the range of what we can know through\nthe senses\u2014as does his suggestion that we include among such\nclaims to knowledge those assertions about what may be hidden to the\nsenses yet legitimately inferred from evidence of the perceptually\ngiven. This is his theory of sign-based inference, which suggests such\ninferences are legitimate just in case they would be agreed to by a\ngreat enough number of experts giving testimony\u2014or else would be\nfalse only on pain of contradiction.\n\n\nFollowing an Epicurean, physicalist model, Gassendi recommends that\nSkeptical worries are satisfied by truth-criteria and elements of\nepistemic warrant rooted in the regularity and reliability of our\nsensory perception and formation of ideas. Trustworthy evidence from\nthe senses yields warrant for empirical beliefs, albeit without\ncertainty and just in case the evidence for them does not conflict\nwith accepted evidentiary experiences. These claims are built upon the\nproposals that sensory information has a material form (in the case of\nvision, Gassendi promotes an atomist theory of effluxions bearing\nimages or light from the viewed object to the viewer), that the mind\nreceives sensory information through a wholly physical process, and\nthat some cognitive faculties dependably allow us to detect truth\nproperties of the objects of knowledge. The physical process\nunderlying this perceptual account is inspired by Epicurus but the\nphysiological details, optics of light transmission, and\nepistemological lessons are strictly Gassendi's own. Indeed, this\naccount of justification marks him not merely as a proponent of a\ncausal theory (as may be said of Descartes, relative to the divine\nepistemic guarantor) but as an early champion of a reliabilist\napproach to the causal processes, claiming them as the source of\nepistemic warrant.\n\n\nThe negative side of Gassendi's theory of knowledge bows in the\ndirection of the classical Skeptics: we cannot be conclusively certain\nabout, nor find ultimate truths among, empirical beliefs. The positive\nside rejects an absolute Skeptical doubt, however, suggesting that\nempirical knowledge is possible because we can identify a range of\nstrengths that are normally associated with many beliefs about\nappearances\u2014their reliability, approximation to the truth, and\nlikelihood by degrees. This approach\u2014what Popkin calls the\nvia media of Gassendi, the \u2018constructive\u2019\nskepticist\u2014suggests a practicable if approximate understanding\nof the world is within our grasp.\n\n\nThis adumbrated version of empiricism is not without difficulties, as\nGassendi is first to recognize. For one, having extended the warrant\nfor the directly sensed to the indirectly sensed, we must find a way\nto confidently adduce evidence on behalf of what appears before the\nsenses in indirect fashion only. For another, the supposition that\nsolving for empirical knowledge presents a solution for all knowledge\nintroduces the challenge of accounting for at least two apparent\ncounterintuitive instances\u2014knowledge of abstracta and knowledge\nof God and the cosmos (Gassendi subsumes the former to empirical\nknowledge on proto-Millian grounds, but exempts most theological and\ncosmological truth from empirical grasp (O II 398-424,\n440-42)). Finally, he calls our attention to the recursive nature of\nempiricist doubts. If a lack of adequate sensory data strips away\nwarrant for knowledge of the world then an empiricist theory of\nknowledge must also appeal to what the senses tell us, about what we\ncan know of the world. The challenge, then, is to fashion an\nempirically adequate theory of acquiring sensory data. In formulating\nsuch an account, he anticipates crucial elements of later reliabilist\ntheories of warrant.\n\n\nOn the basis of these global views of knowledge in general, Gassendi\ndevelops elements of a theory of knowledge and method specific to the\nscientific endeavor. These elements include the proposal that we\nattain and justify empirical claims with the greatest warrant by\ndeduction\u2014yet those claims are at root probabilistic. He further\nproposes that we maintain hypotheses as the basis of scientific\nreasoning so long as there is empirical evidence for them, however\nbroadly construed. Taken together, these elements constitute a\ncommitment to a hypothetico-deductivism (H-D) which is characteristic\nof some instances of actual scientific reasoning that Gassendi\ndiscusses. This is not a typical or modern species of H-D method,\nhowever, firmly wedded as it is to his empiricism. Indeed, Gassendi's\nmethod cannot be adequately characterized in its entirety in this\nfashion, given the several other forms of non-deductive\ninference that he endorses or makes use of as fundamental to his\nscientific method, including sign-based inference, analogous\nreasoning, and inference to the best explanation.\n\n\nA further element of Gassendi's scientific method consists in his\nappeals to indirect evidence for claims about the unobservable, and\nhis willingness to count such evidence as adequate empirical grounds\nfor maintaining viable hypotheses. The most prominent instance of this\nstrategy is his embrace of an atomist matter theory as a \u2018most\nlikely hypothesis\u2019. Of necessity, any evidence on behalf of this\nhypothesis is to be found in the indirect form of\n\u2018indicative\u2019 signs\u2014these are the surface level\nphenomena for which he takes the existence of atoms to be a sine\nqua non condition. A paramount instance of such evidence in his\nview is what we may see through the microscope, when the visual\nphenomena are explicable only given the existence of the\nmicro-structures we perceive\u2014and in turn those are explicable\nonly in terms of yet smaller structures. Gassendi maintains that the\nmicroscopic observations of crystalline formation and dissolution\ndemonstrate the molecular structure of matter, a key aspect of his\natomism. Equally innovative is his appeal to this putative source of\nwarrant in support of his matter theory.\n\n\nSuch arguments for atomism highlight Gassendi's anticipation of the\nmodern notion of inference to the best explanation (IBE) as a means of\njudging among competing hypotheses. In advancing this strategy, he\nemphasizes the capacity of a given hypothesis to account for a range\nof different phenomena as a guide to the degree to which that\nhypothesis approximates the truth. This strategy for justifying claims\nabout atoms also reaffirms his reliance on empirical data in seeking\nconfirmation of claims regarding the evident and nonevident\nalike. While much is untenable or unlikely about these views, Gassendi\nhas at least offered a set of proposals towards resolving one of\nempiricism's more vexing questions\u2014how to transcend the bounds\nof sensory data. We can know about unobservables like atoms, he\nproposes, just in case our empiricism advances scientific knowledge\nthrough hypothetical reasoning and warrants the sorts of inferences\nabout physical phenomena allowing for unseen features of the\nworld\u2014for which the sensible features can provide evidence.\n",
