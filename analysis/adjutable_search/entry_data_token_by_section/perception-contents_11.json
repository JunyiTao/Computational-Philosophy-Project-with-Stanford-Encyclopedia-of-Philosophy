    "main_text": "The Representation of Properties\n4. The Representation of Properties\n\nIf experiences have accuracy conditions, then it is natural to think\nof those conditions as conditions under which certain objects\nhave certain properties. For instance, experiences seem to\nattribute properties to ordinary objects such as people, fish,\nbottles, shoes and the like: the bottle feels round to haptic touch;\nthe shoes make clicking sounds as they hit the floor; a person\u2019s\nface looks to be only 3 feet away and angry; the fish smells and\ntastes fishy. Taking \u2018object\u2019 in a broader sense, the\nattribution of properties to objects seems even more widespread:\nauditory experience can present sounds as loud;\nproprioception can present pains as throbbing; kinesthetic\nexperience can present one\u2019s toes as cold and wiggling;\nvisual experience can present an entire expanse as bright\npink; haptic-tactile experience can present a surface as\nsmooth. Contents of experience, then, often seem to have a predicative\nstructure, involving objects (in either narrow or broad senses) and\nproperties. It then seems possible to theorize separately about the\naccuracy conditions that concern the properties things appear\nto have, on the one hand; and the accuracy conditions that concern the\nobjects or things that appear to have the properties. The\nrest of section 4 will focus on accuracy conditions associated with\nproperties; accuracy conditions associated with objects will be\ndiscussed in\n Section 5.\n\nWhen the accuracy-conditions of an experience require that a certain\nproperty is instantiated, the experience represents that property. For\ninstance, if the experience one has when seeing a grape is accurate\nonly if the grape is green, then the experience represents the\nproperty of being green.\n",
