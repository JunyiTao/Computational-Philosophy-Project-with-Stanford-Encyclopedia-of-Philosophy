    "main_text": "The Topoi || The Ingredients and the Function of Topoi\n7.3 The Ingredients and the Function of Topoi\n\nA typical topos in Aristotle\u2019s dialectic runs as\nfollows: \u201cAgain, if the accident of a thing has a contrary, see\nwhether it belongs to the subject to which the accident in question\nhas been declared to belong: for if the latter belongs, the former\ncould not belong; for it is impossible that contrary predicates should\nbelong at the same time to the same thing\u201d (Topics\n113a20\u201324). Like most topoi, it includes (i) a sort of\ngeneral instruction (\u201csee, whether \u2026\u201d); further it\nmentions (ii) an argumentative scheme\u2014in the given example, the\nscheme \u2018if the accidental predicate p belongs to the\nsubject s, then the opposed P* cannot belong to\ns too\u2019. Finally, the topos refers to (iii) a\ngeneral rule or principle (\u201cfor it is impossible,\n\u2026\u201d) which justifies the given scheme. Other\ntopoi often include the discussion of (iv) examples; still\nother topoi suggest (v) how to apply the given\nschemes.\u2014Though these are elements that regularly occur in\nAristotelian topoi, there is nothing like a standard form\nwith which all topoi conform. Often Aristotle is very brief\nand leaves it to the reader to add the missing elements.\n\nIn a nutshell, the function of a topos can be explained as\nfollows. First of all, one has to select an apt topos for a\ngiven conclusion. The conclusion is either a thesis of the opponent\nthat someone wishes to refute, or it is the assertion someone wishes\nto establish or defend. Accordingly, there are two uses of\ntopoi: they can either prove or disprove a given sentence;\nsome can be used for both purposes, others for only one of them. In\nAristotle\u2019s dialectic, most topoi are topic-neutral and\nneed hence be selected by certain linguistic, semantic or logical\nfeatures of the given conclusion; if, for example, the conclusion\nmaintains a definition, one has to select a topos from a list\nof topoi pertaining to definitions, etc. Once the\ndialectician or rhetorician has selected a topos that is\nappropriate for a given conclusion, the topos can be used to\nconstrue a premise from which the given conclusion can be derived. If\nfor example the argumentative scheme is \u2018If a predicate is\ngenerally true of a genus, then the predicate is also true of any\nspecies of that genus\u2019, we can derive the conclusion \u2018the\ncapacity of nutrition belongs to plants\u2019 using the premise\n\u2018the capacity of nutrition belongs to all living things\u2019,\nsince \u2018living thing\u2019 is the genus of the species\n\u2018plants\u2019. If the construed premise is accepted, either by\nthe opponent in a dialectical debate or by the audience of a public\nspeech, we can draw the intended conclusion. In the Rhetoric\nthough the situation is slightly different (see below\n \u00a7 7.4),\n because here the topic-neutral type of topoi that was\nprevalent in the Topics seems to play a secondary role. Many\ntopoi of the Rhetoric seem to be rather\n\u2018material\u2019 in the sense that they are only useful for\nestablishing conclusions of a certain content; this is why the\nappropriate topos here cannot be selected by formal criteria,\nbut must be chosen in accordance with the content of the envisaged\nconclusion\u2014whether, for example, something is said to be useful\nor honourable or just, etc.\n\nIt has been disputed whether the topos (or, more precisely,\nthe \u2018if \u2026, then \u2026\u2019 scheme that is included\nin a topos) that we use to construe an argument must itself\nbe regarded as a further premise of the argument. It could be either,\nas some say, the premise of a propositional scheme such as the modus\nponens, or, as others assume, as the conditional premise of a\nhypothetical syllogism. Aristotle himself does not favour one of these\ninterpretations explicitly. But even if he regarded the topoi\nas additional premises in a dialectical or rhetorical argument, it is\nbeyond any doubt that he did not use them as premises that must be\nexplicitly mentioned or even approved by the opponent or audience.\n",
