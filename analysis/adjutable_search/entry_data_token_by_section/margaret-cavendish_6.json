    "main_text": "Social and Political Philosophy\n7. Social and Political Philosophy\n\nAn issue of interpretation that arises in the attempt to reconstruct\nCavendish\u2019s social and political philosophy is that for the most part\nthe texts in which she addresses social and political questions are\nnot formal philosophical treatises but works of fiction. What is\nregarded as her central work on political philosophy, Description\nof a New World, Called the Blazing World, is a novel, and in\nanother central text, Orations of Divers Sorts, Cavendish\npresents a multiplicity of opposing perspectives on social and\npolitical topics: gender roles, virtue, war, and the proper form of\ngovernment, among others. Cavendish is indeed the author of\nBlazing World, and she also makes an appearance as a\ncharacter, but it is difficult to be certain that all of the\nconclusions and insights of the narrator are ones that Cavendish would\nidentify as her own. The interpretive problem is even worse in the\ncase of Orations, as there are as many as three or four\nspeeches that are offered on any given subject, and the speeches are\nin some cases contradictory. Still, there are a few texts in which\nCavendish puts forward claims about social and political matters and\nin which she is clearly speaking in her own voice \u2014 in\nparticular, World\u2019s Olio. We can use these claims to\ndetermine which of the perspectives she is endorsing in her more\nfictional work and to get a concrete sense of how she might follow up\non these (Boyle 2006, 253\u2013254).\n\nCavendish disagrees with Hobbes on a number of questions of natural\nphilosophy. For Hobbes, thoughts and sensations are motions in the\nbrain (Hobbes 1651, 27\u201328). For Cavendish thinking and\nintelligence are basic features of bodies \u2013 they are basic\nfeatures that are ubiquitous in nature and that admit of no further\nexplanation. Nor would Hobbes agree with Cavendish that when bodies\ninteract their rational elements communicate with each other and\nco-ordinate their behavior. But on questions of social and political\nphilosophy Cavendish and Hobbes to a significant degree align. Like\nHobbes, Cavendish holds that human beings are primarily motivated by\nself-interest:\n\nSelf-love is the ground from which springs all Indeavours and\nIndustry, Noble Qualities, Honourable Actions, Friendships, Charity,\nand Piety, and is the cause of all Passions, Affections, Vices and\nVirtues; for we do nothing, or think not of any thing, but hath a\nreference to our selves in one kind or other. (Cavendish 1655, 145)\n\n\nShe adds that self-love is \u201cthe strongest Motion of the\nMind\u201d (Ibid.). Also like Hobbes, Cavendish thinks that life\noutside of civil society is so dangerous and chaotic that it does not\nallow us to pursue our self-interest in a stable and consistent way.\nOutside of civil society, we cannot secure food or shelter without\nthreat that they will be taken; we do not have, and we cannot create\nand sustain, the infrastructure that enables commerce; we cannot make\nplans; and the bulk of our energy is expended on security and safety\nin the moment. Orations offers multiple perspectives on\nsocial and political issues, but the emphasis on social stability is a\nconstant (Boyle 2006, 258 and 282\u2013286):\n\nIf [there is] no safety [there is] no propriety, either of goods,\nwives, children nor lives, and if there be no propriety there will be\nno husbandry and the lands will lie unmanured; also there will be\nneither trade nor traffic, all which will cause famine, war, and ruin,\nand such a confusion as the kingdom will be like a chaos. (Cavendish\n1662a, 70)\n\n\nAs for Hobbes, for Cavendish the stability of civil society is not an\nend in itself; it is instead a necessary condition for us to pursue\nour self-interested projects and goals. If we remained in a state of\nnature, we would be in perpetual fear. We would not be likely to live\nvery long, and we would not live well. We would not be healthy. We\nwould not be able develop our latent skills and abilities, and we\nwould not be able to engage in the activities of which those skills\nand abilities are an expression.\n\nCavendish also agrees with Hobbes that civil society is most stable\nand secure when it is ruled by a single individual who has absolute\npower and sovereignty (Lewis 2001, 345; Boyle 2006, 282). She\nwrites,\n\nThis Commonwealth to be governed by one Head or Governour, as a King,\nfor one Head is sufficient for one Body: for several Heads breed\nseveral Opinions, and several Opinions breed Disputations, and\nDisputations Factions, and Factions breed Wars, and Wars bring ruin\nand Desolation; for it is more safe to be governed, though by a\nFoolish Head, than a Factious Heart. (Cavendish 1655, 205\u2013206)\n\n\nIf a sovereign is to have absolute power, there is some risk of course\nthat they might use that power unwisely and in a way that does not\noptimally promote peace and stability. Cavendish is more worried\nhowever about all of the alternatives. For example, democracy is not a\nsustainable option:\n\nthe common people is not only Insolent, when they have Power,\nCommanding Imperiously, Condemning Unjustly, Advancing Unworthily, but\nthey are so Inconstant, as there is no Assurance in them, and so\nFoolish, as they Know not what to Choose. (Cavendish 1662a, 278)\n\n\nIf the security and order of civil society is left in the hands of the\nmajority, or in the hands of a person who is selected by the majority,\nthere is too high a risk that society will return to chaos. Cavendish\nalso holds that power should not be in the hands of a smaller but very\ntalented and intelligent and sophisticated minority: she appears to\nthink that the likelihood is high that such a body will become divided\nand govern ineffectively, perhaps because \u201cIt is the nature of\nmost of Mankind \u2026 to be Ungratefull, Malicious, Revengefull,\nand Inhumane\u201d (Cavendish 1662a, 259). The members of such a body\nmight be in perpetual conflict as a result of honest disagreement or\nas a result of their ambition to have more power for themselves.\nCavendish concludes that the best prospect for security and stability\n\u2014 though to be sure this is not a guarantee \u2014 is to\nhave all power in the hands of a single\n individual.[37]\n\nCavendish does not get into a lot of detail about how the sovereign\nshould best bring about peace and security, but she does offer a\nnumber of suggestions. In Blazing World, she depicts a scene\nin which the Empress returns to her home world (from the Blazing\nWorld) and saves her people from an enemy attack. The Empress is\ndepicted as possessing super-human abilities, as having the\nall-encompassing breadth and reach and power of a god:\n\nWhich sight, when her countrymen perceived at a distance, their hearts\nbegan to tremble; but coming something nearer, she left her torches,\nand appeared only in her garments of light, like an angel, or some\ndeity, and all kneeled down before her, and worshipped her with all\nsubmission and reverence: but the Empress would not come nearer than\nat such a distance where her voice might be generally heard, by reason\nshe would not have that of her accoutrements anything else should be\nperceived, but the splendour thereof. \u2026 But, good Lord! what\nseveral opinions and judgments did this produce in the minds of her\ncountry-men; some said she was an angel; others, she was a sorceress;\nsome believed her a goddess; others said the devil deluded them in the\nshape of a fine lady. (96)\n\n\nWhile still on Blazing World, the Empress had received intelligence\nthat her people were under attack and that their kingdom was likely to\nbe destroyed (90). The clear suggestion is that peace and security are\nbest secured and maintained if a country is governed by a sovereign\nwho is and is believed to be capable of the extraordinary. The\nsovereign should not be selected by democracy, and ideally the\nsovereign will be one of the few who is naturally born with the\ntalents that are requisite to do the job:\n\nLet me Advise you to Choose one that is Born a King, and Bred a King,\nwho will Rule and Govern Magnificently, Majestically, Heroically, as a\nKing ought to Do. (Cavendish 1662b, 283)\n\n\nIt is difficult to resist the thought that Cavendish is writing in\npart with an eye to Hobbes and the problem of the fool (Hobbes 1651,\n90). To the subject who thinks that it is rational to break the\ncovenants of civil society, and who thinks that he can get away with\nit, Cavendish is suggesting that a capable sovereign would make sure\nthat subjects have reason to believe that the eyes and ears of the\nsovereign are ubiquitous and that situations in which a subject\nconcludes that he is under the radar are likely to be situations\nthat the sovereign has had skillfully and majestically staged. Perhaps\nCavendish is also suggesting that there is no good Hobbesian response\nto the problem of the fool in that she is fleshing out what a\nsovereign would have to be to make the behavior of the\n\u201cfool\u201d count as irrational, and how a sovereign cannot\nrealistically be anything close to that.\n\nCavendish also does not speak in a lot of detail about how a sovereign\nis established or about the formation of a commonwealth. She appears\nto assume that a sovereign will emerge from the among the most\npowerful and talented and that the majority of people will come to see\nsubjugation as in their overall interest. She does however sketch some\nparameters that she thinks a wise sovereign will keep in mind, and\nthese parameters tend to be in keeping with her occasionalist view\nthat things or persons have power not as a function of what they force\nonto their objects but as a function of whether or not these objects\nrespond to the person or thing as requested. For example, Cavendish\nsays that a wise sovereign will be fair and consistent in the\napplication and enforcement of laws (Cavendish 1655, 112). The\nsovereign will also be a model of virtue, and in a way that allows his\nor her subjects to register that the highest forms of happiness and\npleasure do not in fact accompany the life of vice. (Cavendish 1664b,\n114) A wise sovereign will also make sure that subjects have access to\nletters and to education more generally \u2014 to poetry that softens\nour animalistic and reactive side (Cavendish 1655, 64); to plays and\nother representations that not only articulate and defend but also\nexhibit the virtues and joys that come with enacting them; and also\nphilosophy and history (Cavendish 1655, 6). Cavendish writes,\n\nthe mind will be Wild and Barbarous, unless it be inclosed with Study,\nInstructed by Learning, and Governed by Knowledg and Understanding,\nfor then the Inhabitants of the Mind will live Peaceably, Happily,\nHonestly, and Honourably, by which they will Rule and Govern their\nassociate Appetites with Ease and Regularity. (Cavendish 1664b, 51)\n\n\nOne of the benefits of an education is that our minds become more\nfilled with information that helps us to navigate the world \u2014\nnot only to achieve our local aims but to work toward the more global\nresult of peace and security (Boyle 2006, 285\u2013287). Cavendish\ndoes not think that we can achieve these aims blindly and by a brute\nact of will. We need knowledge and familiarity with the ways of the\nworld, and we cannot come up with these by a brute act of will\neither. Ecosystems and other collections of bodies are able to\nsustain themselves in existence, in large part because of the skillful\ncommunication that takes place between their members. A commonwealth\nwill have a better chance of surviving for the long haul if its\nmembers are prepared to listen to each other and if they are in\nsynchrony with respect to a larger aim and if they have the\nwherewithal to respond to each other intelligently and without\nresistance.\n\nCavendish would also recommend that a sovereign hold constant the\nextent to which human beings are driven by the pursuit of public\nrecognition and fame. Cavendish herself thinks that our material minds\ndo not live on after we die and that, if we have immaterial souls that\ncontinue to exist, we have absolutely no notion of these or how or why\nwe would identify with them. She thinks that deep down the rest of us\nare suspicious as well:\n\nperceiving \u2026 that their after-life cannot be the same as their\npresent life is, they endeavour \u2026 that their Society may remain\nin remembrance amongst the particular and general Societies of the\nsame sort of Creatures, which we name Mankind: and this design causes\nall the Sensitive and Rational Parts, in one Society, to be\nindustrious, to leave some Mark for a lasting Remembrance, amongst\ntheir fellow-Creatures: which general resemblance, Man calls Fame.\n(Cavendish 1668b, 75\u201376)\n\n\nCavendish is very astute to point out the extent to which human beings\nare motivated by a desire for public recognition. She saw the evidence\nin her own day, and we can clearly see it in our\n own.[38]\n She can then argue that if generally speaking people are interested\nin the promotion of peace and stability, one of the ways that an\nindividual will have a good chance at achieving fame is by engaging in\nactivities and projects that help to secure peace and stability. These\nwould include inventions, infrastructure, and the construction of\nschools and libraries (Boyle 2006, 264). A wise sovereign will make\nsure that such behavior is encouraged and that it is also\nacknowledged. Not everybody is noble and exalted and impressive by\nbirth, and not everybody has all of the same talents (Cavendish 1655,\n69; Cavendish 1662a, 27, 37\u201338), but there are still a number of\nways that any human being can contribute to peace and stability.\nSociety can be structured so that people can operate in line\nwith their own talents and be acknowledged for what they do well\n\u2014 whether they be scientists, philosophers, laborers, members of\nthe military, writers, or something else \u2014 and a wise sovereign\nwould recognize all of these achievements so that a person would not\nbe motivated to secure fame in ways that are more unseemly. We are\nremembered well if we do our part to promote peace and social\nstability. And it is only if society lives on, and is stable and\norderly and civilized, that there will be people who might remember\nus.\n\nAnother issue that comes up in interpreting Cavendish\u2019s social and\npolitical philosophy is whether or not she is a feminist. It is\ntempting again to look to her view on occasional causation to shed\nlight on her view of the proper roles for females and males. Cavendish\nherself wanted to be a practicing scientist and philosopher, but\nwhether or not she could be so was a function not only of her\ndecisions but also of the receptivity of the surrounding world. She\ncould decide to be a scientist, but whether or not she would be a\nscientist is up to a lot of additional factors \u2014 whether her\nresults are disseminated and discussed, whether they are published,\nwhether she is taken seriously and seen as authoritative, and whether\nshe is part of a larger scientific community. Alternately, she (or a\nCavendish in a nearby possible world) might decide to open a business,\nor be a constable or barrister, but whether or not she is successful\nwould depend only in part on what she decides to do. To be a\nbusinessperson she would need to have a customer base, and to be an\nattorney she would need to be authoritative and believable in front of\nthose who deliver a verdict. Cavendish was not a prominent scientist\nin her time; nor was she a prominent philosopher. She attempted to\ncorrespond with Hobbes and others, but unlike the bodies that interact\nin constituting the ecosystems of nature and other organic units,\nthese philosophers were not cooperative.\n\nIn her natural philosophy Cavendish argues that the behavior of bodies\nis due in part to messages that are signaled from the\n\u201cagent\u201d body and in part to the response of the\n\u201cpassive\u201d body and to whether or not the\n\u201cpassive\u201d body is appropriately hospitable. Some of\nher texts suggest very strongly that her social and political\nphilosophy is informed by her view of the normal operations of nature.\nIn Blazing World, the Empress is transported from her home\nplanet and is pleased to find that the beings on the Blazing World\nwill interact with her and respect her authority. In real life, the\nhuman men on earth would not engage with Cavendish, but the\nworm-men and bear-men and bird-men and fish-men and ape-men have\nextensive conversations with the Empress about the cosmos, the nature\nof matter and mind, chemistry, and mathematics (29\u201342). At one\npoint the Empress seeks counsel from \u201cthe soul of one of the\nmost famous modern writers, as either of Galileo, Gassendus,\nDescartes, Helmont, Hobbes, H. More, etc.\u201d (67\u201368). She is\ninformed, however, that \u201cthey would scorn to be scribes to a\nwoman\u201d (68). The atmosphere of the Blazing World is quite\ndifferent from the atmosphere on earth, and whether or not a person is\na scientist or philosopher or other authority is only in part\ndependent on what is happening on her end.\n\nCavendish presents women as accomplished and successful in other texts\nas well. In Bell in Campo, Cavendish has a group of women\nform an army for the sake of showing men that women should be\n\u201cco-partners\u201d in government, and \u201chelp rule the\nWorld\u201d (588\u2013589). The women submit to a powerful\ngeneralless, and together they defeat the enemy and save the male army\nat the same time. The events in Bell in Campo are fairly\nstraightforward, but there might remain a question about Cavendish\u2019s\nown attitude toward those events, and in particular about her attitude\ntoward the achievements of the female army. On the one hand, it is\nreported in Bell in Campo that men take women to be \u201ca\ntrouble in the Commonwealth\u201d (588). In addition, the members of\nthe female army are rewarded for their achievements \u2014 rewarded\nby the men in power \u2014 with the right to control their family\nfinances, and the freedom to wear whatever they choose. On the other\nhand, Cavendish depicts the female army as being capable of doing what\na male army is normally commissioned to do, and as capable of doing\neven more. Furthermore, she is depicting how males in power would in\nfact respond (or how the males in her own world have responded) to a\ncircumstance in which a female army sweeps in to save the day. On one\nreading, Cavendish herself is suggesting that men and women are not\nequal in terms of the roles that they should perform and that men are\nin important ways superior. On another reading, Cavendish is\nreflecting that men are not superior to women but that the\nachievements of women have always occurred in an atmosphere in which\nmen are heavily advantaged.\n\nSome commentators have suggested that Cavendish leaves open the\nquestion of whether or not women are inferior by training and\neducation or if they are inferior by nature (for example Boyle 2006,\n278\u2013281). It seems unlikely that Cavendish thinks that women are\ninferior by nature if she depicts women as capable of the highest\nlevels of achievement in alternative possible worlds. Women are still\nwomen in these alternative worlds; what is different is the\nstructure of the surrounding audiences with which men and women have\nto contend. Cavendish herself was a remarkable person, as was the\nEmpress and the generalless of Bell in Campo. It is true that\nwomen are depicted as exceptional only in Cavendish\u2019s fictional work\n(McGuire 1978, 198; Boyle 2006, 279), and that might indicate that she\ntakes the idea of a skilled and capable woman to be fictional, but as\nper her view on occasional causation she might just be reflecting in\nthese alternative worlds that what it is for an agent to be successful\nis in part due to what the agent signals and in part to how its larger\nenvironment is responsive. Cavendish might have thought (with Spinoza)\nthat no individual is an island and that what an\nindividual can do and cannot do is to some degree a part of its\nphysical and psychological constitution and to a large degree a part\nof the lay of the land on which the individual would act.\n\nCavendish does however encourage a very conservative set of behaviors\nfor women to perform, and again the question arises of whether she is\nbasing her view on some assumptions about the nature of women more\ngenerally or if she has an eye to the environment in which women have\nhappened to find themselves. In World\u2019s Olio she emphasizes\nthe importance of the virtue of chastity, and also patience, humility\nand being fashionable and constant (73). The list is expanded by one\nof the speakers of Orations:\n\nModest, Chast, Temperate, Humble, Patient, and Pious; also to be\nHuswifely, Cleanly, and of few Words, all which will Gain us Praise\nfrom Men, and Blessing from Heaven, and Love in this World, and Glory\nin the Next. (229)\n\n\nHere Cavendish might be reflecting how women ought to behave in any\npossible world irrespective of the power and responses of the beings\nthat surround them. If she thinks that the nature of women is such\nthat women should be chaste and humble and quiet, then to the extent\nthat she thinks that other characteristics are higher and more exalted\nshe takes women to be an inferior part of the species. If she is\ninstead reading off of her own world what behaviors are regarded as\nlegitimate for women, then she is just describing the behavior that is\nadaptive to that environment. The generalless of Bell in\nCampo is not especially modest or temperate or quiet, but her\nbehavior would not \u201cgain us praise\u201d or \u201clove in this\nworld\u201d \u2014 the seventeenth-century environment in which\nCavendish thinks we find ourselves. But perhaps Cavendish thinks that\nthe generalless is operating counter to her own nature. Alternately,\nif Cavendish is reading off of her culture how women would be most\nwise to behave, then she might just be offering conservative advice\nabout how women can best flourish in the short material life that has\nbeen allotted to them.\n\nA final interpretive issue that arises for Cavendish is exactly how\nthe sovereign is supposed to have so much power and authority if power\nand achievement are in large part a function of the responsiveness of\nthe surrounding world. A sufficiently powerful sovereign would have to\nhave full control of the military and other underlings, and these in\nturn would need to be able to control the larger populace (James 2003,\nxxv\u2013xxvi). The sovereign would have to have enough power to force all\nof these people to act in accord with his or her will, but in the\nlight of her view on occasional causation Cavendish is committed to\nthe view that all that a sovereign would be able to do is send a\nsignal or message to these beings in the hope that they would obey.\nThe sovereign might try to take steps to increase the odds that\nunderlings will abide by his message, but that would be a matter of\nsending another message still. A sovereign cannot simply decree that\ncertain things happen: whether or not they happen is a function of the\nresponsiveness of the members of the commonwealth. For Cavendish, an\necosystem holds together, but not because a single member imposes its\nwill on the others. Instead, the members work together as a group, and\nif human beings are a part of nature, they would function under the\nsame constraints. If Cavendish is right, a sovereign has to be\nextremely powerful to secure peace and stability, but what it is for a\nsovereign to have power is to be wise enough to figure out which are\nthe messages that his subjects would accommodate (also Walters 2014,\n180\u2013182)\n",
