    "main_text": "The Epistemological Role of Intuitions || Intuitions as Evidence: Intuiteds vs. Intuitings\n2.4 Intuitions as Evidence: Intuiteds vs. Intuitings\n\nThe previous sections have aimed to show that much philosophical\ninquiry depends in significant ways on intuitions as evidence or\nreasons. However, such a claim is ambiguous. To say that the intuition\nthat p is treated as evidence might be to claim that the\nfact that a person has an intuition is taken to serve as some\nkind of evidence (the intuiting) or it might be to claim that\nthe propositional content of the intuition (the\nintuited) is treated as the evidence.\n\nTreating the intuitings as the exclusive evidence has been\nalleged to overly psychologize philosophy (Pust 2001) and to play into\nthe hands of skeptics of both the armchair and empirical variety\n(Williamson 2007; Deutsch 2010). After all, if one\u2019s ultimate\nevidence is psychological, it can seem a difficult question why such\nstates or events ought to be treated as evidence for claims which are\nnot psychological at all\u2014claims about the nature of knowledge,\nmorality, modality, etc. (For the suggestion that philosophers should\ninstead treat many of their efforts as aiming to explicate the\nstructure and content of our mental representations, see\nGoldman 1999, 2007.)  Furthermore, it doesn\u2019t seem at all\nplausible that most explicit philosophical argument and analysis\nproceeds from psychological premises (i.e., premises about what some\nperson or persons find intuitive). Rather, they appeal to claims\nregarding knowledge, justification, morality, explanation, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, to fail to address the fact that the proposition in\nquestion is intuitive\u2014that it is the content\nof an intuiting\u2014is, it seems, to neglect something\nimportant about one\u2019s apparent justification for believing the\nproposition. While most of our putative evidence in philosophy\nconsists of non-psychological propositions, what qualifies such\npropositions as our evidence must have something to do with\nour epistemic justification for believing them. Even if philosophical\nargumentation rarely includes premises about the intuitiveness of a\nproposition, our justification for accepting the premises in an\nargument is of great importance in determining the ultimate\njustificatory force of the argument.\n\nHence, the view that intuitions are treated as evidence in philosophy\nis best thought of as the view that, with respect to many core\nquestions of philosophy, our justification for believing an answer\nconsists (at least substantially) in our having suitable intuitions.\nIt does not follow that all explicit philosophical reasoning can be\nproperly represented as beginning with propositions stating that we\nhave intuitions of various sorts (that route is self-defeating and\nincapable of accounting for justification by reasoning). Put simply,\nthe view is that the occurrence of an intuiting is taken to\nprovide the person in whom it occurs with prima facie\njustification for believing the intuited. Alternatively, it\nholds that S\u2019s having an intuition that p prima\nfacie justifies S in believing that p. Given a\ncapacious view of evidence, then, both the intuiting and the intuited\nare treated as evidence, the occurrence of the former being treated as\nprima facie non-inferential justification for accepting the\nlatter and the latter as a potential inferential justification for\nfurther propositions.\n\nThose who prefer to focus on knowledge rather than justification can\ntake the claim that intuitions are treated as evidence as the claim\nthat beliefs based on intuition (if intuitions are distinct from\nbeliefs) or intuitive beliefs are usually taken to be knowledge and so\ntaken as evidence for further claims. They may also allow that having\nan intuition that p is, when it is veridical, a way of knowing\nthat p and thereby having p as part of one\u2019s\nevidence (Cath 2012).\n\nThe view that intuitions are treated as evidence in philosophy has\ncome under recent attack by a number of philosophers (Williamson 2007;\nCappelen 2012; Deutsch 2015). The critics seem clearly to wish to deny\nthat philosophical practice treats the having of an intuition as\nprima facie justification for its content, either because\nthey deny that intuitions (at least as characterized by the sui\ngeneris accounts) exist or because they are skeptical that such\nstates could serve as prima facie justification for their\ncontents. Though Williamson, as noted above, suggests he cannot\nintrospectively locate such states, Cappelen and Deutsch largely avoid\nintrospective appeals, arguing instead that attention to philosophical\npractice and writing reveals little evidence of appeals to intuitions.\nInstead, they claim that close attention to influential discussions in\nphilosophy reveals the ultimate source of justification for various\nclaims is to be found in arguments.\n\nThe rejoinder to such a revisionary view of the role of intuitions\ntakes various forms. An understanding of the sort of state at issue\nmay require careful introspection and theorizing of the sort appearing\nabove. Moreover, one may doubt that a given account of the nature of\nintuitions is correct without doubting that intuitions exist. A\nfurther rejoinder would be to argue that much of the written work\ndiscussed by Cappelen and Deutsch features language which is\nplausibly used to designate intuitions and, additionally, that the\nprovision of arguments supporting verdicts regarding various thought\nexperiments is not inconsistent with the author\u2019s taking\n(implicitly or explicitly) intuitions to serve as prima facie\njustification for their contents (Bengson 2014; Devitt 2015).\n",
