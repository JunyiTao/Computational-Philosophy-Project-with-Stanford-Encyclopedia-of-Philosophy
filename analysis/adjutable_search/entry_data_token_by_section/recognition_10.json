    "main_text": "Recognition and Emancipation\n5. Recognition as Ideology?\n\n\nSome authors are not very optimistic about the prospects of\nemancipation through struggles of recognition.  If our expectations of\nbeing recognized as X are always contingent upon the social and\nhistorical context we live in, how is moral and political progress\npossible at all? Is it\u2014in view of our basic dependency on the\nview of others\u2014not more likely that our striving for\nrecognition leads to uncritical conformity instead of an emancipatory\nstruggle for recognition? It is just this suspicion which is expressed\nby the French Marxist Louis Althusser. He regards recognition\nas the central ideological mechanism by which the state\nconfronts its citizens with the choice between obedience and the loss\nof social existence (Althusser 1970, 174\u2013176). Hereby, Althusser\nfollows a specifically French tradition that does not primarily\nconceptualize recognition as the condition of intersubjective freedom,\nbut as a source of estrangement: Already in\nRousseau\u2019s Second Discourse on Inequality (Rousseau\n1755) individuals lose themselves in vain pretense, because they\ninauthentically attempt to please others (for a more positive reading\nsee Neuhouser 2008).  Finally, in the work of Jean-Paul Sartre\nindividuals are reified by every kind of recognition because even the\naffirmation of others freezes the subjects in their present state,\nhereby denying their potential for change, i.e., their freedom (Sartre\n1943, esp. 347\u2013361).  According to this tradition, we do not suffer\nprimarily from the fact that we are not recognized, but rather from\nthe fact that we are held captive within a specific pattern of\nsocially mandated recognition (Bedorf 2010). Struggles for recognition\nonly entangle us ever deeper in a wrong dependency on power relations\nthe workings of which we fail to adequately grasp. Whereas\nleft-Hegelian approaches are designed to positively overcome\nideological recognition orders for the purposes of social progress\n(Honneth 2004), post-structuralists maintain that one should not ask\nwhich features of one\u2019s identity should be recognized. In doing\nso we only remain caught within the old (ideological) categories and\nare forced to define clear-cut identities.  Rather, one should\nquestion struggles for recognition as to whether and to what extent\nthey increase spaces of freedom to think and act differently (Tully\n2000, 469). Such work, often inspired by Michel Foucault, has also\npointed to the motivational problem of all resistance to the\nestablished recognition order: How can you reject exactly those\ncategories that constitute your identity? Does social criticism not\nnecessary imply self-denial? Judith Butler has tried to circumvent\nthis alleged paradox by pointing out that norms never remain valid by\nthemselves but need constant reaffirmation. This process hereby opens\nup possibilities of\u2014at least slightly\u2014\u201creconfiguring\u201d the dominant norms and changing\none\u2019s own identity (Butler 1997a, ch. 3; 1997b, 13, 40\u201341). Some\nauthors even want to replace a politics of recognition with a politics\nof acknowledgment: an acknowledgment that we can never be sure about\nthe changing identities (and thus normative claims) of others but have\nto remain open to new and unpredictable developments (Markell 2003,\n180).  In a similar vein, feminist thinkers have claimed that the\nentire idea of being recognized in one\u2019s given identity makes it\nimpossible for us to gain an adequate understanding of how power and\nagency not simply react to such an identity but rather create it as an\n\u201cembodied\u201d identity in the first place (McNay 2008, 162\u2013197). Finally, the idea that struggles for recognition cannot only lead to further progress, but should be grounded in a belief that modernity is already the result of such progress, has been criticized for its affinity to colonial forms of thought (Allen 2016, cf. Forst 2019).\n\n\nEven those who think that one can\u2014at least conceptually\u2014conceive of non-ideological forms of recognition have started\nto pay more attention to the ways in which relationships of recognition\nare always also relationships of power (see the contributions in van\nden Brink/Owen 2007). This becomes especially urgent if one realizes,\nas already indicated above, that values and norms\u2014being\nproducts of human thought and attitudes\u2014can express disrespect\neven if those who follow them are not really aware of this. Subjects\nmay attempt to convey recognition within a framework that is itself\ndisrespectful. For example, a lord in the 18th century who\ntreated his maid according to the accepted norms of that time\u2014for example, by treating her as if she was invisible\u2014may not\nhave (intentionally) disrespected her with regard to the socially valid\nsystem of norms and values. Thus, he might have been considered a\n\u201cdecent\u201d lord according to prevailing standards (whereas\nother lords might have been described as \u201ccruel\u201d, etc.).\nHowever, at least some probably want to say that this lord\u2014in\nanother sense\u2014did not adequately respect his maid (and that\ntherefore the social changes since then manifest moral progress).\nNonetheless, some authors regard even ideological recognition (as\nbeing, for example, a dutiful maid) as something positive insofar as it\nstrengthens the subject\u2019s sense of worth and is clearly superior\nto acts of misrecognition (Honneth 2004, 323\u2013347). Yet, others may\nmourn such ideological recognition for the incapacitating effects on\nthe recognized subjects\u2019 will to resist. Recently, these controversies have been taken up in a fruitful dialogue between these two traditions (Bankovsky/Le Goff 2013, Honneth/Ranci\u00e8re 2017, Honneth 2018, esp. 211\u2013235).\n\n\nHowever, even if attitudes and acts of recognition are a much more\nambivalent blessing than might have been presumed at first sight,\nrecognition theory does not only illuminate the complexity of our\nnormative thinking but also provides a strong argument that such\nnormative considerations are an ineradicable part of our social world.\nThe concept of recognition therefore also serves an important\nexplanatory function.\n",
