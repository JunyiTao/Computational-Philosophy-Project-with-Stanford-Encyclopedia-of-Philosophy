B. Pompino-Marschall, 2003),\nthose on ethnomusicology (cf. G. Schw\u00f6rer-Kohl, 2011), published\nin his Sammelb\u00e4nde f\u00fcr vergleichende\nMusikwissenschaft, whose fourth volume contains the study on\nRomanian folk music by the famous composer B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k\n(1922\u20131923; V. Lampert, 2008), we owe to Stumpf several studies\non the history of music. (Stumpf, 1885, 1896, 1897, 1911) In his\nautobiography, Stumpf listed his work in this field and stressed the\nimportance of his contribution in two of his works:\n\nTo the systematic science of music belong, besides my works on\nphysical and psychological acoustics, especially the treatise,\nPsychology of Music in England, and the book about the\nbeginnings of music. In the treatise, which is an introduction to the\nlater works on Tonpsychologie, I discussed the relation of\nmusic to language, and that of human speech to the utterances of\nanimals \u2013 with reference to Spencer and Darwin \u2013 but also\nthe exaggerated nativism of Gurney (power of sound), who practically\nignored all genetic explanations and focused only on the erotic\nfeelings of animal ancestors. (Stumpf, 1924, p. 438\u2013439)\n\n\nHis classic work, The Origins of Music, made known notably by\nthe famous anthropologist and linguist Edward Sapir (1912) thanks to\nhis positive review of this work in 1912, has recently been published\nin English. (see E. M. von Hornbostel, 1933; M. M\u00fcller, 2003; A.\nSimon, 2000; H. de la Motte-Haber, 2011) This book is the culmination\nof more than twenty five years of empirical and theoretical research\nin the field of musicology and is divided into two main parts: the\nfirst, entitled \u201cThe Origin and Archetypes of Music\nMaking\u201d deals with the theoretical aspects of the debates at the\ntime on this issue. Three theories on the origin of music are\ndiscussed, namely that of Darwin, that advocated independently by\nRousseau, Herder, and Spencer, and finally that of Wallaschek and K.\nB\u00fccher. All these theories are rejected in favour of that\nproposed by Stumpf in the second chapter entitled \u201cThe Origin\nand Archetypes of Singing.\u201d Stumpf\u2019s theory is based\nmainly on the famous concept of fusion that he developed in his\nPsychology of Sound. The third chapter entitled\n\u201cPrimitive Instruments and their Influence\u201d traces the\nhistory of musical instruments among primitive peoples. In Chapter IV\n\u201cPolyphony, Rhythm, and Intoned,\u201d Stumpf examines the\nmusic of primitive peoples with regard to the forms of polyphony,\nrhythm, and the relation between song and speech. (see Deutsch, Sommer\nand Willam, 2003) The last chapter \u201cPaths of Development\u201d\nconsists in a study of the different stages of the development of\nmusic. The second part of the book, \u201cSongs of Primitive\nPeoples\u201d is a study of music among primitive peoples in\ndifferent countries of the world, and is based on several songs of\nwhich Stumpf offers the transcription and a detailed musical analysis.\n(H. G\u00fcnther, 2003)\n\nMoreover, although Stumpf has devoted only one article specifically to\nthe theme of aesthetics, this topic is raised very frequently in his\nwork, namely in his book Gef\u00fchl und\nGef\u00fchlsempfindung which includes three of his papers on\nemotions and sense feelings (Stumpf, 1928b; C.\nAllesch, 2014, 2003). This issue led to a long discussion in his\ncorrespondence with Brentano on whether pleasure, and aesthetic\npleasure procured by a work of art, is intentional or phenomenal in\nnature. In his article \u201cAesthetic Enjoyment and Tragedy,\u201d\nStumpf summarizes the problem of aesthetics as follows:\n\nEvery work of art bears within itself its primary purpose [which\nconsists] in the production of an aesthetic enjoyment. And here, in\nthis immediate effect, lies the enigma. (Stumpf, 1910a, p. 5)\n\n\nThis action or effect (Wirkung) of the artwork is immediate\nin a way comparable, for instance, to the experience that we have of\npain, and is independent of any difference in culture, specialized\nknowledge of contemplated objects or worldview (historical, cultural\nor other). Stumpf acknowledges that sensations can act aesthetically\non a subject without any conceptual thought or representation.\nHowever, the full aesthetic sentiment is forced upon us when and only\nif sensations and combinations of sensations \u201care entangled in\nan act of relational thinking.\u201d That is to say, \u201can\naesthetic affect presupposes a judgment on a state of affairs, on a\nfact.\u201d (1899, p. 8) The feeling of pleasure is immediately\nlinked to an activity as sensory pleasure to sensations, but it is not\nyet an emotion in the strict sense. For there to be an emotion in the\nexperience of enjoyment (Entz\u00fccken) of a work of art,\nthe relations intuited in a unitary and immediate way must become an\nobject of consciousness, and therefore an intentional object. Hence\nthe dual origin (or source) of aesthetic experience: the first is what\nhe calls the fullness (F\u00fclle) of the formal relations\namong the parts of a true work of art, while the second is derived\nfrom the properties of the object or, more precisely, the state of\naffairs. (Stumpf, 1899, p 8; 1924, p 54) The first source is\nphenomenological and resides in the formal relations which are given\ndirectly to consciousness. The second source is more complex in that\nit presupposes the processing of the phenomena and sensory data\nthrough judgment. (Stumpf, 1926, p. 2\u20133) These two sources,\nhowever, form a unitary content that can only be distinguished by\nabstraction.\n\nThe works and teachings of Stumpf in the field of emotions have had\nsome influence on the literary work of the young Robert Musil. We know\nthat Musil went to Berlin in 1903 to undertake his studies in\nphilosophy, physics and mathematics. In 1908, he successfully\ndefended, under the direction of Stumpf, a doctoral thesis on the work\nof Ernst Mach (R. Musil, 1908; R. Haller, 2003). Another important\naspect of their relationship concerns Stumpf\u2019s influence on\nMusil\u2019s literary work, which gave rise to a vast literature. One\nof the important sources of Musil\u2019s early novels and theoretical\nfragments is the work of Traugott K. Oesterreich (1910) who wrote his\ndoctoral dissertation in 1905 under the supervision of Stumpf. Another\nsource is Stumpf\u2019s theory of emotions, which he presented in his\narticles of 1899 and 1907 (Stumpf, 1928b) and his lectures on\npsychology given during the winter semester of 1906\u20131907 in\nwhich he attaches great importance to the theme of sense feelings and\nemotions. It is more than likely that Musil attended these\nlectures.\n",
