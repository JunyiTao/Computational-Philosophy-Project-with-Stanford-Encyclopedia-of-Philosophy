    "main_text": "Time and Necessity: The Sea-Battle\n12. Time and Necessity: The Sea-Battle\n\nThe passage in Aristotle\u2019s logical works which has received\nperhaps the most intense discussion in recent decades is On\nInterpretation 9, where Aristotle discusses the question whether\nevery proposition about the future must be either true or false.\nThough something of a side issue in its context, the passage raises a\nproblem of great importance to Aristotle\u2019s near contemporaries\n(and perhaps contemporaries).\n\nA contradiction (antiphasis) is a pair of\npropositions one of which asserts what the other denies. A major goal\nof On Interpretation is to discuss the thesis that, of every\nsuch contradiction, one member must be true and the other false. In\nthe course of his discussion, Aristotle allows for some exceptions.\nOne case is what he calls indefinite propositions\nsuch as \u201cA man is walking\u201d: nothing prevents both this\nproposition and \u201cA man is not walking\u201d being\nsimultaneously true. This exception can be explained on relatively\nsimple grounds.\n\nA different exception arises for more complex reasons. Consider these\ntwo propositions:\n\nThere will be a sea-battle tomorrow\nThere will not be a sea-battle tomorrow\n\n\nIt seems that exactly one of these must be true and the other false.\nBut if (1) is now true, then there must be a\nsea-battle tomorrow, and there cannot fail to be a sea-battle\ntomorrow. The result, according to this puzzle, is that nothing is\npossible except what actually happens: there are no unactualized\npossibilities.\n\nSuch a conclusion is, as Aristotle is quick to note, a problem both\nfor his own metaphysical views about potentialities and for the\ncommonsense notion that some things are up to us. He therefore\nproposes another exception to the general thesis concerning\ncontradictory pairs.\n\nThis much would probably be accepted by most interpreters. What the\nrestriction is, however, and just what motivates it are matters of\nwide disagreement. It has been proposed, for instance, that Aristotle\nadopted, or at least flirted with, a three-valued logic for future\npropositions, or that he countenanced truth-value gaps, or that his\nsolution includes still more abstruse reasoning. The literature is\nmuch too complex to summarize: see Anscombe, Hintikka, D. Frede,\nWhitaker, Waterlow.\n\nHistorically, at least, it is likely that Aristotle is responding to\nan argument originating with the Megarian philosophers. He ascribes\nthe view that only that which happens is possible to the Megarians in\nMetaphysics IX (\u0398). The puzzle with which he is\nconcerned strongly recalls the \u201cMaster Argument\u201d of\n Diodorus Cronus\n especially in certain further details. For instance, Aristotle\nimagines the statement about tomorrow\u2019s sea battle having been\nuttered ten thousand years ago. If it was true, then its truth was a\nfact about the past; if the past is now unchangeable, then so is the\ntruth value of that past utterance. This recalls the Master\nArgument\u2019s premise that \u201cwhat is past is necessary\u201d.\nDiodorus Cronus was active a little after Aristotle, and he was\ncertainly influenced by Megarian views, whether or not it is correct\nto call him a Megarian (David Sedley 1977 argues that he was instead a\nmember of the\n Dialectical School\n which was in any event an offshoot of the Megarians; see Dorion 1995\nand D\u00f6ring 1989, Ebert 2008 and the article Dialectical School).\nIt is therefore likely that Aristotle\u2019s target here is some\nMegarian argument, perhaps a forerunner of Diodorus\u2019 Master\nArgument.\n",
