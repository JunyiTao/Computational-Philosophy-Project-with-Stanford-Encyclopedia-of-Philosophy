First, 19th-century\nelectrodynamics raised again the question of a privileged frame of\nreference: the conception of light as an electromagnetic wave in the\nether implied that the rest-frame of the ether itself should play a\ndistinguished role in electrodynamical phenomena. On the one hand,\nphysicists such as Maxwell and Lorentz were careful to point out that\nvelocity relative to the ether was not equivalent to absolute\nvelocity, because the state of motion of the ether itself was\nnecessarily unknown. In other words, this conception of light did not\nnecessarily violate the classical principle of relativity. On the\nother hand, the existence of such a preferred frame made the\nequivalence of inertial frames correspondingly less interesting, even\nif it was true in principle. This is why the appearance of the idea of\ninertial frame in the 1880s, as suggested earlier, was not of pressing\nphysical interest to the majority of physicists, and seemed to be a\nmere philosophical sidelight. The attempts to measure the effects of\nmotion relative to the ether commanded considerably more\nattention.\n\nSecond, the abandonment of the ether\u2014following the failure of\nattempts to measure velocity relative to the ether and, more\ngenerally, the apparent independence of all electrodynamical phenomena\nof motion relative to the ether\u2014did not vindicate the Newtonian\ninertial frame. Rather, it required a dramatically revised conception.\nSpecial relativity might be said to have applied the relativity\nprinciple of Newtonian mechanics to Maxwell\u2019s electrodynamics,\nby eliminating the privileged status of the rest-frame of the ether\nand admitting that the velocity of light is independent of the motion\nof the source. As Einstein expressed it, \u201cthe same laws of\nelectrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference\nfor which the equations of mechanics hold good.\u201d (1905, p. 38.)\nBut as Einstein also pointed out, the invariance of the velocity of\nlight and the principle of relativity, at least in its Galilean form,\nare incompatible. It simply makes no sense, according to Galilean\nrelativity, that any velocity should appear to be the same in inertial\nframes that are in relative motion.\n",
