Thus,\nmodern cosmology is not only about the past of the universe, it also\noffers scenarios about its far future, including speculations about\nthe fate of intelligent life. Given that the apocalyptic passages in\nthe Bible speak of an end of the world and a possible new creation\n(e.g., 2 Peter 3:10\u201313), the cosmic future may seem to offer\nanother point of contact between cosmology and theistic religion. But\ncan there be a secular or scientific eschatology?\n\nScientifically based speculations about the state of the cosmos in the\nfar future and the possibility of endless life were first discussed in\nthe late nineteenth century in connection with the controversy over\nthe heat death predicted by the second law of thermodynamics. Some of\nthe German scientists involved in the controversy argued that life\nmight persist even in the very high-entropic environment of the far\nfuture, and they explicitly referred to the eschatological aspects of\ncosmology. Characteristically, while the heat death scenario was\nwelcomed by Christian authors, it was vehemently opposed by\nmaterialists and atheists who argued for an eternal universe with\neternal life. As Eddington, a Quaker and an advocate of the inevitable\nheat death, later asked: \u201cSince when has the teaching that\n\u2018 heaven and earth shall pass away\u2019 become\necclesiastically un-orthodox?\u201d (Eddington 1935, 59).\n\nSince the 1970s \u201cphysical eschatology\u201d has emerged as a\nnew subfield of astrophysics and cosmology, pioneered by Freeman\nDyson, Jamal Islam and others (see the survey in Kragh 2011,\n325\u2013353). The field deals primarily with the state of the\nuniverse in the remote future as based on extrapolations of\ncosmological models and the assumption that the presently known laws\nof physics will remain indefinitely valid. The favored scenario is the\nopen ever-expanding universe where extrapolations typically result in\nan ultimate future (at about 10100\nyears from now!) in which the universe consists of nothing but an\nexceedingly thin electron-positron plasma immersed in a cold radiation\nof neutrinos and photons. Other studies presume a closed universe\ncollapsing in a big crunch and others again investigate the nearer\nfuture of humankind, say a few million years from now. While many of\nthese studies are not concerned with the final state of life, some\nare, and it is this latter group that constitutes physical eschatology\nproper. According to John Barrow and Frank Tipler, the research field\nis, \u201cthe study of the survival and the behavior of life in the\nfar future\u201d (Barrow & Tipler 1986, 658).\n\nPhysical eschatologists usually ignore the religious associations of\ntheir studies or deny that they exist. Tipler is a controversial\nexception, however. Not only does he argue that some kind of life can\ncontinue forever in a closed universe, he also claims that it is the\nvery collapse of the universe that permits eternal life. When the\nfinal eternity has been reached at what he calls the \u201comega\npoint,\u201d life becomes omniscient and the temporal becomes\natemporal. According to Tipler, the final singularity is God and\n\u201ctheology is nothing but physical cosmology based on the\nassumption that life as a whole is immortal\u201d (Tipler 1995, 17).\nIn his book The Physics of Christianity (Tipler 2007), he\ncontinues his idiosyncratic exploration of modern cosmotheology\naccording to which theology is merely a branch of physics.\nTipler\u2019s views are undoubtedly extreme, but (and perhaps for\nthis reason) they have caused much discussion among theologians.\n\nThe term physical eschatology indicates a connection to biblical\neschatology, but it is far from clear that the two are related in any\nmeaningful sense. The message of the Bible is not so much the end of\nthe physical universe as it is about the imminent return of Christ,\nthe transformation of humans from flesh to spirit, and the final\nkingdom of God. It is about the ultimate destiny and goal of humans,\nnot of self-reproducing robots. As Jefferson Davis (1999) notes, the\nultimate hope which is crucial in theology cannot be supplied\nby the laws of physics. The scenario of a closed universe, such as\nargued by Tipler, may appear to be more compatible with the biblical\nview than the case of the ever-expanding universe, but even in the\nformer case it is hard to establish a meaningful connection. While the\nend of the world does not conflict with the Bible, the claims of\nimmortality of intelligent life forms (not necessarily humans) do. The\nBible says that God alone is immortal and that all his created beings\nare doomed to extinction unless God decides otherwise.\n\nSeveral theologians have expressed concern about the\ncosmologists\u2019 scenarios of the end of the universe and stressed\nthat there is a world of difference between these scenarios and proper\neschatology. According to Wolfhart Pannenberg the Christian\naffirmation of an imminent end of the world is scarcely reconcilable\nwith the cosmological extrapolations of the state of the universe\nzillions of years ahead. Karl Peters probably speaks for the majority\nof theologians when he writes: \u201cIf the expanding universe is\nindeed open, expanding forever, then how can one speak of God\nrecreating the universe? If the universe is closed, then it is likely\nto end in a \u2018big crunch\u2019 of mammoth black-hole\nproportions. Again, it is difficult to see how a new creation can take\nplace\u201d (Schwarz 2000, 180). According to Peters, the physical\nend of the universe would in effect imply the non-existence of God as\nunderstood in the Christian tradition. Whereas Pannenberg, Peters,\nArthur Peacocke and others tend to think that physical and Christian\neschatology are either contradictory or incommensurable, Craig has\ntaken a more reconcilable view. According to him, the\ncosmologists\u2019 versions of secular eschatology furnish grounds\nfor taking seriously the hypothesis of a transcendent creative and\nomnipotent agent. This agent may not be the classical God, but more\nlikely God in a panentheistic version.\n\nFinally, Robert Russell (2008) argues that the potential conflict\nmight be resolved by appealing to God\u2019s omnipotence and freedom\nto perform miracles: the future of the universe would have\nbeen what science predicts had God not decided to act at Easter and\nbring about, and will continue to bring about, the new creation. This\nview is allegedly not in conflict with science, but only with the\nphilosophical assumption that the events predicted by science must\nhappen, and this assumption Russell sees no reason to accept.\n8. Conclusions: Cosmology and God\n\nThe question, \u201cwhy does the universe exist?\u201d admits of\nanswers from traditional religions as well as from contemporary\ncosmological theories. However, according to Bede Rundle (2004),\nneither of these answers are needed, for philosophical analysis is\nsufficient to prove the existence of a physical universe. While some\nclaim that the scientific answer has superseded all theological\nanswers, others claim that the scientific answer reinforces the claim\nthat God created the universe. Indeed, the story of the interaction\nbetween scientific cosmology and theology is by no means a simple tale\nof a better theory replacing an inferior; nor a simple tale of the\nconvergence of diverse sources of knowledge. A naive or ideological\nreading of twentieth century cosmology might count big bang cosmology\nas providing new support for theism, and alternatives such as\nsteady-state cosmology as atheistic backlashes. (And of course, the\nwork of apologists such as W.L. Craig lends credence to this sort of\npicture.) But such a view misses many nuances, both in the historical\nrecord, as well as in the logical structure of these issues. From a\nhistorical point of view, there has been little correlation between\nreligious views of scientific cosmologists and their proposed\ncosmological models. From an epistemological point of view, there are\nnumerous obstacles to claiming that the big bang confirms the\nhypothesis that God exists. And from a metaphysical point of view,\nGod\u2019s hand is not manifest even in big bang models: these models\nhave no first state for God to create, and these models have no time\nfor God to exist in before the big bang.\n\nBy pointing out some of the subtleties in the relationship between\nscientific cosmology and theology, we do not intend to claim that the\ntwo are nonoverlapping magisteria (to borrow a phrase from Stephen Jay\nGould). To the contrary, contemporary cosmology is fascinating\nprecisely because it has such intricate logical relations with\ntraditional metaphysical and theological issues.",
