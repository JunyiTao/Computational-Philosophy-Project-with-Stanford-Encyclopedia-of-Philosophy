    "main_text": "Discovery: From A-ha Moments to Discovery Strategies || Philosophical Work to Be Done\n6.4 Philosophical Work to Be Done\nMany mechanists have explored the strategies that scientists use in\ndiscovery. Bechtel and Richardson attended to decomposition and\nlocalization; Darden and Craver highlighted forward and backward\nchaining; Russo and Williamson emphasized drawing on both\ndifference-making and mechanistic evidence. These strategies were\nfound in specific, experimental sciences, such as neuroscience and\nmolecular biology. So one task for philosophers moving forward is to\nassess whether or not similar strategies exist in other sciences,\nespecially those that operate outside the traditional laboratory, both\nin the human sciences (such as sociology and economics) and in the\nphysical sciences (such as cosmology).\nWe also expect tremendous development to come from bridging the gap\nbetween the qualitative accounts of mechanisms and mechanistic\nexplanation developed in the new mechanism and quantitative theories\nof discovery from the discipline of machine learning and causal\nmodeling (Spirtes et al. 2000; Pearl 2009). The latter offer tools to\nmine correlational data for causal dependencies. Such tools might\nescape more qualitative, historical approaches and might, in fact, go\nbeyond the common strategies that scientists traditionally use. Such\ntools also offer a means to assess discovery strategies by exploring\nthe conditions under which they succeed and fail and the efficiency\nwith which they deliver verdicts on causal hypotheses.\n",
