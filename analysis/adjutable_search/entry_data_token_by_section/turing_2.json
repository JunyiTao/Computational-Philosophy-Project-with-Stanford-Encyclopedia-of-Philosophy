    "main_text": "The Logical and the Physical\n3. The Logical and the Physical\n\n\nAs put by Gandy (1988), Turing's paper was \u2018a paradigm of\nphilosophical analysis,\u2019 refining a vague notion into a precise\ndefinition. But it was more than being an analysis within the\nworld of mathematical logic: in Turing's thought the question that\nconstantly recurs both theoretically and practically is the\nrelationship of the logical Turing machine to the physical world. \n\n\n\u2018Effective\u2019 means doing, not merely imagining\nor postulating. At this stage neither Turing nor any other logician\nmade a serious investigation into the physics of such\n\u2018doing.\u2019 But Turing's image of a teleprinter-like machine\ndoes inescapably refer to something that could actually be physically\n\u2018done.\u2019 His concept is a distillation of the idea that one\ncan only \u2018do\u2019 one simple action, or finite number of simple\nactions, at a time. How \u2018physical\u2019 a concept is it?\n\n\nThe tape never holds more than a finite number of marked squares at\nany point in a computation. Thus it can be thought of as being finite,\nbut always capable of further extension as required. Obviously this\nunbounded extendibility is unphysical, but the definition is still of\npractical use: it means that anything done on a finite tape, however\nlarge, is computable. (Turing himself took such a finitistic approach\nwhen explaining the practical relevance of computability in his 1950\npaper.) One aspect of Turing's formulation, however, involves absolute\nfiniteness: the table of behaviour of a Turing machine must be finite,\nsince Turing allows only a finite number of\n\u2018configurations\u2019 of a Turing machine, and only a finite\nrepertoire of symbols which can be marked on the tape. This is\nessentially equivalent to allowing only computer programs with finite\nlengths of code.\n\n\n\u2018Calculable by finite means\u2019 was Turing's\ncharacterisation of computability, which he justified with the argument\nthat \u2018the human memory is necessarily limited.\u2019 (Turing\n1936, p. 231). The whole point of his definition lies in encoding\ninfinite potential effects, (e.g. the printing of an infinite decimal)\ninto finite \u2018tables of behaviour\u2019. There would be no point\nin allowing machines with infinite \u2018tables of behaviour\u2019.\nIt is obvious, for instance, that any real number could be printed by\nsuch a \u2018machine\u2019, by letting the Nth configuration be\n\u2018programmed\u2019 to print the Nth digit, for example. Such a\n\u2018machine\u2019 could likewise store any countable number of\nstatements about all possible mathematical expressions, and so make the\nEntscheidungsproblem trivial.\n\n\nChurch (1937), when reviewing Turing's paper while Turing was in\nPrinceton under his supervision, actually gave a bolder\ncharacterisation of the Turing machine as an arbitrary finite\nmachine.\nThe author [i.e. Turing] proposes as a criterion that an\ninfinite sequence of digits 0 and 1 be \u201ccomputable\u201d that it shall be\npossible to devise a computing machine, occupying a finite space and\nwith working parts of finite size, which will write down the sequence\nto any desired number of terms if allowed to run for a sufficiently\nlong time. As a matter of convenience, certain further restrictions are\nimposed on the character of the machine, but these are of such a nature\nas obviously to cause no loss of generality\u2014in particular, a\nhuman calculator, provided with pencil and paper and explicit\ninstructions, can be regarded as a kind of Turing machine.\n\n\nChurch (1940) repeated this characterisation. Turing neither\nendorsed it nor said anything to contradict it, leaving the general\nconcept of \u2018machine\u2019 itself undefined. The work of Gandy\n(1980) did more to justify this characterisation, by refining the\nstatement of what is meant by \u2018a machine.\u2019 His results\nsupport Church's statement; they also argue strongly for the view that\nnatural attempts to extend the notion of computability lead to\ntrivialisation: if Gandy's conditions on a \u2018machine\u2019 are\nsignificantly weakened then every real number becomes calculable (Gandy\n1980, p. 130ff.). (For a different interpretation of Church's\nstatement, see the article on the\n Church-Turing Thesis.)\n\n\nTuring did not explicitly discuss the question of the speed\nof his elementary actions. It is left implicit in his discussion, by\nhis use of the word \u2018never,\u2019 that it is not possible for\ninfinitely many steps to be performed in a finite time. Others have\nexplored the effect of abandoning this restriction. Davies (2001), for\ninstance, describes a \u2018machine\u2019 with an infinite number of\nparts, requiring components of arbitrarily small size, running at\narbitrarily high speeds. Such a \u2018machine\u2019 could perform\nuncomputable tasks. Davies emphasises that such a machine cannot be\nbuilt in our own physical world, but argues that it could be\nconstructed in a universe with different physics. To the extent that it\nrules out such \u2018machines\u2019, the Church-Turing thesis must\nhave at least some physical content.\n\n\nTrue physics is quantum-mechanical, and this implies a different\nidea of matter and action from Turing's purely classical picture. It is\nperhaps odd that Turing did not point this out in this period, since he\nwas well versed in quantum physics. Instead, the analysis and practical\ndevelopment of quantum computing was left to the 1980s. Quantum\ncomputation, using the evolution of wave-functions rather than\nclassical machine states, is the most important way in which Turing\nmachine model has been challenged. The standard formulation of quantum\ncomputing (Deutsch 1985, following Feynman 1982) does not predict\nanything beyond computable effects, although within the realm of the\ncomputable, quantum computations may be very much more efficient than\nclassical computations. It is possible that a deeper understanding of\nquantum mechanical physics may further change the picture of what can\nbe physically \u2018done.\u2019\n",
