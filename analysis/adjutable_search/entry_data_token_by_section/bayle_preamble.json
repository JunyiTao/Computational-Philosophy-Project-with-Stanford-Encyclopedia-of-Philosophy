    "main_text": "\n\nPierre Bayle (1647\u20131706), the \u201cPhilosopher of\nRotterdam\u201d, was a historian, literary critic, journalist,\nencyclopedist, French Protestant refugee, professor, and above all,\nphilosopher. Although he is usually grouped today among the\n\u201cminor figures\u201d in the history of philosophy, Bayle was\nconsidered by the leading philosophers of his day as an equal, as one\nof the most erudite authors of his or any century. Upon Bayle\u2019s\ndeath, G.W. Leibniz wrote: \u201che has departed from us, and such a\nloss is no small one, a writer whose learning and acumen few have\nequalled\u201d (1710 [1952]: 68). The Preface to the\nTheodicy makes clear that it was Bayle who motivated Leibniz\nto write the only book he ever saw fit to publish. While Leibniz\nsought mainly to refute Bayle in that work, the next century of\nEnlightenment philosophes found inspiration in Bayle\u2019s\nvast oeuvre. Bayle\u2019s six-million word Historical and\nCritical Dictionary (1697; 1702) was so often cited in the\neighteenth century that Ernst Cassirer has called it the\n\u201cArsenal of the Enlightenment\u201d. Inventories of private\nEuropean libraries have established the Dictionary as one of\nthe bestsellers of its age. David Hume was clearly influenced by it;\nhe told his friend Michael Ramsay in a letter of 1737 that if he\nwished to understand his writings he should read Descartes,\nMalebranche, Berkeley, and \u201csome of the more metaphysical\nArticles of Bailes Dictionary; such as [those of] Zeno and\nSpinoza\u201d (Hume 2007: 203\u2013204).\n\nBayle made numerous positive contributions to the history of\nphilosophy, such as arguments for the possibility of a virtuous\natheist; for the possibility of a society of atheists that is morally\nsuperior to a society of Christians; for religious toleration; and for\nthe widest possible freedom of conscience. But Bayle is usually\nremembered for the destructive force of his reasoning. In the sixth\nchapter of his Holy Family (1845), Karl Marx claimed that\nBayle\n\n\nwas driven by religious doubt to doubt about metaphysics which was the\nsupport of that faith. He therefore critically investigated\nmetaphysics from its very origin. He became its historian in order to\nwrite the history of its death. He mainly refuted Spinoza and\nLeibniz (1845 [1956]: 171).\n\n\nRichard Popkin found in Bayle\u2019s writings the culmination of the\nskeptical crisis in early modernity, calling Bayle a\n\u201csuperskeptic\u201d (2003: 283) and crediting him with\nundermining the leading philosophical systems of his day. And Jonathan\nIsrael gives partial credit for the origin of the Radical\nEnlightenment to Bayle\u2019s critiques of tradition, superstitious,\nreligion, and authority.\n\nHowever, not all of Bayle\u2019s readers would agree with these\nradical interpretations. The twentieth century\u2019s most\ninfluential Bayle scholar, Elisabeth Labrousse, read as deeply into\nBayle\u2019s writings as anyone, and found therein the signs of a\nsincere, and at times traditional, Calvinist Christian. Other\ncontemporary Bayle scholars, notably Jean-Luc Sol\u00e8re, have\ntraced the core of some of Bayle\u2019s most \u201cmodern\u201d\ndoctrines, such as his universal freedom of conscience and religious\ntoleration, back to traditional Medieval philosophical notions of\nconscience and its rights. Contradictory interpretations of\nBayle\u2019s writings flourished in his day and have continued to\nappear in every century since his death, leaving historians of\nphilosophy with the problem of the \u201cBayle enigma\u201d.\n",
