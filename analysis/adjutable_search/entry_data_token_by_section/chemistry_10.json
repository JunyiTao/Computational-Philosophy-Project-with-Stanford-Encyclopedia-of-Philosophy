    "main_text": "The Chemical Revolution || Caloric\n3.1 Caloric\n\nIn 1761, Joseph Black discovered that heating a body doesn\u2019t always\nraise its temperature. In particular, he noticed that heating ice at\n0\u00b0C converts it to liquid at the same temperature. Similarly,\nthere is a latent heat of vaporization which must be supplied for the\nconversion of liquid water into steam at the boiling point without\nraising the temperature. It was some time before the modern\ninterpretation of Black\u2019s ground-breaking discovery was fully\ndeveloped. He had shown that heat must be distinguished from the state\nof warmth of a body and even from the changes in that state. But it\nwasn\u2019t until the development of thermodynamics that heating was\ndistinguished as a process from the property or quality of being warm\nwithout reference to a transferred substance.\n\nBlack himself was apparently wary of engaging in hypothetical\nexplanations of heat phenomena (Fox 1971), but he does suggest an\ninterpretation of the latent heat of fusion of water as a chemical\nreaction involving the combination of the heat fluid with ice to yield\nthe new substance water. Lavoisier incorporated Black\u2019s conception of\nlatent heat into his caloric theory of heat, understanding latent heat\ntransferred to a body without raising its temperature as caloric fluid\nbound in chemical combination with that body and not contributing to\nthe body\u2019s degree of warmth or temperature. Lavoisier\u2019s theory thus\nretains something of Aristotle\u2019s, understanding what we would call a\nphase change of the same substance as a transformation of one\nsubstance into another.\n\nCaloric figures in Lavoisier\u2019s list of elements as the \u201celement\nof heat or fire\u201d (Lavoisier 1789, p. 175), \u201cbecom[ing]\nfixed in bodies \u2026 [and] act[ing] upon them with a repulsive\nforce, from which, or from its accumulation in bodies to a greater or\nlesser degree, the transformation of solids into fluids, and of fluids\nto aeriform elasticity, is entirely owing\u201d (1789, p. 183). He\ngoes on to define \u2018gas\u2019 as \u201cthis aeriform state of\nbodies produced by a sufficient accumulation of caloric.\u201d Under\nthe list of binary compounds formed with hydrogen, caloric is said to\nyield hydrogen gas (1789, p. 198). Similarly, under the list of binary\ncompounds formed with phosphorus, caloric yields phosphorus gas (1789,\np. 204). The Lavoisian element base of oxygen combines with the\nLavoisian element caloric to form the compound oxygen gas. The\ncompound of base of oxygen with a smaller amount of caloric is oxygen\nliquid (known only in principle to Lavoisier). What we would call the\nphase change of liquid to gaseous oxygen is thus for him a change of\nsubstance. Light also figures in his list of elements, and is said\n\u201cto have a great affinity with oxygen, \u2026 and contributes\nalong with caloric to change it into the state of gas\u201d (1789, p.\n185).\n",
