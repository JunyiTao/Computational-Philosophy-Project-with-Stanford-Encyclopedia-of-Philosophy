    "main_text": "The Epistemic View of Games || Stages of Decision Making\n1.3 Stages of Decision Making\nIt is standard in the game theory literature to distinguish three\nstages of the decision making process: ex ante, ex\ninterim and ex post. At one extreme is the ex\nante stage where no decision has been made yet. The other extreme\nis the ex post stage where the choices of all players are\nopenly disclosed. In between these two extremes is the ex\ninterim stage where the players have made their decisions, but\nthey are still uninformed about the decisions and intentions of the\nother players.\nThese distinctions are not intended to be sharp. Rather, they\ndescribe various stages of information disclosure during the\ndecision-making process. At the ex-ante stage, little is\nknown except the structure of the game, who is taking part, and\npossibly (but not necessarily) some aspect of the agents\u2019\ncharacter. At the ex-post stage the game is basically over:\nall player have made their decision and these are now irrevocably out\nin the open. This does not mean that all uncertainty is removed as an\nagent may remain uncertain about what exactly the others were\nexpecting of her. In between these two extreme stages lies a whole\ngradation of states of information disclosure that we loosely refer to\nas \u201cthe\u201d ex-interim stage. Common to these stages\nis the fact that the agents have made a decision, although\nnot necessarily an irrevocable one.\nIn this entry, we focus on the ex interim stage of\ndecision making. This is in line with much of the literature on the\nepistemic foundations of game theory as it allows for a\nstraightforward assessment of the agents\u2019 rationality given\ntheir expectations about how their opponents will choose. Focusing on\nthe ex interim stage does raise some interesting questions\nabout possible correlations between a player\u2019s strategy\nchoice, what Stalnaker (1999) calls \u201cactive knowledge\u201d,\nand her information about the choices of others, her \u201cpassive\nknowledge\u201d (idem). The question of how a player should\nreact, that is eventually revise her decision, upon learning that she\ndid not choose \u201crationally\u201d is an interesting and\nimportant one, but we do not discuss it in the entry. Note that this\nquestion is different from the one of how agents should revise their\nbeliefs upon learning that others did not choose\nrationally. This second question is very relevant in games in which\nplayers choose sequentially, and will be addressed\nin Section 4.2.3.\n",
