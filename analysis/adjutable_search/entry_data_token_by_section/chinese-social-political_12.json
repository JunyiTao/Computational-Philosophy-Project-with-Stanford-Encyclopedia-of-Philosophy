    "main_text": "The Neo-Confucian Era\n4. The Neo-Confucian Era\n\nThe Neo-Confucian era begins in the early Song dynasty, which itself\nis founded in 960 CE. A combination of social and political changes\ncreate fertile ground for new socio-political theorizing. The key\nmarker of social status in the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) had been\none\u2019s pedigree, and the society was organized around something\nclose to a state-sponsored aristocracy. Seeking its own legitimacy,\nthe leaders of the new Song dynasty settled on a partnership with a\ntransformed elite class, now based more in education and claims of\nmerit than in ancestry. Instead of official families, the elite become\na \u201ccommunity of the educated\u201d; Song society is far more\nliterate and published than its Tang predecessor, and scholars\ngenerally refer to the new elite as the \u201cliterati\u201d (Bol\n2008: 31\u20139). In this fertile soil, the idea that literati should\nreflect on the Way and seek to influence their society took root and\ngrew.\n\nIn the mid-twentieth century, a range of scholars argued for two,\nclosely linked theses concerning the relation of Neo-Confucians to\nimperial power. The first was the Autocracy Thesis, according to which\nimperial power began to grow in the Song dynasty, eventually reaching\ndespotic levels in later dynasties. The second was the Inward-Turn\nThesis, which held that Neo-Confucians largely abdicated from\nengagement in political affairs, especially after the loss of northern\nChina (Liu 1988). In recent decades, though, new scholarship has shown\nquite convincingly that ministerial and literati power remain\nsignificant throughout the Song, and that Neo-Confucians remain\npolitically engaged (Bol 2008: 119; Levey 1991: 545f). The nature of\nthe political engagement does change, however. Rather than seeing\nNeo-Confucians as simply advocating an inward turn, it is more\naccurate to see them as often favoring a localist, decentralized\napproach to governance. Among other things, they come to see non-state\nspaces as extremely important to successful change at wider levels of\nthe state. This is not to say that Neo-Confucians abandon efforts to\neducate, direct, and serve the emperor, and strong emperors early in\nthe Ming and Qing dynasties manage to bring the focus back to\nthemselves for periods of time. Overall, though, the emphasis of\nNeo-Confucian theories of governance is nicely captured in the modern\nslogan \u201cthink globally, act locally\u201d.\n\nAccording to Neo-Confucians, institutions of governance operate on two\nlevels simultaneously, one socio-political and the other personal. At\nthe socio-political level, they are concerned with the practicalities\nof keeping order in a large state filled with imperfect people. At the\npersonal level they are concerned with an individual\u2019s moral\ncharacter. Someone might think that operations on these two levels\nwork at cross-purposes, because crafting good institutions and\npolicies requires that we take human imperfections into account, and\nyet a full commitment to improving one\u2019s character requires that\nwe rise above these imperfections. Neo-Confucians disagree. For them,\nthe continuity of the socio-political with the personal received its\ncanonical expression in a passage from the classical Greater\nLearning:\n\n\nWanting to light up the bright virtue of all in the world, the\nancients first put their states in order. Those who wanted to put\ntheir states in order first regulated their families. Those who wanted\nto regulate their families first cultivated their selves. Those who\nwanted to cultivate their selves first rectified their heartminds.\nThose who wanted to rectify their heartminds first made their\nintentions sincere. Those who wanted to make their intentions sincere\nfirst reached understanding. Reaching understanding lies in\ninvestigating things. (Greater Learning 4)\n\n\nWe could understand the continuity described in this passage as a\ntemporally connected set of steps: first investigate things, then\nreach understanding, then make one\u2019s intentions sincere, and so\non, eventually putting one\u2019s state in order. But in fact the\nNeo-Confucians tend to see the steps as mutually constitutive:\ninvestigating things just is reaching understanding, families are\nregulated through the very act of personal cultivation, and having\norderly families is part of what it means for a state to be in order.\nThe implicit relationship between personal cultivation and\nsocio-political order is captured in the frequently used slogan\n\u201cinner sage-outer king\u201d: ethics and governance are two\nsides of the same coin. In other words, socio-political order entails\nthe ethical transformation of people in the state, as well as their\nleaders; in the language of the text, this is to \u201clight up the\nbright virtue of all in the world\u201d.\n\nWith virtually no exceptions, Neo-Confucians accepted hereditary\nmonarchy as their form of government. This does not mean that all\nmonarchs automatically enjoyed full legitimacy, however. Already in\nthe latter half of the Tang dynasty, Confucian and Buddhist scholars\nhad begun to claim that the proper moral or spiritual teaching was\npassed on in a genealogical fashion (Wilson 1995). Han Yu\n(768\u2013824) famously asserted that this transmission of the\nConfucian \u201cWay\u201d had been lost for many centuries; Northern\nSong progenitors of Neo-Confucianism argued that it was only in their\ngeneration that the Way had been recovered. In other words, legitimate\nsuccession from one monarch to another did not assure that individual\nrulers\u2014or even their dynasty as a whole\u2014were following the\nWay. Zhu Xi (1130\u20131200) gives this idea its most influential\nformulation when he says that the \u201csuccession of the Way\n(daotong)\u201d comes to those who are able to grasp the\ndeep truths embedded in the classics by the early sages. According to\nthis view, the earliest sages both grasped the Way and ruled, but over\ntime rulers lost this tie to the moral Way. A few great teachers like\nConfucius and Mencius understood the Way and tried to steer their\nsocieties in the right direction, even though they were not rulers,\nbut eventually the succession of the Way was lost until it was\nrecovered, says Zhu Xi, by the Cheng brothers (Cheng Hao\n[1032\u20131085] and Cheng Yi [1033\u20131107]).\n\nThe idea that the succession of the Way can come apart from the more\nsuperficial succession of monarchy has a number of important\nimplications, especially when combined with the view of governance\noperating at two levels (maintaining social order and achieving moral\ntransformation). Borrowing a term from classical antiquity,\nNeo-Confucians argue that a ruler who is successful at keeping order\nbut who falls short of achieving broader transformation is a mere\n\u201chegemon\u201d rather than a true \u201cking\u201d. It is\nbetter to be a hegemon than a cruel tyrant, to be sure, but even the\nsuccessful hegemon still needs to aspire to something greater. The\ngatekeepers to these greater achievements, meanwhile, are those\nscholars who have attained the succession of the Way. According to\nthis manner of thinking, therefore, monarchs must accept that leaders\nof the literati should be their teachers or even co-rulers, or that\nthe monarch\u2019s central authority should be reined in so that\nmorally cultivated literati can hold sway over local affairs. Over the\nNeo-Confucian period literati had varying degrees of success in\nasserting authority derived from the succession of the Way.\n",
