    "main_text": "\n\nThe epistemic basing relation is the relation which holds between a\nreason and a belief if and only if the reason is a reason for which\nthe belief is held. It is generally thought to be a necessary, but not\nsufficient, condition for a belief\u2019s being justified that the\nbelief be based on a reason. The basing relation is what distinguishes\ngood reasons which a person possesses that contribute to the personal\njustification of a given belief from good reasons which the person\npossesses but that do not contribute to the personal justification of\nthe belief.\n\nBasing relations may be involved in both inferential and\nnon-inferential justification. For example, one may hold that sensory\nstates count as reasons, and thus require that a sensory belief be\nbased on a reason if it is to be justified by that reason. In\naddition, one might understand at least some self-evident beliefs to\nbe based on the meanings of the various terms of the sentence\nexpressing the proposition believed. For example, one\u2019s belief\nthat all bachelors are unmarried men may be understood to be based on\nthe meanings of \u2018all\u2019, \u2018bachelors\u2019,\n\u2018are\u2019, etc.\n\nThe basing relation is most frequently analyzed in terms of a\nreason\u2019s causing a\n belief.[1]\n In such analyses, the reason and the belief are understood to be\nmental states of a person. The cause may be a contributing cause or a\nsufficient cause. However, the basing relation has also been analyzed\nas an appropriate counterfactual cause of a belief and also as\ndepending on an appropriate meta-belief to the effect that a reason is\na good reason to hold the belief.\n\nAnalysis of the basing relation is relevant to a variety of\nfundamental epistemological issues. It is relevant to the nature of\nepistemic rationalization and to questions regarding the\ninternalism/externalism debate. In addition, it has been argued that\nreliabilist theories of justification are incompatible with the\ncorrect analysis of the basing relation.\n",
