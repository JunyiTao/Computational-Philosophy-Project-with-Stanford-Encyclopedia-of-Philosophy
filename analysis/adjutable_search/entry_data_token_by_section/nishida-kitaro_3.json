    "main_text": "Theory of Universals and the Logic of Place\n3. Theory of Universals and the Logic of Place\n\n\nNishida\u2019s epistemological motivation gradually gave way to an\nexamination of common ontological assumptions that underlie\nepistemology in the Western philosophical tradition. Not content\nmerely to expose such assumptions, however, Nishida formulated a novel\nontology of experience and self-awareness that would give them logical\nnecessity.\n\n\nConsidering what is taken as the ordinary consciousness of objects,\nNishida\u2019s analysis questions both the notion of consciousness and that\nof objects. We can explicate Nishida\u2019s first concern, with the\nontology of consciousness, in the following way: If the basic form of\nconsciousness did not have the reflexivity of self-awareness, then the\n\u201cconsciousness\u201d of objects would be blind, as it were,\nlike a mechanical or neurological reaction to stimuli with no\nawareness whatsoever, and no way to account for awareness. The problem\nappears in attempts to define consciousness in a non-circular way. A\ndefinition of consciousness as a state of awareness or\nsentience, for example, or a state in which there is\nsomething it feels like to be in that state, merely replaces\nconsciousness with its synonyms. In a sense, awareness is\nirreducible, but it has a logical structure that accounts for its\nconnection to a world of objects. Structurally, awareness mirrors\nitself in itself, in a manner analogous to the way an infinite set\nmirrors itself in its equivalent subsets, or to the way an ideal map\nmirrors itself in all accurate representations of that\n map.[2] \n (Note that the English awareness can be used without the\nword self, but the Japanese word that translates as\nself-awareness is an inseparable compound, ji-kaku.)\nIf such self-awareness is to have logical necessity, it cannot be\nexplained as a contingent property of a particular mind or\nconsciousness that sometimes reflects on itself, that is, as a second\norder consciousness of being conscious of something.\n\n\nSimilarly, if self-awareness is to be an awareness of more than merely\noneself, it cannot be interior to the self alone. Modern\nepistemology\u2019s solution was to split the world (the totality of all there is) in two, mind and\nnature, and then to see the mind as a mirror of nature, and ideas as\nrepresentations of real objects.  Nishida\u2019s solution was to see the\nworld as mirroring itself in all the things \u201cin the\nworld.\u201d Whatever is \u201cin the world\u201d is a mirroring of\nthe world. In this sense it is the world that is\n\u201cself-aware\u201d or self-reflexive; and there is no outside to\nit. An individual\u2019s \u201cself-awareness\u201d is a partial\nmirroring of the world; Nishida later described the individual self as\na focal point of the world. While he was still thinking in terms of\nconsciousness, however, Nishida avoided pinpointing awareness and\nspoke of the world as a field of consciousness to indicate the\nextension of the term beyond the individual self. This field is\nsimilar to Kant\u2019s Bewu\u00dftsein \u00fcberhaupt, in that it\nfunctions as the condition for the possibility of particular acts of\nconsciousness, but unlike Kant\u2019s notion that turns everything into an\nobject of consciousness, its reflexive structure allows it to take\nitself into account without making it another object.\n\n\nWe may use Nishida\u2019s own terms to explain his second concern, the way\nthat objects ordinarily function in judgments.  In what Nishida\nalternatively called the logic of objects or subjective logic, objects\nof consciousness are made the grammatical subject of propositions or judgments,\nand are specified by predicating properties of the \nsubject. Eventually a subject is reached that cannot itself be\npredicated of anything else, recalling Aristotle\u2019s\nhypokeimenon or individual substance that can be subject but\nnever predicate. Even when modern epistemology eschewed or at least\nmodified Aristotle\u2019s notion of substance as a substrate for contingent\nproperties, it appealed to substrates in the sense that they define\nthe primary subject of a judgment, that is, the judgment\u2019s topic and grammatical subject.  Similar to phenomenologists,\nNishida wanted to account for the consciousness that posits such\nsubstances and underlies the subject of a judgment. Essays in From\nThat Which Acts to That Which Sees (1927) and subsequent works\ninvert Aristotle\u2019s notion of the hypokeimenon and propose that\nconsciousness is the \u201ctranscendental predicate\u201d that can\nnever be a subject; in other words consciousness in act can never be\nmade an object of consciousness that could become a grammatical subject.  Nishida is aware of the paradox of\nsuch formulations that would make consciousness the subject of\nsentences that describe it, and he sometimes resorts to explicitly\nparadoxical descriptions such as \u201cseeing without a seer\u201d\nand \u201cseeing the form of the formless, hearing the voice of the\nvoiceless.\u201d But he again also uses the straightforward metaphor,\nthe \u201cfield of consciousness,\u201d to indicate its\nnon-subjective and non-objectifiable character. Consciousness cannot\nbe grasped as the property of an individual substance nor as anything\nlike a substance or underlying substrate itself. It functions as the\nfield that is the opening of world and self.\n\n\nIf judgments describe things and states of affairs and thus would give\nus access to reality by setting themselves over against that reality,\nwe must step back, as it were, and consider a wider reality that\nincludes judgments. In other words, we must place judgments that\npredicate universals of things into a wider field of predication, that is, in the\n\u201ctranscendental predicate\u201d of consciousness. Here Nishida\nmight have further developed a phenomenology of the agency of\npredication, but instead he moves to a more logical account of its\nscope and developed what he called a predicate logic.[3] He thinks of\nuniversals as fields of possibility that become specified or\ndetermined (more accurately, that determine themselves) in their\nparticular instantiations. There is a necessary hierarchy of\nconcreteness among universals that Nishida expresses as the order of\ntopoi or places (basho). Most abstract are the universals\nthat serve as predicates in particular judgments. Judging or\npredication in turn takes place in the topos of consciousness, which\nis further concretized as the universal or topos of reflexive\nself-awareness wherein acts of seeing, knowing, desiring and willing\ntake place. And just as the world of self-awareness enfolds the world\nof nature described in judgments, it in turn is enfolded in the topos\n(Nishida calls it \u201cthe intelligible world\u201d) within which\nthe creative self pursues ideal values like truth, beauty and\ngoodness. Here Nishida echoes the medieval, seemingly all-inclusive\ntranscendentalia that transcend all categories. In his terms,\nall predication would be a mirroring of the transcendentals of being\nand of the one (unum), the true (verum), and the\ngood (bonum). But those transcendentals, insofar as they\nthemselves all elude predication, actually point to a more inclusive\nand undifferentiated topos, absolute nothingness.\n\n\nIn summary, Nishida initially formulated his logic of place or topos\nto counter Neo-Kantian epistemology that took knowledge to be the\nsubject\u2019s form-ruled construction of an objective world. He sought not\nonly to undermine the distinctions between subjective and objective\nbut also to place both sides within a more comprehensive and concrete\nconception. That is, while he first construed knowledge on the model\nof self-awareness in which self reflects itself within itself, he also\nfelt compelled to find a locus of non-differentiation behind the\ndistinction between such awareness and things seen from its vantage\npoint. As non-differentiated and inclusive, that locus is field-like,\na metaphor that Nishida at first replaced with the notion of topos or\n\u201cplace\u201d (basho). Then he placed the topos of\nself-awareness in the even more inclusive and concrete value-forming\nworld. That world of creative activity anticipates what Nishida\neventually considered the ultimate topos that defies description,\npredication, or determination by something beyond or different from\nit.  His logic of place offered an alternative to the logic of\nsubstances presupposed in much traditional metaphysics.\n\n\nThe logical schema of topoi is paralleled by an ontological account.\nNishida articulated the topoi also in terms of what we may call a\nme-ontology, from the Greek meon or non-being. The\ntopos of being describes the world of nature. The topos\nof relative nothingness comprises the field of consciousness that is\nno-thing with respect to the things of which it is conscious. This\nnothingness, however, is still opposed to being, and so differs from\nthe absolute nothingness that underlies both sides of the opposition. Here\nand elsewhere Nishida plays on the word for absolute in Japanese,\nzettai, which literally means breaking through or overcoming\nopposition. His premise is that the meaning of \u201cto be\u201d is\n\u201cto be within\u201d; the ultimate \u201cwithin\u201d is the topos of absolute\nnothingness.\n",
