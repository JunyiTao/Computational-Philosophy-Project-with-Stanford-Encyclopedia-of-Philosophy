However, this is not at all clear (recall the more\ncautious use of terminology advocated by Gottwald).\n\nIn the 1970\u2019s Roman Suszko (1977: 377) declared many-valued\nlogic to be \u201ca magnificent conceptual deceit\u201d. Suszko\nactually claimed that \u201cthere are but two logical values, true\nand false\u201d (Caleiro et al. 2005: 169), a statement now\ncalled Suszko\u2019s Thesis. For Suszko, the set of truth\nvalues assumed in a logical matrix for a many-valued logic is a set of\n\u201cadmissible referents\u201d (called \u201calgebraic\nvalues\u201d) of formulas but not a set of logical values. Whereas\nthe algebraic values are elements of an algebraic structure and\nreferents of formulas, the logical value true is used to\ndefine valid consequence: If every premise is true, then so is (at\nleast one of) the conclusion(s). The other logical value,\nfalse, is preserved in the opposite direction: If the (every)\nconclusion is false, then so is at least one of the premises. The\nlogical values are thus represented by a bi-partition of the set of\nalgebraic values into a set of designated values (truth) and its\ncomplement (falsity).\n\nEssentially the same idea has been taken up earlier by Dummett (1959)\nin an influential paper, where he asks \n\n\nwhat point there may be in distinguishing between different ways in\nwhich a statement may be true or between different ways in which it\nmay be false, or, as we might say, between degrees of truth and\nfalsity. (Dummett 1959: 153) \n\n\nDummett observes that, first, \n\n\nthe sense of a sentence is determined wholly by knowing the case in\nwhich it has a designated value and the cases in which it has an\nundesignated one, \n\n\nand moreover, \n\n\nfiner distinctions between different designated values or different\nundesignated ones, however naturally they come to us, are justified\nonly if they are needed in order to give a truth-functional account of\nthe formation of complex statements by means of operators. (Dummett\n1959: 155) \n\n\nSuszko\u2019s claim evidently echoes this observation by Dummett.\n\nSuszko\u2019s Thesis is substantiated by a rigorous proof (the Suszko\nReduction) showing that every structural Tarskian consequence relation\nand therefore also every structural Tarskian many-valued propositional\nlogic is characterized by a bivalent semantics. (Note also that\nRichard Routley (1975) has shown that every logic based on a\n\u03bb-categorical language has a sound and complete bivalent\npossible worlds semantics.) The dichotomy between designated values\nand values which are not designated and its use in the definition of\nentailment plays a crucial role in the Suszko Reduction. Nevertheless,\nwhile it seems quite natural to construe the set of designated values\nas a generalization of the classical truth value \\(T\\) in some of its\nsignificant roles, it would not always be adequate to interpret the\nset of non-designated values as a generalization of the classical\ntruth value \\(F\\). The point is that in a many-valued logic, unlike in\nclassical logic, \u201cnot true\u201d does not always mean\n\u201cfalse\u201d (cf., e.g., the above interpretation of\nKleene\u2019s logic, where sentences can be neither true nor\nfalse).\n\nIn the literature on many-valued logic it is sometimes proposed to\nconsider a set of antidesignated values which not\nobligatorily constitute the complement of the set of designated values\n(see, e.g., Rescher 1969, Gottwald 2001). The set of antidesignated\nvalues can be regarded as representing a generalized concept of\nfalsity. This distinction leaves room for values that are\nneither designated nor antidesignated and even for\nvalues that are both designated and\nantidesignated.\n\nGrzegorz Malinowski (1990, 1994) takes advantage of this proposal to\ngive a counterexample to Suszko\u2019s Thesis. He defines the notion\nof a single-conclusion quasi-consequence \\((q\\)-consequence)\nrelation. The semantic counterpart of \\(q\\)-consequence is called\n\\(q\\)-entailment. Single-conclusion \\(q\\)-entailment is defined by\nrequiring that if no premise is antidesignated, the conclusion is\ndesignated. Malinowski (1990) proved that for every structural\n\\(q\\)-consequence relation, there exists a characterizing class of\n\\(q\\)-matrices, matrices which in addition to a subset\n\\(\\mathcal{D}^{+}\\) of designated values comprise a disjoint subset\n\\(\\mathcal{D}^-\\) of antidesignated values. Not every\n\\(q\\)-consequence relation has a bivalent semantics.\n\nIn the supplementary document\n Suszko\u2019s Thesis,\n Suszko\u2019s reduction is introduced, Malinowski\u2019s\ncounterexample to Suszko\u2019s Thesis is outlined, and a short\nanalysis of these results is presented.\n\nCan one provide evidence for a multiplicity of logical values? More\nconcretely, \\(is\\) there more than one logical value, each of which\nmay be taken to determine its own (independent) entailment relation? A\npositive answer to this question emerges from considerations on truth\nvalues as structured entities which, by virtue of their internal\nstructure, give rise to natural partial orderings on the set of\nvalues.\n",
