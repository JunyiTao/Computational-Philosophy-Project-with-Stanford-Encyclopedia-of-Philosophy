    "main_text": "Replacement || Dynamical Systems Approaches to Cognition\n4.2 Dynamical Systems Approaches to Cognition\n\n\nAround the turn of the century, some cognitive scientists (Beer 2000;\n2003; Kelso 1995; Thelen and Smith 1993; Thelen et al. 2001) and\nphilosophers (Van Gelder 1995; 1998) began to advocate for dynamical\nsystems approaches cognition. Van Gelder (1995; 1998) argued that the\ncomputer, as the defining metaphor for cognitive systems, should be\nreplaced with something more like the Watt\u2019s centrifugal\ngovernor. A centrifugal governor regulates the speed of a steam engine\nby modulating the opening of a steam valve. As the valve opens, a\nspindle to which flyballs are connected spins faster, causing the\nflyballs to rise, which then cause the steam valve to close,\ndecreasing the speed at which the spindle spins, causing the flyballs\nto drop, thus opening the steam valve, and so on. Whereas a\ncomputational solution to maintaining engine speed might represent the\nengine\u2019s current speed, compare it to a representation of the\nengine\u2019s desired speed, and then calculate and correct for the\ndifference, the centrifugal governor does its job without having to\nrepresent or calculate anything (although some have argued that\nrepresentations are indeed present in the governor: Bechtel 1998;\nPrinz and Barsalou 2000).\n\n\nThe centrifugal governor is an example of a dynamical system. Typical\nof dynamical systems is behavior that changes continuously through\ntime\u2014the height of the flyballs, the speed of the spindle, and\nthe size of the steam valve opening all change continuously through\ntime, and the rate of change in each effects the rate of change of the\nothers. Dynamical systems theory provides the mathematical\napparatus\u2014differential and difference equations\u2014to model\ndynamical systems. It is to these equations that dynamical\ncognitive science looks for explanations of cognition.\n\n\nAmong the most-cited examples of a dynamical explanation of cognition\nis the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) model of coordination dynamics (Haken,\nKelso, and Bunz 1985; Kelso 1995). This model, consisting of a single\ndifferential equation, captures the dynamics of coordinated finger\nwagging. Subjects are asked to wag their right and left index fingers\neither in-phase, where each finger moves toward and away from each\nother, or out-of-phase, like windshield wipers. As the rate of finger\nwagging increases, out-of-phase motion will \u201cflip\u201d to\nin-phase motion, but motion that starts in-phase will remain\nin-phase. In dynamical terms, the coordination of finger wagging has\ntwo attractors, or regions of stability, at slower speeds\n(in-phase and out-of-phase) but only one attractor at a higher speed\n(in-phase). The HKB model makes a number of predictions borne out by\nobservation, for instance that there are only two stable wagging\npatterns at lower speeds, that erratic fluctuations in coordination\nwill occur near the critical threshold at which out-of-phase wagging\ntransforms to in-phase, and that deviations from out-of-phase wagging\nwill take longer to correct near the speed of transformation to\nin-phase (see Chemero 2001 discussion).\n\n\nOther influential examples of dynamical explanations of cognition have\nfocused on the coordination of infants\u2019 legs for stepping\nbehavior (Thelen and Smith 1993), perseverative reaching behavior in\ninfants (Thelen et al. 2001), and categorization in a simulated agent\n(Beer 2003). Authors of these studies have been explicit in their\nbelief that traditional cognitive science should be replaced with the\ncommitments of dynamical cognitive science. Among these commitments is\na rejection of representation as a necessary component of cognition as\nwell as a view of cognition as \u201cunfolding\u201d from the\ncontinuous interactions between an organism\u2019s brain, body, and\nenvironment rather than as emerging from discrete, rule-guided,\nalgorithmic steps. This latter commitment returns us to the theme of\nembodiment. As Thelen et al. explain:\n\n\n\nTo say that cognition is embodied means that it arises from bodily\ninteractions with the world. From this point of view, cognition\ndepends on the kinds of experiences that come from having a body with\nparticular perceptual and motor capabilities that are inseparably\nlinked and that together form the matrix within which reasoning,\nmemory, emotion, language, and all other aspects of mental life are\nmeshed\u201d (2001, 1).\n\n\n\nOf course, computational cognitive scientists can accept as well that\ncognition \u201carises from bodily interactions with the\nworld,\u201d in the sense that the inputs to cognitive processes\noften arise from bodily interactions with the world. Thelen et\nal. (2001) must then mean something more than that. Presumably, the\nidea is that the body is like a component in a centrifugal governor,\nand cognition arises from the continuous interactions between the\nbody, the brain, and the world. Spivey, another prominent dynamical\ncognitive scientist, puts matters like this: \u201cFor the new\npsychology on the horizon, perhaps we are ready to discard the\nmetaphor of the mind as computer\u2026and replace it with a\ntreatment of the mind as a natural continuous event\u201d (2007, 29),\nmuch as, presumably, how the regulation of a steam engine\u2019s\nspeed is the result of the continuous interactions of the components\nof a centrifugal governor.\n\n\nOne challenge facing dynamical approaches to cognition echoes that\nconfronting roboticists like Brooks. Just as the principles underlying\nthe subsumption architecture may not scale-up in ways that can explain\nmore advanced cognitive capacities, so too one might wonder whether\ndynamical approaches to such capacities will succeed. Perhaps finger\nwagging and infant stepping behavior are not instances of cognition in\nthe first place, or are so only in an attenuated sense (Shapiro 2007;\n2013), in which case any lessons learned from their investigation have\nlittle relevance to cognitive science.\n\n\nOr perhaps as dynamical cognitive scientists examine more explicitly\ncognitive phenomena, they will find themselves in need of tools\nassociated with standard cognitive science. Spivey, a pioneer of\ndynamical systems approaches, is on friendly terms with the idea of\nrepresentations. Dietrich and Markman (2001) have argued that even\nbehavior like coordinated finger wagging depends on representation,\nalthough perhaps not a conception of representation as\n\u201cthick\u201d as one usually attributed to\ncomputationalism. Once again, it is evident that resolving some of the\ncontroversy surrounding the Replacement thesis hinges on the theory of\nrepresentation that one adopts.\n\n\nAnother criticism of dynamical cognitive science questions whether the\ndifferential equations that are offered as explanations of cognitive\nphenomena are genuinely explanatory. Chemero (2001) and Beer (2003)\ninsist that they are. The equations can be used to\npredict the behavior of organisms as well as to address\ncounterfactuals about behavior (how would the organism have\nbehaved if such and such had occurred?)\u2014both hallmarks of\nexplanation. Dietrich and Markman (2001), on the other hand, argue that\nthe equations offer only descriptions of phenomena rather than\nexplaining them (see also Eliasmith 1996; van Leeuwen 2005). Spivey,\ndespite his devotion to dynamical cognitive science, shares this view.\nDynamical systems theory, he thinks, does not explain cognition. Its\nutility consists in \u201cmodeling how the mind works\u201d\n(2007, 33, his emphasis). He continues:\n\n\n\nThe emergence of mind takes place in the medium of patterns of\nactivation across neuronal cell assemblies in conjunction with the\ninteraction of their attached sensors (eyes, ears, etc.) and effectors\n(hands, speech apparatus, etc.) with the environment in which they are\nembedded. Make no mistake about it, that is the stuff of\nwhich human minds are made: brains, bodies, and\nenvironments. Trajectories through high-dimensional state spaces are\nmerely convenient ways for scientists to describe, visualize, and\nmodel what is going on in those brains, bodies, and\nenvironments\u201d (2007, 33, his emphasis).\n\n\n\nHowever, as Zednik (2011) has noted (see also Clark 1997 and Bechtel\n1998), the differential equations on which dynamical explanations\ndepend contain terms that permit interpretation. This is what turns a\npiece of pure mathematics into applied mathematics, which routinely is\nunderstood as describing causal processes (Sauer 2010). As an instance\nof applied (rather than pure) mathematics, The Lotka Volterra\nequations, for instance, do indeed explain the dynamics of\npredator-prey populations when their terms are taken to refer to\npredation rate and reproductive rate. The equations\nreveal how predation affects the size of the prey population,\nand how depletion in the prey population affects the size of\nthe predator population, and how reproduction restores the\nprey population. So, Spivey may be right that the \u201cstuff\u201d\nof minds consists in brains, bodies, and environments, but this does\nnot preclude the differential equations that describe these\ninteractions from being explanatory. They are\nexplanatory because they describe how brains, bodies, and\nenvironments interact and the consequences ensuing from these\ninteractions.\n",
