    "main_text": "Moral Disagreement and the Semantics (and Metasemantics) of Moral Language || Further Developments and Responses\n6. Over-Generalization and Self-Defeat Worries\n\n\nWidespread disagreement occurs not only in ethics but in just about\nany domain, including the sciences. A longstanding worry about\nskeptical or antirealist arguments from moral disagreement has\ntherefore been that they generate analogous conclusions about those\nother domains as well (e.g., Brink 1989 and Huemer 2005). More\nrecently, the debate has come to focus not only on the empirical\nsciences but also on areas such as mathematics (Clarke-Doane 2020) and\nother philosophical areas besides ethics, including epistemology,\nmetaphysics and metaethics itself (e.g., Shafer-Landau 2006; Cuneo\n2007).\n\n\nAccording to the idea which underlies the concern, the skeptical or\nantirealist arguments from disagreement that apply to ethics and the\nversions that apply to the other domains are equally compelling. The\nsuggestion that this kind of parity obtains is in turn offered as an\nobjection to the arguments, as it is supposed to show that they\n\u201cover-generalize\u201d and lead to \u201ctoo much\u201d\nskepticism or antirealism. Why too much? That is, why cannot those who\nfavor the arguments just embrace their alleged wider implications as\nyet being, though perhaps surprising and unintended, perfectly\nacceptable? Two answers to that question can be discerned. (The\ndistinction between the answers is noted in Tersman 2010 and in\nP\u00f6ltzler 2020.)\n\n\nOn the first answer, the parity undermines the skeptical or\nantirealist arguments because there are independent reasons for\nrejecting the conclusions they yield when applied to the other areas\n(it is assumed here that those reasons do not in turn undermine the\nparity claim). This would arguably cast doubts on the arguments. For if\nthey yield incorrect conclusions in those contexts, why think that they\ndo a better job in the case of ethics? In other words, the idea is that\nthe parity provides resources for a reductio ad\nabsurdum of sorts of the arguments.\n\n\nWhich are the independent reasons that may back up such a challenge?\nOne option is to appeal to the sheer counter-intuitiveness of the wider\nimplications. Thus, Shafer-Landau writes:\n\n\nIf intractable disagreement [\u2026] is enough to warrant an\nantirealist diagnosis of an area, then the whole of philosophy must be\ndemoted. That simply is implausible: there really is (or isn\u2019t)\nsuch a thing as probabilistic causation, numbers without\nspatio-temporal location, actions that are both free and determined,\netc. (2006, 220).\n\n\nOthers raise more specific objections of this kind. For example,\nFrank Jackson (1999) targets arguments for moral non-cognitivism and\nclaims that they, when appropriately adjusted, provide equal support\nfor non-cognitivism about theoretical rationality (i.e., judgments\nabout when beliefs are rational). The latter view is in turn criticized\non the ground that it commits one, via certain (contestable)\nassumptions about the nature of beliefs, to think \u201cthat there are\nno believers and no beliefs\u201d (423). The absurdity of that\nimplication is taken by Jackson to refute non-cognitivism about\ntheoretical rationality. But he also takes it to undermine the\narguments that are used in its support, and therefore also the versions\nof those arguments which apply to ethics (even if no similarly absurd\nimplication can be directly derived from moral non-cognitivism).\n\n\nHow can advocates of arguments from moral disagreement respond to\nsuch challenges? The prospects depend partly on which other domain(s)\nethics is compared with. A connection of the pertinent sort with some\ndomains may result in less pressing problems than a connection with\nothers. For example, the jury is arguably still out regarding\nantirealism about mathematics, as such positions do have able defenders\n(e.g., Field 1989). So, if an overgeneralization challenge depends on\nthe implausibility of those positions, there is some room for advocates\nof the arguments to resist the objection.\n\n\nThe second answer to why the alleged parity between ethics and other\ndomains undermines arguments from disagreement may generate a more\ndecisive objection, however. On that answer, the parity makes the\narguments self-defeating and the position of their advocates\nincoherent.\n\n\nThat type of challenge can in turn take different forms. A\nstraightforward way to argue that an argument is self-defeating is to\nshow that its advocates are committed to claims that are outright\ninconsistent with it (i.e., either with its conclusion or with its\npremises). Consider for example an argument which is aimed at\nestablishing the error-theoretical thesis that all moral claims are\nfalse. If that argument can be extended to metaethics, so that it\ncommits its advocates to thinking that all metaethical claims are false\nas well (including the error theory), then they have obviously ended up\nin an awkward place.\n\n\nAnother type of self-defeat or incoherence is epistemic, as\ncontrasted with the \u201cstrict\u201d type just indicated. An\nargument is epistemically self-defeating, we may say, if we by\naffirming it commit ourselves to thinking that at least one of its\nelements is unjustified (rather than false). That is the type of\nincoherence that Derek Parfit has tried to saddle moral\nnon-cognitivists with by stressing (like Jackson) that they are\ncommitted to non-cognitivism about theoretical rationality as well.\nParfit takes the latter view to imply that \u201cto call a thing\nrational is not to state a matter of fact\u201d (2011, 409). And the\nproblem for the moral non-cognitivist which he discerns is that\n\u201c[i]f there could not be truths about what it is rational to\nbelieve [\u2026] it could not be rational to believe anything\u201d,\nincluding moral non-cognitivism.\n\n\nParfit makes a problematic move by deriving the normative claim that\nit is not rational to believe in non-cognitivism from a metanormative\nthesis about what it is to state such a claim. But it is easy enough to\ncome up with other examples of epistemic self-defeat. Thus, consider an\nargument aimed at establishing global moral skepticism. Any such\nargument must invoke some epistemological principle via which\nthe skeptical conclusion can be derived. So, if the argument applies\njust as well (mutatis mutandis) to epistemology and shows that\nwe lack justified beliefs in that area as well, then it commits its\nadvocates to thinking that one of its premises is not justified. This\ntype of incoherence is presumably less worrying than the first one, as\nit neither rules out the validity of the argument nor the truth of its\npremises. But it is clearly sufficiently worrying to raise concerns\nabout the target argument\u2019s dialectical significance (see Sampson\n2019 for discussion).\n\n\nThe above discussion illustrates that an argument\u2019s\nvulnerability to an overgeneralization challenge depends on which other\ndomain(s) the challenge focuses on, as well as on the conclusion of the\nargument (whether it pursues a local or global form of moral\nskepticism, for example). However, it also depends on how the\nargument reaches its conclusion and on which further premises it\ninvolves besides the one that postulates disagreement.\n\n\nThe last point is important. The most straightforward way to respond\nto an overgeneralization objection is to insist that there are after\nall crucial differences between the disagreement that occurs in ethics\nand that which occur in the other areas. This is what Mackie did by\nsuggesting that scientific disagreements, unlike moral ones, result\nfrom speculative inferences or inadequate evidence. Whether the\ndisagreements are different in such ways is an empirical issue which is\nhard to resolve. However, the fact that any argument from moral\ndisagreement involves further premises besides that which posits\ndisagreement leaves their advocates with other options when trying to\nchallenge the relevant parity claim. That is, it potentially allows\nthem to concede that there is \u201cjust as much\u201d or \u201cjust\nas deep\u201d disagreement in ethics and the other areas and still\nconsistently argue that the disagreement that occurs in those areas\nlicense different conclusions about their status.\n\n\nTake for example the semantical arguments which were considered in\nthe previous section. They rely on the idea that it is\ncounter-intuitive to construe certain disputes over the application of\nmoral terms as being merely apparent. In analogous disputes in\nepistemology, such as those between internalists and externalists about\nwhen to classify beliefs as \u201cjustified\u201d, such a diagnosis\nmay be more acceptable. At least, that is the upshot of a suggestion by\nWilliam Alston, who indicates that it helps explain the lack of\nconvergence in epistemology (see Alston 2005a, esp. ch. 1; Alston\n2005b, 137; and Tersman 2010).\n\n\nAdditional options are generated by the above-mentioned idea that\nalthough appeals to moral disagreement are not capable of establishing\nany skeptical or antirealist conclusions on their own, they may do so\nwhen combined with other strategies, such as the evolutionary debunking\nones. Such a combined strategy might be more promising in the moral\ncase than, say, in the epistemological case. A crucial assumption in\nevolutionary debunking arguments is that an evolutionary explanation of\nour moral convictions does not support their reliability (although it\nmay be consistent with it). Whether that is so in the case of our\nepistemic convictions is a separate issue and may call for a different\nanswer, which potentially leaves room for a different assessment of a\ncombined argument which is applied in that context (see further Tersman\n2010).\n\n\nThe availability of these ways to respond to overgeneralization\nobjections adds to the difficulties of reaching a conclusive assessment\nof them and thus also to the difficulty of assessing the arguments that\nprovide their target themselves. It thereby confirms a more general\nobservation, namely, that while each of the skeptical or antirealist\narguments surveyed above involves problematic elements, quick and\nimpatient dismissals of appeals to moral disagreement are often\nsimilarly dubious. That may be frustrating but is also unsurprising.\nThe discussion about the metaethical significance of moral disagreement\nraises intricate and philosophically central issues about knowledge,\njustification, how reference is determined, and so on. This helps to\nexplain why progress is slower than one might desire but also why the\nphenomenon commands continued attention from philosophers.\n",
