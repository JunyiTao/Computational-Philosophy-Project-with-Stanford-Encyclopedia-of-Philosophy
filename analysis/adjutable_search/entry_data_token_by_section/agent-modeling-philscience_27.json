Validation, on the other hand,\nconcerns the evaluation of the link between the model and its\npurported target. Irrespective of the purpose for which the model was\nbuilt, it always requires some degree of verification to ensure that\nits simulation code does not suffer from bugs and other unintended\nissues. The type of required validation depends on the purpose of the\nmodel and its intended target. As Mayo-Wilson and Zollman (2021) have\nargued, validation isn\u2019t always necessary for some modeling\npurposes, such as illustrating that certain events or situations are\ntheoretically possible. Models can instead be justified by\n\u201cplausibility arguments\u201d and in view of stylized\nhistorical case studies. According to Mayo-Wilson and Zollman, ABMs\nplay a role analogous to thought experiments in that they can be used\nto evoke normative intuitions, to justify counterfactual claims, to\nillustrate possibilities and impossibilities, and so on. Moreover,\nwhen it comes to questions concerning the dynamics of social systems,\nthey are more apt for the task than mere thought experiments due to\nthe complexity of such target phenomena.\n\nEmpirical validation is also not required if the function of an ABM is\nto provide a proof-of-concept or a how-possibly explanation. A model\nprovides a proof-of-concept (sometimes also called a\n\u201cproof-of-possibility\u201d or\n\u201cproof-of-principle\u201d) if it merely demonstrates a\ntheoretical possibility of a certain phenomenon (cf. Arnold 2008). The\ntarget phenomenon may be represented in an abstract, idealized way,\ndisregarding the empirical adequacy of the modeling assumptions.\nGelfert (2016: 85\u201386) distinguishes two specific functions of\nthe proof-of-concept modeling. First, a model may exemplify how an\napproach or methodology can generate a potential representation of a\ngiven target phenomenon. For instance, if an ABM shows how the\nframework of epistemic landscapes can be used to represent cognitive\ndiversity, it provides a proof-of-concept in this sense of the term.\nSecond, a model may provide results showing that a certain causal\nmechanism can be found within the model-world. For instance, if a\nhighly idealized simulation shows that a certain kind of cognitive\ndiversity results in efficient inquiry of the modeled community, it\nprovides a proof-of-concept in the latter sense. While\nproof-of-concept modeling is sometimes taken to be just a preliminary\nstep in the development of more realistic models (see for instance\nGr\u00e4bner 2018), it has also been considered as providing valuable\nphilosophical insights already on its own (see for example\n\u0160e\u0161elja 2021a).\n\nSimilarly, simulations provide how-possibly explanations\n(HPEs) if they show how a certain target phenomenon can possibly\nresult from certain preconditions (Rosenstock et al. 2017;\nGr\u00e4bner 2018; Frey & \u0160e\u0161elja 2018;\n\u0160e\u0161elja 2022b). In contrast to how-actually\nexplanations, or explanations simpliciter, which are accounts of how\nphenomena actually occur, HPEs (sometimes also called \u201cpotential\nexplanations\u201d) cover accounts of possible ways in which\nphenomena can\n occur.[16]\n According to a broad reading of the notion proposed by\nVerreault-Julien (2019), HPEs are propositions that have the form\n\u201cIt is possible that \u2018p because q\u2019.\u201d, where\np is the explanandum, q the explanans, and the\npossibility may refer to various types of modalities such as\nepistemic, logical, causal, and so forth.\n\nThe above epistemic functions\u2014providing a proof-of-concept or an\nHPE\u2014are often considered a kind of exploratory modeling, where\nthe represented target can be an abstract, theoretical phenomenon\n(Ylikoski & Aydinonat 2014; \u0160e\u0161elja 2021a). In\ncontrast, to provide explanations of empirical phenomena, many have\nargued that ABMs need to be empirically validated. This has been\nemphasized as important in case models are supposed to explain certain\npatterns from actual scientific practice, to provide evidence\nsupporting existing empirical (including historical) hypotheses, or to\nprovide suggestions for interventions through science policy (Arnold\n2014; Martini & Fern\u00e1ndez Pinto 2017; Thicke 2020;\n\u0160e\u0161elja 2021a).\n\nValidation of ABMs consists in examining whether the model is a\nreasonable representation of the target, where\n\u201creasonable\u201d may refer to different aspects of the model\n(Gr\u00e4bner 2018). For instance, we may test how well mechanisms\nrepresented in the model conform to our empirical knowledge about\nthem, whether the exogenous inputs for the model are empirically\nplausible, to what extent the output of the model replicates existing\nknowledge about the target, or whether it can predict its future\nstates. Different authors have suggested different elaborations of\nthese points with respect to ABMs in philosophy of science (see Thicke\n2020; \u0160e\u0161elja 2022b; Bedessem 2019; Politi 2021; Pesonen\n2022).\n\nWhile some of these steps may be challenging, others may be more\nfeasible. For instance Martini and Fern\u00e1ndez Pinto (2017) argue\nthat ABMs of science can be calibrated on empirical data. Harnagel\n(2019) exemplifies how this could be done by calibrating an epistemic\nlandscape model with bibliometric data.\n\nOthers have argued that results of simulations should at least be\nanalyzed in terms of their robustness. Robustness analysis\n(RA) includes: \n\n parameter RA, examining the stability of results with respect to\nchanges in parameter values of the model, usually studied by means of\nsensitivity\n analysis;[17]\n\n structural RA, which focuses on the stability of results under\nchanges in structural features of the model and its underlying\nassumptions; \n representational RA, which studies the stability of the results\nwith respect to changes in the representational framework, modelling\ntechnique, or modelling medium (Weisberg 2013: Chapter 9; Houkes,\n\u0160e\u0161elja, & Vaesen forthcoming).\n\n\nThe main purpose of RA in the context of ABMs is to help with\nunderstanding conditions (in the model world) under which results of\nthe model hold: whether they depend on specific parameter values or on\nspecific assumptions about the causal factors involved in the\nrepresented target, or whether the result is just an artifact of\ncertain idealizing assumptions in the model. This can benefit our\nunderstanding of the model and its results in at least two ways. On\nthe one hand, if an RA shows that the result holds under various\nchanges in parameter values, structural and representational\nassumptions, this may increase our confidence that the result is not a\nmere artifact of idealizations in the model (see, e.g., Kuorikoski,\nLehtinen, & Marchionni\n 2012).[18]\n On the other hand, if the result holds only for specific parameter\nvalues or under specific structural or representational assumptions,\nthis can help to delineate the context of application of the model\n(for example, the context of difficult inquiry, the context of inquiry\ninvolving a small scientific community, and so on).\n",
