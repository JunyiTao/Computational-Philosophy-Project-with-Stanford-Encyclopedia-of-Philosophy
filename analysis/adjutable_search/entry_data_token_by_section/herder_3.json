Philosophy of Language, Interpretation, and Translation\n\nThe Treatise On the Origin of Language from 1772 is\nHerder\u2019s best known work in the philosophy of language by far.\nHowever, it is in certain respects both unrepresentative and inferior\nin comparison with other works, such as the Fragments and\nOn the Cognition and Sensation, and should not monopolize\nattention.\n\nThe Treatise on the Origin is primarily concerned with the\nquestion whether the origin of language can be explained in purely\nnatural, human terms or (as S\u00fc\u00dfmilch had recently argued)\nonly in terms of a divine source. Herder argues in support of the\nformer position and against the latter. His argument is quite\npersuasive (especially when supplemented on its positive side from the\nFragments). But this will probably not constitute a modern\nphilosopher\u2019s main reason for interest in Herder\u2019s views\nabout language \u2013 deriving its zest, as it does, from a religious\nbackground that is no longer ours, and being an argument that Herder\nlong ago essentially won.\n\nOf far greater modern relevance are three interrelated theories that\nHerder develops: a philosophy of language concerning the very nature\nof language, thought, and meaning; a theory of interpretation; and a\ntheory of translation. These theories are found scattered through a\nlarge number of Herder\u2019s works.\n\nHis theories in these areas owe significant debts to predecessors\n\u2013 for example, his philosophy of language to Leibniz, Christian\nWolff, Spinoza, and Ernesti, his theory of interpretation again to\nSpinoza and Ernesti, and his theory of translation to Thomas Abbt.\nHowever, they also include important refinements and elaborations, and\noverall his contribution was enormous.\n\nThe following are the main features of his theories in these\nareas.\n",
