    "main_text": "Some ancient Greek views || Virtue and happiness\n2.2 Virtue and happiness\n\nMost of the Greek moralists think that, if we are rational, we aim at\nliving well (eu z\u00ean) or happiness\n(eudaimonia). Living well or happiness is our ultimate end in\nthat a conception of happiness serves to organize our various\nsubordinate ends, by indicating the relative importance of our ends\nand by indicating how they should fit together into some rational\noverall scheme. So the Stoics identify happiness with \u201cliving\ncoherently\u201d (homologoumen\u00f4s z\u00ean), and\nAristotle says that happiness is \u201cperfect\u201d or\n\u201ccomplete\u201d (teleios) and something distinctively\nhuman. When we are living well, our life is worthy of imitation and\npraise. For, according to the Greek moralists, that we are happy says\nsomething about us and about what we have achieved, not simply about\nthe fortunate circumstances in which we find ourselves. So they argue\nthat happiness cannot consist simply in \u201cexternal goods\u201d\nor \u201cgoods of fortune,\u201d for these goods are external to our\nown choosing and deciding. Whatever happiness is, it must take account\nof the fact that a happy life is one lived by rational agents who act\nand who are not simply victims of their circumstances.\n\nThe Greek moralists conclude that a happy life must give a prominent\nplace to the exercise of virtue, for virtuous traits of character are\nstable and enduring and are not products of fortune, but of learning\nor cultivation. Moreover, virtuous traits of character are excellences\nof the human being in that they are the best exercise of reason, which\nis the activity characteristic of human beings. In this way, the Greek\nphilosophers claim, virtuous activity completes or perfects human\nlife.\n",
