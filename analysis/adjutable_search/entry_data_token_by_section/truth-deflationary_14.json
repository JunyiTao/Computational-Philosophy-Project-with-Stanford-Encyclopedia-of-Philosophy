    "main_text": "Objections to Deflationism || Conservativeness\n4.6 Conservativeness\n\nAn ideal theory of truth will be both consistent (e.g., avoid the Liar\nParadox) and adequate (e.g., allow us to derive all the essential laws\nof truth, such as those at issue in the Generalization Problem). Yet\nit has recently been argued that even if deflationists can provide a\nconsistent theory of truth and avoid the GP, they still cannot provide\nan adequate theory.\n\nThis argument turns on the notion of a conservative extension of a\ntheory. Informally, a conservative extension of a theory is one that\ndoes not allow us to prove anything that could not be proved from the\noriginal, unextended theory. More formally, and applied to theories of\ntruth, a truth theory, \\(Tr\\) is conservative over some theory \\(T\\)\nformulated in language \\(L\\) if and only if for every sentence\n\\(\\phi\\) of \\(L\\) in which the truth predicate does not occur, if \\(Tr\n\\cup L \\vdash \\phi\\), then \\(L \\vdash \\phi\\) (where\n\u2018\\(\\vdash\\)\u2019 represents provability). Certain\ntruth theories are conservative over arithmetic \u2013 e.g., theories\nthat implicitly define truth using only the instances of some version\nof (ES) \u2013 and certain truth theories are not \u2013 e.g.,\nTarski\u2019s (1935 [1956], 1944) compositional theory. Specifically,\nthe addition of certain truth theories allows us to prove that\narithmetic is consistent, something that we cannot do if we are\nconfined to arithmetic itself.\n\nIt has been argued (a) that conservative truth theories are inadequate\nand (b) that deflationists are committed to conservative truth\ntheories. (See Shapiro 1998 and Ketland 1999; Horsten 1995 provides an\nearlier version of this argument.) We will explain the arguments for\n(a) below but to get a flavor of the arguments for (b), consider\nShapiro\u2019s rhetorical question: \u201cHow thin can the notion of\narithmetic truth be, if by invoking it we can learn more about the\nnatural numbers?\u201d Shapiro is surely right to press deflationists\non their frequent claims that truth is \u201cthin\u201d or\n\u201cinsubstantial\u201d. It might also be a worry for\ndeflationists if any adequate truth theory allowed us to derive\nnon-logical truths, if they endorse the thesis that truth is merely a\n\u201clogical property\u201d. On the other hand, deflationists\nthemselves insist that truth is an expressively useful device, and so\nthey cannot be faulted for promoting a theory of truth that allows us\nto say more about matters not involving truth.\n\nTo see an argument for (a), consider a G\u00f6del sentence, \\(G\\),\nformulated within the language of Peano Arithmetic (henceforth,\n\\(PA)\\). \\(G\\) is not a theorem of PA if PA is consistent (cf. the\nentry on\n G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems).\n But \\(G\\) becomes a theorem when PA is expanded by adding certain\nplausible principles that appear to govern a truth predicate. Thus,\nthe resultant theory of arithmetical truth is strong enough to prove G\nand appears therefore to be non-conservative over arithmetic. If, as\nhas been argued by a number of theorists, any adequate account of\ntruth will be non-conservative over a base theory, then deflationists\nappear to be in trouble.\n\nUnderstood in this way, the \u201cConservativeness Argument\u201d\n(henceforth, \\(CA)\\) is a variant of the objection considered in\nSection 4.1, claiming that truth plays an explanatory role that\ndeflationism cannot accommodate. There are several deflationary\nresponses to the CA. Field (1999) argues that the worries that arise\nfrom the claim that deflationists are in violation of explanatory\nconservativeness is unfounded. He (ibid., 537) appeals to the\nexpressive role of the truth predicate and maintains that\ndeflationists are committed to a form of \u201cexplanatory\nconservativeness\u201d only insofar as there are no explanations in\nwhich the truth predicate is not playing its generalizing role. As a\nresult, he (ibid.) notes that \u201cany use of \u2018true\u2019 in\nexplanations which derives solely from its role as a device of\ngeneralization should be perfectly acceptable\u201d. For responses to\nField, see Horsten 2011 (61) and Halbach 2011 (315\u20136).\n\nResponding to the CA, Daniel Waxman (2017) identifies two readings of\n\u2018conservativeness\u2019, one semantic and the other syntactic,\nwhich correspond to two conceptions of arithmetic. On the first\nconception, arithmetic is understood categorically as given\nby the standard model. On the second conception, arithmetic is\nunderstood axiomatically and is captured by the acceptance of\nsome first-order theory, such as PA. Waxman argues that deflationism\ncan be conservative given either conception, so that the CA does not\ngo through.\n\nJulien Murzi and Lorenzo Rossi (2018) argue that Waxman\u2019s\nattempt at marrying deflationism with conservativeness \u2013 his\n\u201cconservative deflationism\u201d \u2013 is unsuccessful. They\n(ibid.) reject the adoption of this view on the assumption that\none\u2019s conception of arithmetic is axiomatic, claiming, in\neffect, that a deflationist\u2019s commitment to a conservative\nconception of truth is misguided (cf. Halbach 2011, Horsten 2011,\nCie\u015bli\u0144ski 2015, and Galinon 2015).\n\nJody Azzouni (1999) defends the \u201cfirst-order\ndeflationist\u201d, viz., a deflationist who endorses what Waxman\n(ibid.) calls \u201cthe axiomatic conception of arithmetic\u201d and\nwhose subsequent understanding cannot rule out the eligibility of\nnon-standard models. Azzouni accepts the need to prove certain\n\u2018true\u2019-involving generalizations, but he maintains that\nthere are some generalizations that are about truths that a\nfirst-order deflationist need not prove. He further contends that if\none does extend her theory of truth in a way that allows her to\nestablish these generalizations, she should not expect her theory to\nbe conservative, nor should she continue describing it as a\ndeflationary view of truth. For a response to Azzouni\n(ibid.), see Waxman (2017, 453).\n\nIn line with Field\u2019s response to the CA, Lavinia Picollo and\nThomas Schindler (2020) argue that the conservativeness constraint\nimposed by Horsten 1995, Shapiro 1998, Ketland 1999, and others is not\na reasonable requirement to impose on deflationary accounts. They\ncontend that the insistence on conservativeness arises from making too\nmuch of the metaphor of \u201cinsubstantiality\u201d and that it\nfails to see what the function of the truth predicate really amounts\nto. Their leading idea is that, from a deflationist\u2019s\nperspective, the logico-linguistic function of the truth predicate is\nto simulate sentential and predicate quantification in a first-order\nsetting (cf. Horwich 1998a, 4, n. 1). They maintain that, for a\ndeflationist, in conjunction with first-order quantifiers, the truth\npredicate has the same function as sentential and predicate\nquantifiers. So, we should not expect the deflationist\u2019s truth\ntheory to conservatively extend its base theory.\n",
