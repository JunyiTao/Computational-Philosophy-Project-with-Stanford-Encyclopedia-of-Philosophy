    "main_text": "Life || Life as a Property\n1.3 Life as a Property\n\nMany theorists have defended the view that life, or (being) alive, is\na property, but there is considerable disagreement among them about\nwhat precisely that property is. The main views on offer are\nlife-functionalist accounts and accounts that analyze life in terms of\nDNA or genetic information or evolution by natural selection.\n\nLife-functionalism, a view introduced by Aristotle, analyzes the\nproperty alive in terms of one or more salient functions that\nliving things typically are able to perform. The salient functions\nAristotle listed were nutrition, reproduction, sensation, autonomous\nmotion, and thought. However, life-functionists disagree about how to\nformulate their account and about which functions are salient. Take\nAristotle\u2019s list. Obviously, it would be a mistake to say that\nsomething is alive if and only if it can perform all of the functions\non the list. Might we say that, for something to be alive, it\nsuffices that it be capable of one or more of the listed\nfunctions? Is being capable of one of these functions in\nparticular necessary for something to be alive? As Fred\nFeldman points out, neither of the suggestions just mentioned is\nacceptable.  Devices such as Roomba cleaning robots can do one of\nAristotle\u2019s functions, namely move themselves, but are not\nalive, so being able to do at least one listed function does not\nsuffice for being alive. Nor is it plausible to say that any one on\nthe list is necessary for being alive.  Which on the list would this\nnecessary function be?  Perhaps nutrition?  Adult silk moths are alive\nbut lack a digestive system, so are incapable of nutrition. And, as\nmany theorists have noticed, many living things cannot reproduce;\nexamples include organisms whose reproductive organs are damaged and\nhybrid animals such as mules.\n\nWhat, now, about accounts that analyze life in terms of genetic\ninformation? Feldman thinks that something like the Jonah problem\narises for any account according which being alive consists in\ncontaining DNA or other genetic information, as dead organisms contain\nDNA. A further problem for such views is that it is conceivable there\nare or could be life forms (say on other planets) that are not based\non genetic information. This latter difficulty can be avoided if we\nsay that being alive consists in having the ability to evolve, to\nengage in Darwinian evolution, assuming that evolution by natural\nselection is possible for living things that lack nucleic acid. We\nmight adopt NASA\u2019s definition, according to which life is\n\u201ca self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian\nevolution.\u201d However, accounts like NASA\u2019s are implausible\nfor a further reason: while the ability to evolve by natural selection\nis something that collections of organisms\u2014species\u2014may or\nmay not have, it is not a feature an individual organism may have.\nLater members of a species come to have features earlier members\nlacked; some of these new features may make survival more or less\nlikely, and the less \u2018fit\u2019 are weeded out of existence. An\nindividual organism, such as a particular dog, cannot undergo this\nprocess. Yet individuals may be alive.\n\nBecause he has encountered no successful account of life, no account\nexempt from counterexamples, Feldman concludes that \u201clife is a\nmystery\u201d (p. 55). Despite his skepticism, however, there is a\ngood case to be made for saying that what distinguishes objects that\nare alive from objects that are not is that the latter have a\ndistinctive sort of control over what composes them, which the former\nlack. Let us see if we can make this claim clearer.\n\nConsider ordinary composite material objects that are not alive. We\ncan assume that, at a given time, these are made up of, or composed\nof, more simple things, such as molecules, by virtue of the fact that\nthe latter meet various conditions. Among the conditions is the\nrequirement that (in some sense in need of clarification) they be\nbonded together. Take the boulder near my front porch. Among\nthe things that compose it now will be a few molecules, say four\nmolecules near the center of the boulder, that are bonded together, in\nthat each is bonded to the others, directly or indirectly (a molecule,\nA, is indirectly bonded to another molecule, B, if A is\ndirectly bonded to a molecule C that is directly bonded to B, or if A\nis bonded to a molecule that is indirectly bonded to B). The things\nthat make up the boulder are not limited to these four molecules, but\nthey are limited to molecules that are bonded to them. Nor is the\nboulder unique in this way; something similar seems true of any\ncomposite material object. A composite material object is composed of\nsome things at a time only if those things are bonded together at that\ntime.\n\nWhat sort of bonding relationship holds among the things that compose\nmaterial objects? Any answer to this question will be controversial.\nLet us set it aside, and move on to some further assumptions about the\ncomposition of nonliving composite material objects, namely that a\ngreat many of them persist for a while (some persist for a very long\ntime) and that what composes them at one time normally differs from\nwhat composes them at other times. Exactly how this works is a\ncomplicated matter, but among the conditions that such objects must\nmeet if they are to persist is that any change in their composition be\nincremental. (Even this condition is controversial. For more on\nmaterial objects, see the article Material Constitution and Ordinary\nobjects.) Consider the boulder again. Suppose that at one time,\nt0, it is composed of some molecules, and that all\nor most of these molecules remain bonded to each other until a later\ntime t1. Suppose, too, that no or few (few as\ncompared to the number of molecules that composed the boulder at\nt0) molecules come to be newly bonded to these by\nthe time that t1 rolls around. Under these\nconditions the boulder undergoes an incremental change in composition,\nand it seems plausible to say that the boulder remains in existence\nover the interval t0\u2013t1,\nand, at t1, is composed of the molecules that\nremain bonded together with the molecules that are newly attached to\nthem. Presumably, it will also survive a series of such incremental\nchanges in composition. But it will not survive drastic and sudden\nchanges. It would stop existing, for example, if the molecules that\ncompose it were suddenly dispersed.\n\nEnough said about composite material objects that are not alive. Now\nlet us see if we can shed some light on what makes living objects\nspecial. What is it that distinguishes an object that is alive from an\nobject that is not?\n\nThe answer seems to be that, normally, a live object has a distinctive\nsort of control over whether things come to be, or cease to be, part\nof it. The control in question is made possible by activities its\nconstituents themselves are capable of. Contrast objects that are not\nalive, say automobiles. What an ordinary car is composed of is settled\nfor the car by the mechanics who repair it (detaching some\nparts and affixing others), by whether it is involved in an accident\nand loses some parts, and so forth. Imagine a car that is not passive\nin this way. Imagine that its parts were somehow capable of replacing\nsome of themselves with fresh parts, without assistance from outside,\nso that the activities of the parts that compose the car today were\nresponsible for its being composed of certain parts tomorrow. That\nwould make it quite lifelike.\n\nLet us describe, in a bit more detail, what the molecules that compose\nliving objects can do:\n\nWorking together, these molecules can engage in activities that\nare integrated in conformity with (under the control of) the\ninformation that some of them carry (information that is comparable to\nblueprints and instructions), much as soldiers that make up an army\ncan engage in activities that are integrated in conformity with battle\nplans and instructions issued by the commanding officers that are\namong them.\nDeploying these activities, the molecules can self-modify, in the\nsense that they can bond new (perhaps recently ingested) molecules to\nthemselves, or prune (and excrete) some away, combining themselves in\nvarious ways (e.g., constructing cells), thereby giving way to a\nslightly different assembly of molecules at a later time, and fueling\ntheir activities by drawing upon external energy sources or stored\nreserves.\nThe molecules can also pass along their ability to self-modify,\nenabling the molecules to which they give way to continue these\nactivities, thus allowing the object they compose to sustain a given\nform (or forms) over time (say that of a dog) despite the fact that\nwhat composes that object at one time differs from what composes it at\nanother time.\n\n\nThe view on offer\u2014we might call it the compositional\naccount of life\u2014is that an object is composed of things\nthat are capable of the activities just described if and only if it is alive.\n\nThis account of life needs refinement, but it avoids at least most of\nthe worries mentioned earlier. It implies that an object may be alive\neven though it is sterile (as in the case of mules), even though it\nsurvives on stored energy (as in the case of a silk moth), and\nconceivably even if it lacks nucleic acid (yet is still composed of\nthings that engage in activities integrated in conformity with\ninformation they carry). In fact, it implies that being capable of\nnone of the items on Aristotle\u2019s list is necessary nor\nsufficient for being alive. What is more, the compositional account\njust sketched implies that being alive is a property an individual,\nsay the last remaining dodo, may bear on its own, which suggests that\nit may be alive without being capable of Darwinian evolution. At the\nsame time, it explains how collections of live individuals may evolve.\nIndividual objects are alive only if their composition is under the\ncontrol of some of their parts (e.g., nucleic acid molecules) that\ncarry information. The mechanisms by which such information is carried\ntend to be modified over time, altering the information they carry,\nand thus the features of the organisms they help shape, introducing\nmutations that may or may not facilitate survival.
