Feminists disagree\nabout whether all sex markets involve forced labor and sex. Those who\nregard commerce in sex categorically as a form of involuntary\nservitude and violence against women generally support laws that\npunish people who exchange money for sex in all circumstances\n(Jeffreys 1998; Barry 1996; Stark and Whisnant 2004). Feminists who\nhold that some sex work is performed by people who exert autonomy and\nmoral agency generally support policies that permit exchanges of sex\nfor money among consenting adults (Shrage 1996; Nussbaum 1999; Ditmore\n2005; Leigh 2004). Having such policies is consistent with vigorous\nefforts to stop human trafficking.\n\nPeter de Marneffe distinguishes four approaches to laws governing\nprostitution. (1) Prohibition involves criminalizing both the\nsale and purchase of sexual services, along with related activities,\nsuch as soliciting or operating a brothel. (2) Abolition\ninvolves criminalizing only the purchase of sexual services, along\nwith related activities such as curb (\u201ckerb\u201d) crawling or\nprocuring. (3) Regulation (legalization) involves\ngovernmental licensing and regulating of sex work businesses. (4)\nDecriminalization involves removing criminal prohibitions for\nacts of purchasing or selling sex among consenting adults (de Marneffe\n2010: 28\u201330; see also Kotiswaran 2011: 16). According to de\nMarneffe, one can defend decriminalization by appealing to the moral\nright to self-sovereignty, without supporting legalization, especially\nof large scale enterprises (de Marneffe 2013).\n\nMost feminists who oppose all sex commerce support abolition rather\nthan prohibition, because the abolition approach treats the provider\nof sexual services as a victim rather than a criminal. To prosecute\nwomen for selling sex, some argue, just compounds their victimization\nand oppression. Sweden was the first country to adopt this approach\n(Watson 2019). Other feminists support regulation, because abolition\ncan endanger sex workers by forcing their work underground in order to\nprotect customers. The Netherlands and Germany have adopted some form\nof regulation, which basically aims to reduce the harms of\nprostitution rather than eliminate it. Some feminists support\ndecriminalization (the approach now taken in New Zealand) because most\nregulatory approaches (e.g., mandatory registration and health checks\nfor providers, restricting work sites through zoning and brothels,\netc.) aim to protect customers and third parties, not sex workers, and\ncontribute to the stigmatization of prostitutes as diseased and sinful\n(Nagle 1997; Kempadoo and Doezema 1998; Almodovar 2002; Leigh 2004).\nBy contrast, regulationists worry that a laissez-faire\napproach leaves sex workers vulnerable to extreme exploitation, and\nsome explore how employment law and policy can protect sex workers, as\nwell as clients and third parties (Davis 2015; Shrage 1994 and\n1996).\n\nIn the U.S., many sexual service providers work for escort agencies,\nand thereby manage to get around anti-prostitution laws. Because the\nclient pays the agency for the escort\u2019s time and the provider\ndoes not take money directly from the client but only from the agency,\nsex between a professional escort and her client is often ignored by\nlaw enforcers. When agencies become aggressive and brazen in their\nadvertising or business practices, they are sometimes prosecuted as\nfronts for prostitution. Yet, the full force of anti-prostitution laws\ntends to be felt by women who are destitute, drug-addicted, or just\namateurs, who solicit customers directly or in public places. Under\nregimes of prohibition, anti-prostitution laws are often used against\npeople who engage in survival sex, such as homeless women or minors\nwho are not able to work in safer venues. Rarely are they used against\nmiddle class women who serially date men in pursuit of expensive\ngifts, college tuition, or living expenses (Shrage 2015).\nAnti-prostitution laws are also used to prosecute men who sexually and\ncommercially exploit women (e.g., customers and pimps), but they are\nsometimes used to prosecute the boyfriends and co-workers of\nprostitutes with whom they have consensual and supportive\nrelationships (Almodovar 1993). Police practices in the U.S.,\nhistorically, have focused on arresting and prosecuting prostitutes,\nespecially street workers, who may receive enhanced penalties if they\nknow they are HIV positive. Women make up the majority of prostitutes\nand the majority of those arrested, and minority women are\noverrepresented among those arrested (Marganski 2012).\n\nOver the past few decades, a few countries have moved toward\ntoleration and regulation of the work activities of prostitutes, yet\nthe larger trend has been toward criminalization, often with increased\npenalties for customers and pimps (see\n 100 Countries and Their Prostitution Policies).\n Feminist campaigns against prostitution and trafficking have\nmobilized to win approval for abolitionist policies. Essentially, the\nfeminist anti-pornography movement of the 1970s and 1980s has evolved\ninto the feminist anti-trafficking movement of the 21st\ncentury. Both movements treat markets in sexually explicit materials\nand services as a form of violence against women, and claim that\ntolerating them perpetuates the social subordination of women. Like\nthe anti-pornography movement in the 1980s, the anti-trafficking\nmovement is finding common ground with social conservatives who have\nreligious objections to non-marital sex, and, more recently, with\npolitical conservatives who want to keep economic migrants out of\ntheir countries.\n\nIn response to these and earlier efforts to block sex markets, an\ninternational sex workers\u2019 rights movement has formed to\nadvocate for decriminalizing consensual adult sex work. Sex worker\nactivists, many of whom are also feminists, have challenged scholarly\nresearch about their lives and work, and argue that criminalization\nrenders them less able to protect their health and exercise their\nrights (Almodovar 1993; Pendleton 1997; Highleyman 1997; Queen 1997;\nSprinkle 1998; Quan 2001; Bernstein 2000; Leigh 2004). Sex worker\norganizations are forming alliances with queer activists, labor\nunions, and human rights advocates to advance their political goals\n(Beloso 2012). In 2015, an influential human rights organization,\nAmnesty International, approved a resolution calling upon countries to\ndecriminalize adult consensual sex work, which represents a huge\nvictory for the sex workers rights movement.\n\nAdrienne Davis argues that the abolitionist movement has had more\npolitical victories because this side is more united in their aims. By\ncontrast, feminists supporting sex worker rights are deeply divided\nover whether to support regulation or decriminalization. Davis shows\nthat advocates for regulation exaggerate the similarities of sex work\nwith other types of work, while advocates for decriminalization\nexaggerate the differences. Davis proposes a \u201csexual\ngeographies\u201d approach to sex work, which recognizes that the\npotential harms depend on where and how the work is performed. Virtual\nsex work, where providers are relatively anonymous and meet with\ncustomers only online, is relatively safe. Outcall work, where sex\nworkers meet with customers in private spaces, such as hotel rooms,\nand have physical contact with their customers is significantly more\nrisky. Exotic dancers, who perform in public venues, such as bars and\nclubs, and have limited physical contact with customers, face an\nintermediate level of risk. Health and safety regulations need to\nencompass different kinds of work sites and risks, and include\nappropriate measures for each.\n\nDavis notes where current employment law in the U.S. is insufficient\nto address some of the risks that sex workers face, such as assault by\ncustomers and co-workers and invidious discrimination (Davis 2015).\nEmployment regulations typically offer greater protection for injuries\nacquired in the course of doing one\u2019s job than for incidental\nviolence and attacks. Davis also points out that sexual harassment\nwill be more difficult to define in sex work contexts. Furthermore,\nbecause preferences for race, like gender, may be built into\ncustomers\u2019 sexual tastes and fantasies, employers and courts\nmight view generally irrelevant personal characteristics as bona\nfide occupational qualifications. Nevertheless, Davis favors\ndecriminalization with regulation, and challenges feminists to improve\nemployment regulation so that there are better safeguards for sex\nwork, and other work performed in non-traditional and diverse work\nsites.\n\nIn her theoretically nuanced and fair-minded overview of both radical\nfeminist opposition to prostitution and liberal feminist advocacy of\nsex worker rights, Prabha Kotiswaran carves out a \u201cmiddle\nground\u201d feminist position. Middle ground feminism pays attention\nto the empirical realities of various sex trades and the efforts of\nsex worker organizations to protect the civil and economic rights of\ntheir members. Middle ground feminists are aware of how the sex\nindustry is gendered and, at times, critically and respectfully engage\nwith the proposals of sex worker advocates. For example, they may be\nskeptical of the alleged needs of men that the sex industry aims to\nserve, while recognizing that sex workers are not passive dupes but\nagents who exploit less than ideal background conditions. Middle\nground feminists do not treat sex commerce as monolithic, but pay\nattention to the different ways that labor and capital are organized\nin different trades. They recognize that much of sex work, like other\nlow status service work, is menial and sometimes unpleasant, but it is\nnot work that is inherently degrading or violent to those who\nvoluntarily perform it. They also recognize that sex work is\ncontinuous with much of the caregiving work women perform, as wives,\nmothers, nurses, teachers, nannies, and domestics, and do not single\nout the sex industry for assigning to women a disproportionate share\nof caregiving work in society. In this way, they do not treat sex work\nas exceptional in terms of its risks, difficulty, and larger societal\neffects. And finally, middle ground feminists are less likely to make\ncommon cause with anti-feminist sexual moralists and anti-immigrant\nconservatives, and are more likely to find common cause with unions of\nsex workers that are grappling with challenging working conditions and\neconomic realities (Kotiswaran 2011).\n",
