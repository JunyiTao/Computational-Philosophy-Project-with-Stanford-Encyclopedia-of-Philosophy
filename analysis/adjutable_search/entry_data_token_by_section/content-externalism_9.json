One objection takes the form of an alleged reductio\nad absurdum: the identification of a belief with a sentence leads\nto cognitive bloat (see Ludwig 2015). If the sentences in\nOtto\u2019s notebook can qualify as his beliefs, why not the\nsentences in an encyclopedia or the sentences found on the\ninternet\u2014both of which Otto might also access with relative\nease? Clark and Chalmers responded to this worry via two stipulations:\n(1) the subject must, at some time, have consciously endorsed this\ninformation, and (2) the subject must have entered the information in\nthe book him- or herself. It is unclear whether these will work.\nSubliminal beliefs provide a problem for the first stipulation, for\nthese are beliefs that have not been consciously endorsed by their\npossessors. If such beliefs exist, then conscious endorsement of a\nbelief does not seem to be a necessary condition of its possession.\nWith regard to the second stipulation, it is not clear if this is\ncompatible with Clark and Chalmers\u2019s underlying functionalism.\nAccording to functionalism, roughly, if something functions as belief\nthen it is a belief. From a functionalist perspective, how a belief\ncame to be acquired\u2014entered into a person\u2019s collection of\nbeliefs\u2014is not directly relevant. It would be relevant only if\nit could be shown that having personally entered the belief into\none\u2019s collection of beliefs it essential to it having the\nfunctional role of a belief. It is not clear what such an argument\nwould look like.\n\nAnother objection to state-oriented extended mind is that it\nconfuses the claim that vehicles of cognition are extended with the\n(weaker) claim that they are embedded or scaffolded\nor, equivalently, that it falls victim to a\ncoupling-constitution confusion (Adams & Aizawa 2001,\n2008; Rupert 2004). On the state-oriented interpretation, a vehicle of\ncontent is extended if it is identical with, or constituted\nby, a structure that lies outside the biological boundaries of an\nindividual. But a vehicle of cognition is (merely) embedded\nif it depends on, or is coupled with (causally or otherwise)\nstructures that lie outside the biological boundaries of the\nindividual without being identical with those structures. According to\nthis second objection, arguments for extended mind only\nestablish that vehicles of content are embedded, or coupled, with the\nenvironment rather than being extended or constituted, by the\nenvironment.\n\nA third type of objection to state-oriented extended mind is the\noriginal intentionality objection, versions of which have\nbeen leveled by Adams and Aizawa (2001, 2008), Fodor (2009), and\nRowlands (2010). In a tradition instigated by Brentano, original\nintentionality is often taken to be the hallmark of the mental.\nOriginal intentionality is defined as intentionality that is not\nderived. And derived intentionality is intentionality that derives\nfrom the mental activity, often mediated by social conventions, of a\nsubject. The intentionality of the sentence, \u201cThe Museum of\nModern Art is on 53rd Street\u201d, is clearly derived\nintentionality. In itself, this sentence is merely a pattern of shapes\nagainst a contrastive background and, in principle, could mean\nanything. To mean something, it must be interpreted, and its\nintentionality is, therefore, derived. Beliefs are mental entities. If\noriginal intentionality is the hallmark of the mental, then the\nsentence in Otto\u2019s notebook is not mental. Therefore, the\nobjection runs, it is difficult to see how it could be a belief.\n",
