Religious Philosophers and Speculative Atheists\n\nInterpretations of Hume\u2019s philosophy of religion are often made\nagainst the background of more general interpretations of his\nphilosophical intentions. From this perspective, it is not unusual to\nview Hume\u2019s views on religion in terms of the\n skepticism\n and\n naturalism\n that feature prominently in his Treatise of Human Nature\n(1739\u201340), his first and most ambitious philosophical work.\nAccording to an earlier scholarly consensus, prevalent throughout much\nof the twentieth century, Hume removed almost all the material in the\nTreatise that was concerned with religion because he was\nanxious to avoid offending the religious establishment. In his later\nworks, beginning with the Enquiry Concerning Human\nUnderstanding (1748), Hume began to present his views on this\nsubject in a more substantial and direct manner. This culminates in\nhis Natural History of Religion (1757) and Dialogues\nConcerning Natural Religion (1779; published posthumously)\n\u2013 both of which are entirely on religion. The linkage between\nthese various works, on this earlier scholarly account, is that the\nlater writings on religion are simply an extension and application of\nthe sceptical and naturalistic principles that Hume developed in his\nearlier writings.\n\nIn more recent scholarship, there has been a growing awareness that\nthe earlier scholarly consensus seriously underestimates the\nirreligious content and aims of Hume\u2019s earlier work -\nparticularly in the Treatise. Moreover, the earlier consensus\nis liable to overlook the way in which 17th and\n18th century theological controversies and debates\nstructure and shape Hume\u2019s entire philosophy \u2014 not just\nhis philosophy of religion. Put another way, Hume\u2019s philosophy\nof religion is now increasingly viewed as integral to his entire\nphilosophical system, rather than as an extraneous outgrowth or\nextension of earlier concerns and commitments that lack any specific\nirreligious motivation or orientation.\n\nIn the opening paragraph of the last section of the first\nEnquiry (XII) Hume observes that the central philosophical\ndebate of his day was waged between \u201cspeculative\natheist[s]\u201d and \u201creligious philosophers\u201d over the\nquestion of the existence of God (EU.149/12.1).\n\nThis observation highlights that the central debate that shapes\nHume\u2019s views on the subject of religion was not the\nempiricist/rationalist controversy or its\n\u201cBritish\u201d/\u201ccontinental\u201d correlate (this\ninfluential but misguided approach to early modern philosophy was\nintroduced by nineteenth century German scholarship in the wake of\nKant\u2019s \u201cCopernican Revolution\u201d in epistemology; see\nVanzo 2016), but rather a more fundamental dispute between\nphilosophical defenders of Christian belief and their\n\u201catheistic\u201d opponents. It is this divide over issues of\nreligion that is especially important for understanding the positions\nand arguments that Hume presents throughout his philosophical\nwritings.\n\nDuring the 17th and early 18th centuries British\nphilosophy gave rise to two powerful but conflicting philosophical\noutlooks. On one hand, this era has been described as \u201cthe\ngolden period of English theology\u201d (Stephen 1962, 66) because of\nthe deepening alliance between philosophy and theology. It was, in\nparticular, a major concern of a number of divines at this time to\nshow that basic Christian theology could be provided with a rational\ndefence \u2014 one that would ward off all threat of scepticism and\natheism. Among the leading representatives of this tradition were\nHenry More, Ralph Cudworth,\n John Locke,\n Samuel Clarke,\n George Berkeley\n and Joseph Butler. (More and\nCudworth were both\n Cambridge Platonists.)\n On the other hand, in opposition to this Christian tradition, there\nexisted a sceptical tradition of which the greatest representative was\n Thomas Hobbes.\n Closely aligned with Hobbes was the work of Benedict Spinoza, whose\nTheological-Political Treatise (1670) and Ethics\n(1677) pursued a number of perceived Hobbesean themes in a more\nexplicit and radical fashion, including anti-clericalism, biblical\ncriticism, scepticism about miracles, materialism and necessitarianism\n(see Israel 2001). Almost all the defenders of basic Christian\ntheology during this period had their arguments targeted against the\n\u201catheistic\u201d doctrines of Hobbes and Spinoza.\n\nAnother important source of motivation for \u201catheistic\u201d or\nirreligious thought during this period was the sceptical philosophy of\nPyrrho, as presented in the writings of Sextus Empiricus.\n Pierre Bayle\n describes the significance of Pyrrhonianism in his influential\nHistorical and Critical Dictionary (1697, 2nd ed. 1702), a\nwork that we know was read carefully by the young Hume. In his article\non \u201cPyrrho\u201d Bayle argues that whereas \u201cnatural\nsciences\u201d and \u201cthe state\u201d have no reason to be\nafraid of Pyrrhonism, things stand otherwise as regards \u201cdivine\nscience\u201d (i.e. theology) and \u201creligion,\u201d for the\nlatter, he says, require \u201ccertainty,\u201d and so\n\u201ccollapse\u201d when subjected to Pyrrhonian skepticism (Bayle,\nDictionary, Note B; p. 195).\n\nBayle\u2019s own view that philosophy and theology should be sharply\nseparated, on the ground that the doctrines of theology could not be\ndefended by reason and were therefore a matter of faith alone, brought\nhis work under the suspicion of atheism. In general, it was common\namong Hume\u2019s immediate predecessors and contemporaries to\nassociate scepticism closely with atheism. (Hume\u2019s writings\nallude to this at various points. See, e.g., MEM, Sect. II, #40; and\nD, Introduction.)\n\nA significant development in the late 17th century relating\nto the war against the perceived atheism of Hobbes, Spinoza, and their\nfollowers was the establishment of the Boyle Lectures in 1691. These\nlectures, founded by the distinguished scientist Robert Boyle, served\nthe purpose of defending basic Christian theology against\n\u201cnotorious Infidels,\u201d in particular atheists (see\nMacIntosh 2006) \u2014 a project that had considerable overlap with\nthe project outlined half a century earlier by Descartes in the Letter\nof Dedication of the Meditations on First Philosophy (1641).\nBy the early 18th century the Boyle lectures had become the\nfocus for the debate between religious philosophers (amongst which the\nNewtonians emerged as particularly important and influential) and\nspeculative atheists. The most influential of the Boyle lecturers was\nSamuel Clarke, who was a close friend of Newton\u2019s and widely\nrecognized as the most able defender of Newtonian philosophy and\ntheology. Clarke\u2019s Boyle lectures, published in 1704 as A\nDemonstration of the Being and Attributes of God, developed an\nelaborate version of the cosmological argument (or \u201cargument\na priori\u201d as it was then called), an argument then very\nmuch in vogue, having been sketched in influential books like John\nLocke\u2019s Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690).\nLocke and Clarke took the cosmological argument to be capable of\ndemonstrating the existence of God with mathematical certainty.\nClarke\u2019s version of this argument enjoyed considerable prestige\nthroughout the first half of the 18th century and found\nstrong support among several Scottish philosophers of considerable\nreputation at this time. In addition to the cosmological argument, the\ndesign argument was also widely endorsed by religious philosophers and\nscientists at this time, including Newton himself. It is these two\nalleged proofs for the existence of God that Hume\u2019s\nphilosophical writings are particularly concerned with\ndiscrediting.\n\nHume\u2019s Scottish contemporaries were heavily involved in the\ngeneral British debate between \u201creligious philosophers\u201d\nand \u201cspeculative atheists.\u201d Prominent Scottish defenders\nof Clarke-inspired cosmological arguments included Andrew Baxter, and\nprominent Scottish defenders of design arguments included the\nNewtonians George Cheyne and Colin Maclaurin. There is little doubt\nthat Hume was well aware of these figures; he was a student at\nEdinburgh University in the 1720s, where Maclaurin was professor, and\nas a young man he lived in the Borders area of Scotland, where Baxter\nwas active.\n\nIn Hume\u2019s own lifetime his philosophy was widely viewed by\nScottish, English and Continental critics in both Scotland and England\nas being \u201catheistic\u201d in character and generally hostile to\nreligion, not only on account of late writings like the\nDialogues, but also on account of Hume\u2019s early\nwritings, including the Treatise. One of the most significant\ndevelopments in recent Hume scholarship is the rehabilitation of this\nearlier view.\n2. Empiricism, Scepticism and the Very Idea of God\n\nA good starting point for understanding Hume\u2019s views on theism\nis his empiricism. The potential for empiricism to produce skeptical\nconclusions concerning our knowledge of God was already apparent in\nHobbes\u2019s work, which embraced similar empiricist principles\nconcerning the foundations of human knowledge. The most striking\naspect of Hobbes\u2019s position on this subject is his claim that we\nhave no positive idea of a God with infinite attributes.\n\nWhatever we imagine is finite. Therefore there is no idea or\nconception of anything we call infinite. No man can have in\nhis mind an image of infinite magnitude, nor conceive infinite\nswiftness, infinite time, or infinite force, or infinite power\n\u2026 And therefore the name of God is used, not to make\nus conceive him (for he is incomprehensible, and his\ngreatness and power are inconceivable), but that we may honour him.\nAlso because whatsoever \u2026 we conceive has been perceived first\nby sense, either all at once or by parts, a man can have no thought\nrepresenting anything not subject to sense\u2026 (Hobbes,\nLeviathan, 3.12)\n\n\nConsistent with this view Hobbes provides a minimalist and negative\ntheology. According to Hobbes, our idea of God is like a blind\nman\u2019s idea of fire. A blind man lacks any positive idea of\n\u201cwhat kind of thing fire is,\u201d knowing only that fire is\n\u201cthat somewhat\u201d that \u201cwarm[eth] him\u201d;\nanalogously, we lack any positive idea of a God with infinite\nattributes, and understand by \u201cGod\u201d only the cause of the\nworld (Hobbes, Citizen, 15.14; Leviathan, 31.15).\nAttempts to ascribe further positive attributes to God are rejected as\nanthropomorphism (Hobbes, Human Nature, 11.3;\nLeviathan, 31.25-28; Citizen, 15.14). Clearly, then,\nHobbes employs his empiricist principles to emphasize the\n\u201cnarrow limits of our phantasy,\u201d putting knowledge of a\nGod with infinite attributes beyond the scope of human\nunderstanding.\n\nTheists responding to Hobbes\u2019s empiricist scepticism concerning\nour idea of God had three basic options. One was to reject his\nempiricist principles concerning the origin of all our ideas and argue\nthat our idea of God is either innate or derived from reason. Another\nalternative was to accept empiricism about the origin of our ideas but\ndeny that this has any sceptical implications for our knowledge of\nGod. This is the route Locke takes in his Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding, where it is argued that our idea of God is a\ncomplex idea arrived at by augmenting simple ideas acquired through\nreflection on our experience of the operations of our minds. A third\nalternative, which had been favoured by Catholic and Protestant\northodoxy, was to allow the experiential origin of ideas but then go\non to say that ideas of creaturely attributes can be applied to God\nanalogously, on the basis of a supposed degree of similarity or\nresemblance between God and creatures. This route was taken by, among\nothers, the Irish theologian Peter Browne in Things Divine and\nSupernatural Conceived by Analogy with Things Natural and Human\n(1733). This issue concerning our idea of God was fundamental to the\nwhole early 18th century theological debate as it concerned\nthe various schools of \u201creligious philosophers.\u201d During\nthis period freethinking critics (e.g. Toland and Collins) used these\ndifficulties to argue, along the lines of Hobbes, that we have no\nclear idea of God. Hume\u2019s views about the origins and nature of\nour ideas should be considered with reference to this controversy.\n\nWhat is fundamental to Hume\u2019s entire empiricist program in the\nTreatise is his \u201ccopy-principle\u201d or the claim\nthat \u201call our ideas, or weak perceptions, are derived from our\nimpressions, or strong perceptions, and that we can never think of any\nthing which we have not seen without us, or felt in our minds\u201d\n(TA, 16\u20137/ 647). Hume goes on to observe that this\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d is of considerable importance \u201cfor\ndeciding all controversies concerning ideas\u201d. \u201cWhenever\nany idea is ambiguous\u201d, he continues, we always have\n\u201crecourse to the impression, which must render it clear and\nprecise\u201d (TA, 7/648). If we suspect that \u201cany\nphilosophical term has no idea annexed to it\u201d, Hume suggests, we\ncan always ask \u201cfrom what impression that pretended idea is\nderived?\u201d (TA, 7/648\u20139) If no impression can be produced,\nwe must conclude \u201cthe term is altogether insignificant\u201d\n(TA, 7/ 648).\n\nGiven the prominence of the copy-principle in Hume\u2019s\nphilosophical system, and its obvious relevance to the debate\nconcerning our idea of God, it is surprising to find that in the\nTreatise Hume barely mentions our idea of God, much less\nprovides any detailed account of the nature and origin of this idea.\nIt would be a mistake, however, to conclude from this that theological\nproblems, as they concern our idea of God, are far from his mind. On\nthe contrary, neglecting this topic, in face of the ongoing debate and\nits obvious relevance for Hume\u2019s philosophy in the\nTreatise, could be a way of suggesting a (strong) sceptical\nmessage.\n\nIn the Enquiry, Hume offers a Lockean account of the\norigination of the idea of God, saying that \u201c[the] idea of God,\nas meaning an infinitely intelligent, wise, and good Being, arises\nfrom reflecting on the operations of our own mind, and augmenting,\nwithout limit, those qualities of goodness and wisdom\u201d (EU,\n2.6/19; and cp. TA, 26/656; EU, 7.25/72). Here our idea of God is\ntreated as complex and derived from simple ideas based on reflection\non the operations of our own minds, which we \u201caugment without\nlimit.\u201d We would be misguided if we took this account at face\nvalue, however.  For, to start with, we know from Hume\u2019s\nprivate correspondence that he considered the idea of God to be\nproblematic, writing to William Mure in 1743 (i.e., in the period\nbetween the publication of the Treatise and Enquiry)\nthat inasmuch as God is not the object of \u201cany Passion or\nAffection\u201d or of \u201cthe Senses or Imagination,\u201d and\n\u201cvery little of the Understanding\u201d as well, it follows\nthat God is \u201cunknown to us\u201d and cannot \u201cexcite any\nAffection\u201d in us (LET, I, 51/#21). Hume goes on to recognize\nthat \u201centhusiasts\u201d distort God \u201cinto a Resemblance\nwith themselves, & by that means render him more\ncomprehensible,\u201d but this, he notes, is a degradation of the\nidea of God. This take on the idea of God is clearly more Hobbesean\nthan Lockean.\n\n\nSecond, in Enquiry XI Hume presents a critique of our\n\u201cconjectures\u201d about God\u2019s nature and attributes, as\nbased on evidence of design in this world. In this section Hume\nemphasizes the point that God\u2019s being is \u201cso different,\nand so much superior\u201d to human nature that we are not able to\nform any clear or distinct idea of his nature and attributes, much\nless one based on our own qualities and characteristics.\n\nThe Deity is known to us only by his productions, and is a single\nbeing in the universe, not comprehended under any species or genus,\nfrom whose experienced attributes or qualities, we can, by analogy,\ninfer any attribute or quality in him\u2026 (EU, 11.26 / 144)\n\n\nIn a later passage Hume goes on to remark that God is \u201ca Being,\nso remote and incomprehensible, who bears much less analogy\nto any other being in the universe than the sun to a waxen taper, and\nwho discovers himself only by some faint traces or outlines, beyond\nwhich we have no authority to ascribe to him any attribute or\nperfection\u201d (EU, 11.27 / 145\u20136 \u2014 my emphasis). It\nis, evidently, Hume\u2019s considered view that in respect of our\nidea of God we lack the relevant impressions that can serve as the\norigin of this idea. \n\nThird, in Dialogues X Hume goes on to argue, even more\nradically, that the analogy between creaturely attributes and the\nsupposed attributes of God is not only weak, but breaks down\naltogether in view of the evil that the theist believes God allows in\nthe world. For since \u201cneither man nor any animal are\nhappy\u201d it follows that an omnipotent God must \u201cnot will\ntheir happiness,\u201d in which case God\u2019s \u201cbenevolence\nand mercy\u201d cannot in any significant way be said to resemble or\nbe analogous to \u201cthe benevolence and mercy of men\u201d\n(Dialogues, X, 23).\n\nWe see then that Hume is in substantial agreement with Hobbes that in\nrespect of our idea of God, our predicament is much the same as that\nof a blind man trying to form the idea of fire. \n3. The Cosmological Argument and God\u2019s Necessary-Existence\n\nIn Lucretius\u2019s The Nature of the Universe \u2013 which\nis the greatest classical statement of a system of atheism \u2013 it\nis argued that it is impossible that matter was created and that it\nmust, therefore, be eternal and uncreated. The basis of this argument\nis the general causal principle: \u201cNothing can come from\nnothing\u201d [Ex nihilo, nihil fit.] In the late\n17th and early 18th centuries this principle was\nturned against the Epicurean atheism of thinkers such as Lucretius and\nhis modern counterparts. More specifically, the principle\n\u201cNothing can come from nothing\u201d was taken to ground two\nderived principles of causal reasoning. The first is the causal maxim:\nWhatever exists must have a cause or ground for its\nexistence. The second principle is that of causal adequacy or the\norder of causes: No cause can produce or give rise to perfections\nor excellences that it does not itself possess. These two\n(derived) causal principles were used by religious philosophers like\nCudworth, Locke and Clarke as the philosophical foundation for their\nown versions of the cosmological argument. It fell to Hume to argue\nthat the causal foundations of this argument were too weak to support\nthe philosophical weight placed upon them.\n\nHume\u2019s most explicit assault on the cosmological argument\nappears in Part IX of his Dialogues. In this context, he\nspecifically mentions Clarke and condenses his argument into a few\nsentences:\n\nWhatever exists must have a cause or reason of its existence; it being\nabsolutely impossible for any thing to produce itself, or to be the\ncause of its own existence. In mounting up, therefore, from effects to\ncauses, we must either go on in tracing an infinite succession,\nwithout any ultimate cause at all, or must at last have recourse to\nsome ultimate cause, that is necessarily existent\u2026 (D,\n9.3/188 \u2014 Hume\u2019s emphasis)\n\n\nThere cannot be an infinite succession of causes and effects without\nany ultimate cause at all, the argument runs, because this would fail\nto provide any cause or reason for the whole series or causal chain.\nThat is to say, we need to explain \u201cwhy this particular\nsuccession of causes existed from eternity, and not any other\nsuccession, or no succession at all.\u201d Clearly the series cannot\nbe produced by nothing. We may conclude, therefore, that the universe\nmust have arisen from some \u201cnecessarily existent Being, who\ncarries the Reason of his existence in himself; and who cannot be\nsupposed not to exist without an express contradiction.\u201d (D,\n9.3/189). This necessarily existent being is God.\n\nIt is also essential to this argument to prove that the\nnecessarily-existent being cannot be (unintelligent, inactive) matter.\nClarke\u2019s argument, as paraphrased by Hume, is based on the\ncontingency of matter and particular form of the world.\n\n\u201cAny particle of matter\u201d, it is said, \u201cmay be\nconceived to be annihilated; and any form may be conceived to be\naltered.\u201d Such an annihilation or alteration, therefore, is not\nimpossible. (D, 9.7/190)\n\n\nAnother argument that Clarke provides (not mentioned by Hume in the\nDialogues) to show that it is impossible for matter to be\n\u201cthe final and original being\u201d is that we cannot explain\nthe origin of motion and intelligence in the world if matter is the\nfirst, original self-existing being. The basic principle that Clarke\nrelies on to establish this conclusion is, once again, that\n\u201cnothing can come from nothing\u201d. In this case the\nprinciple is interpreted as implying that \u201cin order of causes\nand effects, the cause must always be more excellent than the\neffect.\u201d [Clarke, Demonstration, 38] It is impossible,\non this account, \u201cthat any effect should have any perfection,\nwhich was not in the cause\u201d. On the basis of this principle\n\u2014 the causal adequacy principle \u2014 Clarke and other\nlike-minded thinkers maintained that it is demonstratively certain\nthat matter and motion cannot produce thought and intelligence.\nTherefore, the original, self-existent being must be an intelligent,\nimmaterial being. To suppose the contrary, they claim, would be a\nplain contradiction.\n\nIt is evident that the foundations of this argument rest with the\nrelated causal principles that everything must have a cause or ground\nfor its existence and that no effect can have any perfection that is\nnot also in its cause. To deny either of these causal principles is,\non Clarke\u2019s account, to reject the more general principle that\n\u201cnothing can come from nothing\u201d (a principle that the\natheists such as Lucretius have themselves acknowledged). In the\nTreatise Hume develops an account of causation that directly\ncontradicts these causal principles. Contrary to the causal maxim,\nHume maintains, it is entirely possible for us to conceive of\nsomething beginning to exist without any cause. To deny this implies\nno contradiction and, therefore, this principle is neither intuitively\nnor demonstratively certain (T, 1.3.3/78\u20139). Granting that\nwhatever is conceivable or non-contradictory is possible, it follows\nthat it is possible that there exists a causal series that came into\nexistence uncreated or has always existed without any further cause or\nground for its existence. \n\nJust as Hume rejects the claim that it is absurd or contradictory to\ndeny that there must be a cause for everything that comes into\nexistence, he also denies that it is impossible for an effect to have\nperfections that its cause lacks. Contrary to this view, Hume\nmaintains, \u201cany thing may produce any thing\u201d (T, 1.3.15.1/\n173; 1.4.5.30/247\u20138; EU, 12.29/ 164). All that there is to\ncausation, as we experience and know it, is the constant conjunction\nor regular succession of resembling objects. In other words, to say X\ncauses Y is to say that in our experience we discover that objects\nresembling X\u2019s are always prior to and contiguous with objects\nresembling Y\u2019s (T, 1.3.14.28\u201331/ 168\u201370). Our idea\nof causation as it exists in the world reaches no further than this.\n(See the entry on\n the metaphysics of causation.)\n On this basis Hume argues:\n\nCreation, annihilation, motion, reason, volition; all these may arise\nfrom one another, or from any other object we can imagine. (T,\n1.3.15.1/173; cp. 1.4.5.30/247)\n\n\nIn this way, Hume stands Lucretius on his head with a view to refuting\nthose \u201creligious philosophers\u201d who aimed to refute\nLucretius\u2019s atheism using his own causal principle:\n\nThat impious maxim of the ancient philosophy, Ex nihilo, nihil\nfit, by which the creation of matter was excluded, ceases to be a\nmaxim, according to my philosophy. Not only the will of the supreme\nBeing may create matter; but, for aught we know a priori, the\nwill of any other being might create it, or any other cause, that the\nmost whimsical imagination can assign. (EU, 12.29n/164n)\n\n\nClearly, however, under cover of rejecting Lucretius\u2019s general\ncausal principle, Hume has established that a priori it is not\nimpossible for matter and motion to produce thought and consciousness.\nOn the contrary, not only is it a priori possible for matter to be as\n\u201cactive\u201d as thought and consciousness, and actually\nproduce thought and consciousness, this is exactly what we discover\nfrom experience (T, 1.4.5.31/248\u20139). The clear implication of\nall this is that there is no basis for the a priori claim that the\nmaterial world is incapable of activity or producing thought and\nconsciousness. Indeed, experience shows that this claim is actually\nfalse. There is, therefore, no basis for the a priori claim that there\nnecessarily exists an original, self-existing being that is an\nimmaterial, intelligent being (i.e., God).\n\nClosely related to Hume\u2019s critique of all efforts to demonstrate\nthe existence of any being by means of a priori reasoning, is his\ncritique of the notion of necessary-existence in general. In the\nDialogues Hume explains his position as follows:\n\n\u2026 there is an evident absurdity in pretending to demonstrate a\nmatter of fact, or to prove it by arguments a priori. Nothing is\ndemonstrable, unless the contrary is a contradiction. Nothing, that is\ndirectly conceivable, implies a contradiction. Whatever we conceive as\nexistent, we can also conceive as non-existent. There is no being,\ntherefore, whose non-existence implies a contradiction. Consequently\nthere is no Being whose contradiction is demonstrable. (D, 9.5/189;\ncp, EU,12.28\u201334/ 164\u20135)\n\n\nAs Hume puts the point in the Treatise, when we believe that\nGod exists our \u201cidea of him neither encreases nor\ndiminishes\u201d \u2014 we simply conceive of \u201cthe idea of\nsuch, as he is represented to us\u201d in a more forceful or vivid\nmanner (T, 1.3.7.2/94; cp. 1.3.7.5n/96n). We join nothing to our idea\nof his parts or qualities, nor do we have a distinct and separate idea\nof existence itself (e.g., qua abstract idea). In so far as we have\nany clear idea of God we can conceive of him existing or not existing.\nFrom these observations Hume draws the conclusion that the words\n\u201cnecessary existence, have no meaning; or what is the same\nthing, none that is consistent\u201d (D, 9.6/190).\n\nHume applies this point directly to the claim that \u201cthe material\nworld is not the necessarily existent Being\u201d. If it is possible\nto conceive of the material world as not existing the same is true of\nGod: we can imagine him \u201cto be non-existent, or his attributes\nto be altered\u201d (D, 9.7/190). If God\u2019s non-existence is\nimpossible because of some \u201cunknown inconceivable\nqualities\u201d, why should we assume that these qualities do not\nbelong to matter? All this puts an end to the efforts of Clarke and\nlikeminded \u201creligious philosophers\u201d to prove that God\nnecessarily-exists.\n\nAnother argument that Hume presents, in criticism of the cosmological\nargument, concerns the assumption that an infinite series of causes\nand effects requires some explanation or cause for its existence.\n\n\u2026 The WHOLE, you say, wants a cause. I answer, that the uniting\nof these parts into a whole, like the uniting of several distinct\ncounties into one kingdom, or several distinct members into one body,\nis performed merely by an arbitrary act of mind, and has no influence\non the nature of things. Did I show you the particular cause of each\nindividual in a collection of twenty particles of matter, I should\nthink it very unreasonable, should you afterwards ask me, what was the\ncause of the whole twenty. This is sufficiently explained in\nexplaining the cause of the parts. (D, 9.9/190\u20131)\n\n\nThe step in this argument that seems most questionable is the claim\nthat because each element in the causal chain has been explained, in\nterms of some earlier member of the chain, we have \u201csufficiently\nexplained\u201d why there exists any such chain or why this\nparticular chain exists. Critics will argue that this has plainly not\nbeen done. One response to this is argue that it is a philosophical\nmistake to look for an explanation of this kind, on the ground that a\ncause must be prior to its effect in time and it is evident that\nnothing can be prior to a series of causes and effects that is without\nany beginning or exists for eternity (D, 9.8/190). Related to this\npoint, it may also be argued, more generally, that it is impossible\nfor us to frame any idea of Creation (i.e., God creating the whole\nworld) because our idea of causation presupposes a framework of ideas\nthat already requires the existence of objects in the world\n(cp.T,1.3.15.1\u201310/ 173\u20134). That is to say, it is a mistake\nto conceive of the cosmological question in causal terms because this\ntakes us beyond the scope of human ideas and understanding.\nHume\u2019s general analysis of the nature of causation, as developed\nin the Treatise and first Enquiry, makes clear that\nthis is his view of this matter. For human beings, therefore, given\nour epistemological limits, the existence of this world must be\ntreated as a basic brute fact that is incapable (for us) of further\nexplanation.\n\nFinally, Hume\u2019s against the notion of necessary existence have\nobvious relevance also for Descartes\u2019s effort, in\nMeditations III, to prove that God necessarily exists by way\nof reasoning from our (innate) idea of God. Since a priori any thing\nmay cause any thing, it follows that even if we had an idea of a\nperfect being there would be no basis for the claim that God must be\nthe source of this idea. Similarly, since we have no (abstract) idea\nof existence, distinct from the conception of particular objects,\nthere is no basis for claiming, as does Descartes in\nMeditations V, that the idea of God implies his actual\nexistence. Whatever idea of God we are able to frame is an idea of\nsomething that we can conceive of as either existing or not existing.\nExistence is not some further quality or \u201cperfection\u201d\nwhich a being possesses along with its other attributes. There is,\ntherefore, no contradiction involved in denying that God exists.\n4. The Argument from Design\n\nAn obvious limitation of the cosmological and ontological arguments is\nthat they are highly abstract and, while they may convince a few\nphilosophers and theologians, they cannot serve as the basis of\nreligious belief for most ordinary people (D, 9.11/191\u20132).\nThings are very different, however, in the case of the argument from\ndesign. The defenders of this argument have often claimed that it is\nso obvious and convincing that even sceptics cannot seriously doubt or\ndeny it (D,3.7/154, 12.2/214). The argument from design is discussed\nby Hume in Section XI of the first Enquiry and, at greater\nlength, in the Dialogues (Parts II-VIII, XII). There are also\nseveral references to the argument from design in The Natural\nHistory of Religion (NHR, Intro, 5.2,6.1, 15.1), where Hume\npresents it as the most plausible and convincing of the various\narguments that have been advanced on this topic (cp. LG, 24\u20136).\nIt is, nevertheless, Hume\u2019s plain intention throughout these\nworks to expose the weaknesses and limitations of this argument.\n\nAt the beginning of Part II of the Dialogues Philo, who\nspeaks as the \u201ccareless sceptic\u201d and is generally\nidentified as representing Hume\u2019s views, presents a challenge to\nthe orthodox theist position similar to that which Hobbes had\npresented.\n\nBut surely, where reasonable men treat these subjects, the question\ncan never be concerning the being, but only the nature of the Deity.\nThe former truth, as you well observe, is unquestionable and\nself-evident. Nothing exists without a cause; and the original cause\nof this universe (whatever it be) we call GOD; and piously ascribe to\nhim every species of perfection. \u2026 But as all perfection is\nentirely relative, we ought never to imagine, that we comprehend the\nattributes of this divine Being, or to suppose, that his perfections\nhave any analogy or likeness to the perfections of a human creature.\n(D,2.3/142)\n\n\nIn this way, it is Philo\u2019s position that all we know about God\nis that he exists (qua cause of the universe) but beyond this we have\nno idea or understanding of his nature or attributes. \u201cOur\nideas\u201d, says Philo, \u201creach no further than experience: We\nhave no experience of divine attributes and operations: I need not\nconclude my syllogism: You can draw the inference yourself.\u201d The\nconclusion is that God\u2019s nature is \u201cadorably mysterious\nand incomprehensible.\u201d (D,2.4/143)\n\nPhilo\u2019s sceptical challenge is met by Cleanthes, who has the\nrole in the Dialogues of presenting and defending the\nargument from design.\n\nLook around the world: Contemplate the whole and every part of it: You\nwill find it to be nothing but one great machine, subdivided into an\ninfinite number of lesser machines\u2026 All these various machines,\nand even their most minute parts, are adjusted to each other with an\naccuracy, which ravishes into admiration all men, who have ever\ncontemplated them. The curious adapting of means to ends, exceeds the\nproductions of human contrivance; of human design, thought, wisdom,\nand intelligence. Since, therefore the effects resemble each other, we\nare led to infer, by all the rules of analogy, that the causes also\nresemble; and that the Author of nature is somewhat similar to the\nmind of man; though possessed of much larger faculties,\nproportioned to the grandeur of the work, which he has executed. (D,\n2.5/143 \u2014 our emphasis)\n\n\nThe structure of this argument seems clear. (1) There is an analogy or\nresemblance between the world and man-made machines in respect of\ntheir shared features of order, structure, harmony and the evident way\nthat their parts are suited to perform some function or serve certain\nends. (2) When we discover an object that has these features (i.e.\norder, structure, harmony, etc.) we infer that these objects have not\njust come together by chance. For example, if we discover a watch or a\nhouse our experience leads us to believe \u201cthat there is an\noriginal principle of order in mind, not in matter\u201d (D,\n2.14/146; cp. EU, 4.4/26; 5.7/45). (3) The principle that guides this\ninference is that similar effects must arise from similar causes. (4)\nIt follows from these premises that we can (rationally) infer the\nexistence of God and \u201chis similarity to human mind and\nintelligence\u201d (D, 2.5/143).\n\nPhilo maintains that this argument, although methodologically sound in\nso far as it is based on experience and not on a priori reasoning,\nnevertheless falls well short of what it claims to prove. The first\npoint that Philo draws our attention to is the weakness of the analogy\nbetween the world and \u201chuman productions\u201d. When there is a\nclose resemblance or \u201cexact similarity\u201d among objects then\nwe may infer a similar cause.\n\nThe exact similarity of the cases gives us a perfect assurance of a\nsimilar event; and a stronger evidence is never desired nor sought\nafter. But wherever you depart, in the least, from the similarity of\nthe cases, you diminish proportionably the evidence: and may at last\nbring it to a very weak analogy, which is confessedly liable to error\nand uncertainty. (D, 2.7/144; cp. T, 1.3.12.25/142)\n\n\nThe importance of this for the argument from design is clear. The gap\nbetween human artifacts and the whole universe is \u201cvast\u201d\n(D, 2.8/144, 12.6/216\u20137, 12.33/227). Any resemblance or\nsimilarity of this kind is so remote and slight that all reasoning on\nthis basis is \u201cboth uncertain and useless\u201d (EU, 11.23\n/142). When we use analogies that are this weak and imperfect then\nonly doubt and uncertainty can result (D, 2.17/147,5.1/165; T,\n1.3.12.25/142).\n\nIn order to bring out the particular difficulties of the argument from\ndesign, and the way in which it has only the fa\u00e7ade of ordinary\nexperimental reasoning, Hume suggests the analogy of a house. When we\nsee a house we naturally and reasonably conclude (i.e., with moral\ncertainty) that \u201cit had an architect or builder; because this is\nprecisely that species of effect, which we have experienced to proceed\nfrom that species of cause\u201d (D, 2.8/144). When we consider the\nuniverse, however, things are very different. In this case, we have\nexperience of a unique effect: the universe. Moreover, our experience\nof this effect is limited to a small part or a \u201cnarrow\ncorner\u201d of it \u2014 from which we must make conjectures about\nthe whole. Beyond this, we have no experience at all of its cause.\nClearly, then, in a case of this kind we have no experience of\n\u201ctwo species of objects\u201d that are constantly conjoined on\nthe basis of which we may draw some (reliable) inference (EU,\n11.30/148; D, 2.24/149\u201350).\n\nThe contrast between ordinary cases of inference (e.g., house to human\nbuilder) and the design argument may be illustrated this way.\n\n\n\nX\n=\ncauses (builders, architects, etc.) \n\nY\n=\neffects (houses) \n\n\n\n1. \nY1 ---- X1\n \n\n2. \nY2 ---- X2\n \n\n3. \nY3 ---- X3\n\u2026 \n\n*. \nYn /\n[Xn]\n? \n\n\n\nIn this case our experience of the constant conjunction of\nXs/Ys enables us\nto draw the inference to\nXn, the unobserved cause\nof Yn. Our experience is\nof a series of conjunctions (1,2,3) where there is a\nclose resemblance within each species of objects (i.e., among\nXs and among Ys).\nWe have direct experience of both kinds of objects (i.e.,\nboth Xs and Ys). In the\ncase of the design argument our inference has this form.\n\n\n\nZ\n=\ncause (God/creator) \n\nW\n=\neffect (world/universe) \n\n\n* <W> / [Z*]\n?\n\n\nWe have experience of only one W\n(i.e., our experience of W is unique). Our\nexperience of W is partial and\nincomplete (hence <W>), since\nwe know only a small part of it in both spacial and temporal terms. We\nhave no experience of any Zs at\nall. In these circumstances the only basis for drawing any conclusion\nabout the nature of Z* from our (unique and\npartial) experience of W is by supposing\nthat W bears some resemblance to objects\nsuch as Ys, broadly conceived to cover all\nhuman artifacts and productions. There is, however, a vast difference\nbetween these effects. It follows that there is little or no basis for\nassuming that Z resembles something like\nXs (i.e., human mind or intelligence).\nGod\u2019s nature, therefore, remains altogether \u201cmysterious\nand incomprehensible\u201d from the point of view of human\nunderstanding.\n\nCleanthes responds to this set of objections with a counter-example\nthat is meant to discredit these criticisms and doubts. Suppose we\nheard an articulate voice coming from the clouds and the words uttered\ncontain a message instructing us in a way that is worthy of a great,\nsuperior being. It is not possible, Cleanthes argues, that we would\nhesitate for a moment to ascribe some design or purpose to the cause of this voice\nand conclude that it bears some resemblance to the intelligent source\nof a human voice (D, 3.2\u20133/152\u20133). The situation is not so\ndissimilar as \u201cwhen we hear an articulate voice in the dark and\nthence infer a man\u201d (D, 3.3/152; cp. EU, 4.4/27). According to\nCleanthes, it is similarly perverse and unnatural to deny that the\nvarious parts of the body and the way in which they are suited to our\nenvironment (e.g., legs for walking) are \u201cincontestable proof of\ndesign and intention\u201d (D, 3.8/155; cp. 2.9/144\u20135).\n\nThe fundamental difficulty with Cleanthes\u2019s example is, however,\nthat it suggests a non-traditional, anthropomorphic conception of\nGod\u2019s nature that cannot be overcome other than by arbitrary\nstipulation. Given the nature of the analogy, how are we to understand\nthe nature of God\u2019s mind? Does it have successive, distinct\nthoughts? If so, what sense can we make of God\u2019s simplicity and\nimmutability (D, 4.3/159)? Why should we not assume that God has other\nhuman features such as passions and sentiments, or physical features\nsuch as a mouth or eyes (D, 3.13/156, 5.11/168)? In all cases that we\nhave experience of, human intelligence is embodied, so why not also\nassume that God has a body (D, 6.4\u20135/171\u20132)? What this\nplainly manifests is that the anthropomorphic conception of God, as\ndefended by Cleanthes, reflects an egocentric outlook and delusions\nabout the significance of human life in the universe.\n\nAny experimental reasoning of the kind that the argument from design\nemploys must ensure that the cause is proportioned to the effect. That\nis to say, we cannot \u201cascribe to the cause any qualities, but\nwhat are exactly sufficient to produce them\u201d (EU,\n11.12\u20133/136; D, 5.8/168). If we follow this principle, however,\nwe are no longer in a position to assign several fundamental\nattributes to God. We cannot, for example, attribute any thing\ninfinite to God based on our observation and experience of finite\neffects. Nor can we attribute unity to the original cause of the\nuniverse on the basis of any analogy to human artifacts such as\nhouses; as they are often built by a number of people working\ntogether. Perhaps, therefore, there is more than one God involved in\nthe creation of the universe? More importantly, we are in no position\nto attribute perfection to God unless we observe perfection in his\ncreation. Since there are evidently \u201cmany inexplicable\ndifficulties in the works of nature\u201d we are not justified in\nmaking any inference of this kind (D, 5.6/166\u20137).\n\nThe mistake that Hume particularly warns against, in respect of the\nissue of God\u2019s perfection, is that we cannot begin from the\nassumption that God is perfect, then assume that his creation is\nworthy of him, and then argue, on this basis, that we have evidence\nthat God is perfect.\n\nYou find certain phenomena in nature. You seek a cause or author. You\nimagine that you have found him. You afterwards become so enamored of\nthis offspring of your brain, that you imagine it impossible, but he\nmust produce something greater and more perfect than the present scene\nof things, which is so full of ill and disorder. You forget, that this\nsuperlative intelligence and benevolence are entirely imaginary, or,\nat least, without any foundation in reason; and that you have no\nground to ascribe to him any qualities, but what you see he has\nactually exerted and displayed in his productions. (EU, 11.15/\n137\u20138)\n\n\nThis problem is, of course, most acute when it comes to the\n\u201creality of evil\u201d that we observe in the world. How do we\nvindicate God\u2019s \u201cinfinite power and goodness\u201d when\nwe are faced with overwhelming evidence of (unnecessary and\ninexplicable) evil in the world? What we cannot do, Hume argues, is\nexplain away all evidence of this kind by way of assuming that this\nworld is the perfect creation of a perfect being. It is this\nassumption that needs to be established, so we must not assume it in\nour reasoning.\n\nHume\u2019s aim, in this context, is not to argue that it is\nimpossible that God is perfect but only that we are in no position to\ninfer this unless our experience of this world, which is the sole\nsource of our evidence concerning this issue, is both sufficiently\ncomprehensive and uniformly consistent with the hypothesis. Plainly,\nhowever, it is neither. It follows from this that many other\nhypotheses and conjectures, consistent with the evidence presented,\nmay be considered as no less plausible. Philo puts this point to\nCleanthes:\n\nIn a word, Cleanthes, a man who follows your hypothesis is able,\nperhaps, to assert, or conjecture, that the universe, sometime, arose\nfrom something like design: But beyond that position he cannot\nascertain one single circumstance, and is left afterwards to fix\nevery point of his theology, by the utmost license of fancy and\nhypothesis. (D, 5.12/169 \u2014 our emphasis)\n\n\nPhilo goes on to suggest that, for all we know, this world \u201cis\nvery faulty and imperfect, compared to a superior standard\u201d.\nGiven this, we may also conjecture that this world was created by\n\u201csome infant Deity, who afterwards abandoned it, ashamed of his\nlame performance\u201d or it is \u201cthe production of old age and\ndotage in some superannuated Deity\u201d, and so on (D, 5.12/169).\nThe general point being made is that in the absence of clear evidence\nof perfection in this world we must \u201cproportion the cause to the\neffect\u201d and resist the temptation of \u201cexaggeration and\nflattery to supply the defects of argument and reasoning\u201d (EU,\n11.14/137).\n\nHume\u2019s line of reasoning criticizing the argument from design\npresents theists with a basic and seemingly intractable dilemma in\nrespect of their idea of God. On the one hand, theists such as\nCleanthes want to insist that the analogy between this world and human\nproductions is not so slight and maintains, on this basis, that God in\nsome significant degree resembles human intelligence (D,\n3.7\u20138/154\u20135). The difficulty with this view, as we have\nseen, is that it leads to \u201ca degradation of the supreme\nbeing\u201d by way of an anthropomorphism which from the standpoint\nof traditional theism involves idolatry and is no better than atheism\n(D,2.15/146,3.12\u20133/156, 4.4\u20135/160, 5.11/168). On the other\nhand, if we follow mystics, such as Demea, we end up no better off\nthan sceptics and atheists who claim that we know nothing of\nGod\u2019s nature and attributes and that everything about him is\n\u201cunknown and unintelligible\u201d (D, 4.1/158). Hume\u2019s\nsceptical technique in the Dialogues, therefore, is to play\none group of theists off against the other, showing that both their\npositions end up as nothing better or different from the atheism that\nthey both claim to abhor.\n\nOn the interpretation provided, it is clear that Hume\u2019s critique\nof the argument from design is deep and radical. There are, however,\nseveral passages in the final Part of the Dialogues (XII)\nthat suggest that Philo (Hume) reverses or at least moderates his\nposition \u2014 making some significant concessions to\nCleanthes\u2019s position. The most important evidence of this\nappears in a passage at the beginning of Part XII where Philo says\nthat no one can be so stupid as to reject the view that there are\nsigns of intention and design in this world and that it is evident, as\nCleanthes has argued, \u201cthat the works of nature bear a great\nanalogy to the productions of art\u201d (D, 12.6/216\u20137\n\u2014 my emphasis). Immediately after this, however, Philo proceeds\nto reverse his reversal (i.e., he performs a double-reversal). He\ninsists, in particular, on the verbal or trivial nature of the whole\ndispute about whether we should call God a \u201cmind\u201d or\n\u201cintelligence\u201d and emphasizes, once again, \u201cthe\nvast difference, which may reasonably be supposed between him\nand human minds\u201d (D, 12.6/216\u20137 \u2014 my emphasis). In\nan especially important passage, which was inserted into the\nDialogues shortly before Hume died, Philo elaborates on his\nview. The truly pious, he argues, will acknowledge \u201cthat there\nis a great and immeasurable, because\nincomprehensible, difference between the human and the\ndivine mind\u201d (D, 12.7/218 \u2014 my emphasis). On the\nother hand, the atheist may allow that there is some \u201cremote\nanalogy\u201d among the various operations of nature, including\n\u201cthe rotting of a turnip, the generation of an animal, and the\nstructure of human thought\u201d (D, 12.7/218). In other words, the\natheist can concede that there is some remote analogy between the\nfirst principle of the universe and several other parts of\nnature\u2014only one of which is human thought and mind (D, 12.7/218;\nand cp. 7.1/176\u20137). Hume\u2019s point is that there are other\nanalogies that are no less plausible than that which Cleanthes has\nsuggested. These other analogies do not suggest that the cause of this\nworld is something like mind or human intelligence. Clearly, then, the\natheist may concede that there is some remote analogy between God and\nhuman minds and still insist that there remain other analogies and\nhypotheses that are no less plausible. The conclusion to be drawn from\nthis is that all such analogies are so weak and \u201cremote\u201d\nthat God\u2019s nature remains an \u201cinexplicable mystery\u201d\nwell beyond the scope of human understanding (D, 12.33/227; cp. NHR,\n15.13).\n\nHume never retreats from the view stated in the first Enquiry\nthat God (i.e., the cause of the world) is \u201ca Being, so remote\nand incomprehensible, who bears much less analogy to any other being\nin the universe than the sun to a waxen taper, and who discovers\nhimself only by some faint traces or outlines, beyond which we have no\nauthority to ascribe to him any attribute or perfection\u201d (EU,\n11.27/146). This position is indistinguishable from the scepticism\nthat Hume\u2019s contemporaries associated with Hobbes\u2019s\nperceived atheism. \n5. The Problem of Evil\n\nThe arguments of Hume\u2019s that we have considered so far may all\nbe described as sceptical arguments that are critical of efforts to\nprove the existence of God. No argument considered so far aims to\nprove that God does not or cannot exist. However, in the\nDialogues Hume considers an ancient argument based on the\nexistence of evil that is intended to establish this negative\nconclusion. It comes in the form of \u201cEpicurus\u2019s old\nquestions\u201d which remain \u201cunanswered\u201d (D, 10.25/198).\nThe questions are these: Is God willing to prevent evil but unable to\ndo so? Then he is not omnipotent. Is God able to prevent evil but\nunwilling to do so? Then he is malevolent (or at least less than\nperfectly good). If God is both willing and able to prevent evil then\nwhy is there evil in the world? (See the entry on the\n problem of evil.)\n What is at stake here is the possibility of vindicating God\u2019s\nmoral attributes in face of the existence of evil in this world. It is\nclear, as Cleanthes acknowledges, that if this cannot be done then the\ncase for theism in any traditional form will collapse (D,\n10.28/199).\n\nSeveral different strategies are available to the theist to defuse\nthis problem \u2014 that is, theodicies of various kinds. One\nstrategy is to deny the reality of evil and insist that the evils we\nexperience or observe in the world are really \u201cgoods to the\nuniverse\u201d which are essential for a perfectly good whole. In\nother words, these are only evils relative to our individual, narrow,\nhuman perspective. From the divine perspective, viewing the universe\nas one system, the removal of such ills or afflictions would produce\ngreater ill or diminish the total amount of good in the world. This\nstrategy may be interpreted as arguing either that there are no real\nevils in the world (i.e., only apparent evils) or that there are real\nevils in the world but they are all necessary evils \u2014 without\nwhich the whole system of nature would not be so perfect (Cp. D,\n10.5\u20137/194; EU, 8.34/101).\n\nIn respect of the first view, that there is no real evil, Hume takes\nthe view that it is plainly contrary to human experience. The reality\nof the distinction between good and evil \u2014 whether physical or\nmoral \u2014 depends on \u201cthe natural sentiments of the human\nmind\u201d. These distinctions, based on feeling, cannot be altered\nor amended \u201cby any philosophical theory or speculation\nwhatsoever\u201d (EU, 8.34\u20135/101\u201303). In the\nDialogues Hume opens his discussion of the problem of evil by\nhaving Philo (the sceptic) run through a long catalogue of the variety\nand extent of misery and suffering in this world. He begins with\nanimal suffering of various kinds (the strong preying on the weak\netc.) and moves on to human suffering in its numerous forms (illness,\nemotional torments, war etc.). Even religion (i.e.,\n\u201csuperstition\u201d) is a source of fear and anxiety. Despite\nthis catalogue of human suffering and grief, we find ourselves too\nafraid of death to put an end to our miserable existence. \u201cWe\nare terrified, not bribed to the continuance of our existence.\u201d\n(D, 10.17/197) The conclusion that Philo draws from all this is that\n\u201cthe course of nature tends not to human or animal\nfelicity\u201d \u2013which brings us back to \u201cEpicurus\u2019s\nold questions\u201d (D, 10.25/198).\n\nThe first line of reply to this comes from Demea (the mystic) who\nargues that \u201cthe present evil phenomena \u2026 are rectified\nin other regions, and in some future period of existence\u201d (D,\n10.29/199). This is a view that is immediately corrected by Cleanthes\nalong similar lines to those that Hume also presents in the first\nEnquiry. The problem here is that if we grant, with Demea,\nthe reality of evil in this world then in so far as our understanding\nof God\u2019s attributes is based on the evidence of his creation in\nthis world, we are in no position to infer the \u201cperfect goodness\nof the Deity\u201d.\n\nNow without some such license of supposition, it is impossible for us\nto argue from the cause, or infer any alteration in the effect, beyond\nwhat has immediately fallen under our observation. Greater good\nproduced by this Being must still prove a greater degree of goodness:\na more impartial distribution of rewards and punishments must proceed\nfrom a greater regard to justice and equity. Every supposed addition\nto the works of nature makes an addition to the attributes of the\nAuthor of nature; and consequently, being entirely unsupported by any\nreason or argument, can never be admitted but as a mere conjecture and\nhypothesis. (EU, 11.26/ 145)\n\n\nHume\u2019s point is not that the reality of evil proves that God\ncannot be both omnipotent and perfectly good but that we are in no\nposition to claim that we know that God will \u201crectify\u201d the\nevil of this world (e.g., its unjust distribution of good and evil) in\na future state, since the evidence of this world does not support such\na conjecture. Our predicament is like that of a person who stands in\nthe porch that leads into a very different building or structure and\nmust conjecture what the complete or whole plan is like. We may hope\nor imagine that something better awaits us but the present phenomena\ndo not license a conjecture or hypothesis of this kind (EU, 11.21,24/\n141,143).\n\nFaced with this difficulty, Cleanthes insists that contrary to all\nthat Philo and Demea have claimed, we must allow that there is more\nhappiness than misery, more pleasure than pain, in this world. Failing\nthis, \u201cthere is an end at once of all religion\u201d (D,\n10.28/199). Philo\u2019s response is that this is a fatal concession.\nNot only will it be hard to prove that there is more happiness than\nmisery in the world, much more than this is needed to vindicate\nGod\u2019s moral attributes. Unless all evil is essential or\nnecessary the religious position will collapse. Any degree or kind of\nunnecessary evil \u2014 however small \u2014 would tell against the\nexistence of God as an infinitely powerful and perfectly good being.\nThe usual reply to this (echoing God\u2019s answer to Job) is that we\nhumans are in no position to tell whether there is any unnecessary\nevil in this world \u2013for all we know, all the evil in this world\nis indeed necessary evil. It is arrogance to question God\u2019s\nexistence and goodness when we lack understanding of the infinite\ncomplexities of his creation.\n\nThe central thrust of Hume\u2019s discussion of evil in the\nDialogues is to show that this kind of theodicy fails.\n\nI will allow, that pain or misery in man is compatible with\ninfinite power and goodness in the Deity, even in your sense of these\nattributes: What have you advanced by all these concessions? A mere\npossible compatibility is not sufficient. You must prove these pure\nunmixed, and uncontrollable attributes from the present mixed and\nconfused phenomena, and from these alone. (D,10.35/201)\n\n\nPhilo goes on to point out that even if the phenomena of nature were\n\u201cpure and unmixed\u201d (i.e., entirely good) they are still\nfinite and so insufficient to prove God\u2019s infinite perfection\nand goodness. The phenomena of nature are, in any case, not only\nfinite, they are a mixture of good and evil, so any effort to prove\nGod\u2019s \u201cinfinite power and goodness\u201d on this basis is\na hopeless task. Here Philo claims to \u201ctriumph\u201d (D,\n10.36/201). Further on, Philo returns to this point.\n\n\u2026 as this goodness is not antecedently established, but must be\ninferred from the phenomena, there can be no grounds for such an\ninference, while there are so many ills in the universe, and while\nthese ills might so easily have been remedied, as far as human\nunderstanding can be allowed to judge on such a subject. I am sceptic\nenough to allow, that the bad appearances, notwithstanding all my\nreasonings, may be compatible with such attributes as you suppose: But\nsurely they can never prove these attributes. (D, 11.12/211)\n\n\nClearly, then, the task required of traditional theism cannot be to\nestablish merely the possibility that the existence of evil is\nconsistent with God\u2019s existence, it is to explain how we can\ninfer God\u2019s infinite power and goodness on the basis of our\nexperience of finite phenomena that presents us with a mixture of good\nand evil in this world. It is this task, Philo maintains, that\nCleanthes has failed to perform.\n\nThe subtlety of Hume\u2019s argument is now clear. There is no need\nfor the sceptic to launch a strong argument that aims to prove that\nGod cannot exist on the basis of the real existence of evil in this\nworld. All that the sceptic needs to do is to show that the theist is\nunable to prove or establish God\u2019s attributes of infinite power\nand goodness given the evidence of creation as we observe it. What the\ntheist must do, in order to meet this challenge, is to show that all\nthe evil that exists in this world (i.e., every last degree and\nmeasure of it) is necessary and unavoidable. It is clear that the\ntheist is in no position to support this claim. The mere possibility\nthat this is the case will not suffice to justify the inference to\nGod\u2019s infinite power and goodness. We cannot, therefore,\nestablish God\u2019s moral attributes along the lines that Cleanthes\nhas suggested.\n\nHume\u2019s \u201cconcession\u201d that evil and God\u2019s\nexistence are compatible may have the appearance of (another)\n\u201cretreat\u201d from a stronger sceptical position. The\nsignificance of this concession should not be exaggerated. While the\nsceptic cannot prove that there does indeed exist some unnecessary\nevil in the world, it is nevertheless possible to show that this view\nof things is in no way unreasonable. Hume describes a fourfold\ncatalogue of causes of evil in this world none of which \u201cappear\nto human reason, in the least degree, necessary or unavoidable\u201d\n(D, 11.5/205). He asks, for example, why animal creation is not\nanimated entirely by pleasure, as it appears \u201cplainly possible\nto carry on the business of life without any pain\u201d (D,\n11.6/206). Similarly, why could God not have been more generous in\nproviding his creatures with better endowments for their survival and\nhappiness (i.e., why is God not more of an \u201cindulgent\nparent\u201d)? (D, 11.9/208) Again, why does nature run into such\nextremes in relation to heat and cold, rains, winds, and so on? Surely\nthings could have been arranged so that these extremes and their\ndestructive consequences could be avoided? Finally, Hume asks why God\ndoes not act through particular volitions to prevent specific\ncatastrophes and disasters (e.g., why not ensure there is no storm\nblowing when a fleet is out at sea)? (D,11.8/206) In all these cases,\nHume grants, there may \u201cbe good reasons, why providence\ninterposes not in this manner; but they are unknown to us\u201d (D,\n11.8/207). The implication of all this is not just that we have no\nreason to infer the existence of an infinitely powerful and good God\nbut that we have considerable reason for doubting it.\n\nGiven these considerations regarding the causes of evil, and the\nlimits of human understanding, what is the most reasonable hypothesis\nconcerning the first cause of the universe? Philo dismisses the\nsuggestion that the first cause is either perfectly good or perfectly\nmalevolent on the ground that \u201cmixed phenomena\u201d can never\nprove either of the unmixed principles as the first cause. This leaves\nonly two other possibilities. Either the first cause has both goodness\nand malice or it has neither. Philo argues that the steady and orderly\nnature of the world suggests that no such (Manichean)\n\u201ccombat\u201d between good and evil is going on. So the most\nplausible hypothesis is that \u201cthe original source of all\nthings\u201d is just as indifferent about \u201cgood above\nill\u201d as it is about heat above cold (D, 11.14/211\u20132).\nNature is blind and uncaring regarding such matters and there is no\nbasis for the supposition that the world has been created with human\nor animal happiness or comfort in mind. Any supposition of this kind\nis nothing better than an anthropomorphic prejudice (EU, 11.27/146;\ncp. D, 10.31/200).\n\nThe tendency of Hume\u2019s discussion of evil, in both the\nEnquiry and Dialogues, is to insist on the reality\nof evil and the doubts that this casts on any claim that the beauty,\nharmony and order of this world provides us with clear evidence that\nan infinitely powerful and good being created and governs it. As we\nhave noted, Hume\u2019s argument falls short of categorically denying\nthat God exists on the ground that there is unnecessary evil in this\nworld. What Hume\u2019s arguments do show, however, is that while it\nis possible that the reality of evil is consistent with the existence\nof God this leaves theism with a large and significant problem that\nremains unanswered. The enormous degree of evil in this world, and the\nvast range of forms that it takes, are impossible to explain or\njustify from our human perspective (i.e., given the limits of human\nunderstanding). There is, therefore, no basis for inferring the\nexistence of an infinitely powerful and good God in face of contrary\nevidence of this kind \u2014 evidence that provides us with\nconsiderable grounds for doubting this conjecture or hypothesis.\n6. Miracles\n\nMiracles are an essential and fundamental element of the major\nmonotheistic religions (i.e., Judaism, Christianity, Islam). The\naccounts of\n miracles,\n as presented in scripture and elsewhere, are supposed to confirm the\nauthenticity and authority of scripture and the prophets and, more\nimportantly, establish that God has revealed himself to human beings\nthrough these special acts or events. From the point of view of\nChristianity, one miracle of particular significance is the\nresurrection of Jesus Christ. To doubt or question the truth of this\nevent is to doubt the core and distinct meaning and doctrine of the\nChristian religion. It would be to cast doubt on the claim that Christ\nis God and the saviour of human kind. A major concern of Hume\u2019s,\nespecially as presented in Section X of the first Enquiry,\nwas to discredit miracle claims of this kind \u2014 a concern Hume\nshared with many other religious critics of his day (see Burns\n1981).\n\nAccording to Hume\u2019s account, \u201ca miracle is a violation of\na law of nature\u201d (EU, 11.12/114). More specifically, it is\n\u201ca transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of\nthe Deity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent\u201d (EU,\n11.12n/115n). As defined, a miracle may occur without any person\nobserving it (i.e., it may be completely unknown). Hume\u2019s\nadditional proviso that a miracle is not only a violation of a law of\nnature but also requires the direct activity of God (or some\n\u201cinvisible agent\u201d) is a significant qualification. It\nfollows from this that we cannot establish that a miracle has occurred\nby showing only that the laws of nature have been violated, as this\nmay only be a chance or capricious event (EU, 8.25/96; cp. T,\n1.3.13.33/171). Nevertheless, the key issue, for Hume\u2019s critique\nof miracles, is whether or not we ever have reason to believe on the\nbasis of testimony that a law of nature has been violated.\nHume\u2019s arguments lead to the conclusion that we never have\nreason to believe miracle reports as passed on to us.\n\nA law of nature, as Hume interprets it, involves a uniform regularity\nof events. We discover laws of nature on the basis of our experience\nof constant conjunctions of events or objects. An obvious example of\nthis, provided by Hume, is that \u201call men must die\u201d (EU,\n11.12/114). It would, therefore, be \u201ca miracle, that a dead man\nshould come to life\u201d because we have \u201cuniform\nexperience\u201d that tells against such a claim (EU, 11.12/ 115).\nWhen we have uniform experience that confirms the existence of\nregularities of this kind we have, says Hume, \u201ca direct and full\nproof, from the nature of the fact, against the existence of the\nmiracle\u201d (EU, 11.12/115). The point that Hume is concerned to\nmake here is that the \u201cultimate standard\u201d by which we must\njudge whether a miracle has occurred is (much) higher than it is in\nthe case of other reports claiming to establish some unusual or\nunexpected event. It is, for example, no miracle that a man in good\nhealth should suddenly die. Although an event of this kind may be\nimprobable, it does sometimes occur. In the case of miracles, however,\nwe are asked to believe something that is contrary to all other\nexperience and observation (e.g., resurrection from the dead).\nMiracles must be unique (or nearly unique) events otherwise they fall\nwithin the \u201ccommon course of nature\u201d, no matter how rare\nand unusual the event may be.\n\nGiven this account of miracles, understood as violations of laws of\nnature, how should we evaluate claims that miracles have occurred? The\nprinciple that Hume relies on, for this purpose, is that a reasonable\nperson \u201cproportions his belief to the evidence\u201d (EU,\n11.4/110). In the case of miracles, the relevant evidence that we need\nto weigh comes from two distinct sources that must be balanced against\neach other. On one side, there is the question of the credibility of\nthe witnesses to the event. That is to say, we need to ask if we can\nrely on the truthfulness and judgment of the individual(s) who report\nthat the relevant event took place. On the other side, there is the\nquestion of the credibility of the fact itself (i.e., that a violation\nof a law of nature occurred). Clearly, in circumstances where there is\nsome opposition between these two sets of considerations, the\nreasonable person will believe that which has the superior evidence in\nits support.\n\nIf we follow this procedure, Hume claims, we must conclude that\n\u201cno testimony for any kind of a miracle has ever amounted to a\nprobability, much less to a proof; and that, even supposing it\namounted to a proof, it would be opposed by another\nproof\u2026.\u201d (EU, 11.35/ 127). Hume establishes this general\npoint in two related moves. The evidence telling against the\noccurrence of a miracle must always constitute a full proof \u2014\nsince we have uniform human experience in support of the laws of\nnature (EU, 11.12/115). It follows from this:\n\nThat no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the\ntestimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more\nmiraculous, than the fact, which it endeavours to establish; and even\nin that case there is a mutual destruction of arguments\u2026 (EU,\n11.13 / 116)\n\n\nThe only basis for giving any credibility to miracle reports \u2013\nsince by their nature they are wholly unlikely \u2014 is to give\nweight and credibility to the character and authority of the witnesses\nto the event(s). However, even in the optimal case, where the\ncredibility of the witnesses and their reports are judged to be beyond\ndoubt and wholly reliable, we are faced with evidence that is equally\nopposed \u2014 \u201cproof against proof\u201d.\n\nHume\u2019s argument, up to this point, supposes that the testimony\nin support of a miracle \u201camounts to an entire proof\u201d and\nis wholly reliable. However, the fact is, Hume argues, that this\nconcession is \u201ca great deal too liberal\u201d. If we consider\nthe specific circumstances and conditions in which miracle reports\ngenerally occur, and the sources they come from, Hume believes we will\nhave to conclude that testimony in support of actual historical\nmiracles, of the kind that the major religions rely on, are far from\nreliable. The relevant standards by which we judge the reliability of\ntestimony (i.e. in ordinary life \u2014 including law and history, as\nwell as religion) involve several different considerations. Hume\nmentions four categories of consideration about the reliability of\ntestimony. Each of them is such that the credibility of the testimony\nmay be diminished when we give due weight to these factors.\n\nThe first category concerns the witnesses to the event. Obviously the\ncredibility of an event increases when more witnesses attest to it. We\nalso need to know about the character and competence of the\nwitness(es). If they are educated, sensible and critical we will more\nreadily believe them than if they are ignorant and gullible. A second\ncategory of consideration that Hume mentions is that there is a\ngeneral psychological weakness in human nature whereby we want to\nbelieve in events that produce feelings of surprise and wonder because\nthese are \u201cagreeable emotions\u201d (EU, 11.16/117).\n\nAs belief is almost absolutely requisite to the exciting our passions,\nso the passions in their turn are very favourable to belief\u2026\nAdmiration and surprise have the same effect as the other passions;\nand accordingly we may observe, that among the vulgar, quacks and\nprojectors meet with a more easy faith upon account of their\nmagnificent pretensions, than if they kept themselves within the\nbounds of moderation. The first astonishment, which naturally attends\ntheir miraculous relations, spreads itself over the whole soul, and so\nvivifies and enlivens the idea that it resembles the inferences we\ndraw from experience. (T, 1.3.10.4 / 120)\n\n\nThis natural disposition leads to credulity and \u201csubdues the\nunderstanding\u201d (EU, 11.17/ 117\u20138; T, 1.3.9.12 / 113).\n\u201cLove of wonder\u201d is often joined with \u201cthe spirit of\nreligion\u201d whereby the religionist, \u201cwith the best\nintentions in the world, for the sake of promoting so holy a\ncause\u201d, is more powerfully drawn to belief (EU, 11.17 /\n117\u20138). Hume also notes that lies have been told in all ages and\nthat the frequent repetition of lies promotes belief (T, 1.3.9.19 /\n117; cp. T, 1.3.5.6 / 86). More generally, custom and education\ninfluence belief and in many cases \u201ctake such deep root that\n\u2018tis impossible for us, by all the powers of reason and\nexperience to eradicate them\u201d (T, 1.3.9.17 / 116). The third\nrange of factors Hume mentions are the variable historical and social\nconditions that affect credulity. Although there is a universal\npropensity to credulity, Hume notes that miraculous and supernatural\nevents \u201care observed chiefly to abound among ignorant and\nbarbarous nations\u201d (EU, 11.20 / 119). Finally, the authority of\nmiracle reports is diminished by the consideration that the miracle\nreports coming from rival religions tend to diminish the authority and\ncredibility of all of them (EU, 11.24 / 121\u20132). The result of\ngiving weight to these various considerations is that the credulity of\nactual historical miracle claims is radically diminished. Hume\nbelieves that there is no probability left in support of them.\n\nHume\u2019s views on miracles have been criticized from a variety of\nperspectives. Some critics have claimed that Hume, in laying down that\nmiracles run up against uniform experience, is simply assuming at the\noutset that the probability of miracle occurrences is equal to zero\n(see Johnson 1999 and Earman 2003). In response to this is has been\npointed out that Hume\u2019s concern is not with the factual question\nas to whether miracles have occurred or not, but with the epistemic\nquestion of whether it can be rational to believe miracle reports\n(see, e.g., Fogelin 2003). An even more problematic line of criticism\nconsists in claiming that Hume denies the very possibility of miracles\noccurring. As it stands, this misrepresents his view. According to\nHume, miracles are entirely possible in the sense that there is no\nabsurdity or contradiction involved in suggesting that the laws of\nnature are violated \u2014 this is at least conceivable. Nor does\nHume deny that rare, unusual, surprising and wonderous events do\nactually occur. There may even be circumstances when extraordinary\nevents of this kind may be justifiably believed on the basis of\ntestimony (EU, 11.36 /127\u20138). Moreover, Hume also recognizes\nthat events frequently occur that are unexpected and which we do not\nknow the cause(s) of (EU, 8.12\u20134 / 86\u20137). None of these\nconsiderations, however, show that the laws of nature have actually\nbeen violated. On the contrary, our experience shows that when\n\u201cirregular and extraordinary\u201d events do occur a closer\nexamination and investigation generally uncovers the relevant\n\u201chidden\u201d or \u201cconcealed\u201d causes that were at\nwork. Only the ignorant and vulgar conclude, in circumstances of this\nkind, that the laws of nature have been violated or that a miracle has\noccurred. It is in this sense that Hume maintains that miracles do not\noccur. In this way, the evidence of experience shows us, Hume\nsuggests, that nature is uniform and regular. When this appears not to\nbe so, subsequent experience and closer investigation reveals that\nthis is a sign only of human ignorance and credulity, not of any\n(incomprehensible) divine activity.\n\nWhat really matters for assessing Hume\u2019s critique of miracles is\nto keep in mind that his primary aim is to discredit the actual\nhistorical miracle claims that are supposed to provide authority and\ncredibility for the major established religions \u2014 most\nobviously, Christianity. From this perspective, the central issue is\nnot whether Hume is right in claiming that it is impossible for any\nmiracle claim to be established as morally certain (i.e.,\n\u201cproved\u201d), but if he is right in claiming that the\nhistorical miracle claims supporting the major religions such as\nChristianity pass this standard. It is Hume\u2019s judgment that when\nwe weigh the relevant evidence, and proportion our belief accordingly,\nwe will find that these claims are rationally unbelievable.\n7. Immortality and a Future State\n\nAccording to Joseph Butler, an influential contemporary of\nHume\u2019s, the most important question that can possibly be asked\nis whether we are to live in a future state. It was Butler\u2019s\nview that the doctrine of future rewards and punishments is\nfundamental to religion and essential for its practical influence over\nhuman life and conduct. This view of the importance of the doctrine of\nfuture rewards and punishments was accepted by almost all the leading\ntheologians at this time (and is, of course, still widely accepted\namong religious thinkers today). It is evident that the immortality of\nthe soul is an essential part of this doctrine. For Hume\u2019s\ncontemporaries, proofs of the immortality of the soul generally\ndepended upon showing that the soul is immaterial.\n\nThere are two \u201cmetaphysical\u201d arguments that aim to\nestablish the immateriality of the soul that Hume is especially\nconcerned with. The first argument, which is Platonic in origin,\nmaintains that whereas mind is simple, unitary and indivisible, matter\nis compounded and infinitely divisible. It follows from this,\naccording to this argument, that mind is distinct from matter and that\nonly an immaterial being or substance is capable of thought and\nconsciousness. Moreover, since immaterial minds are simple and\nindivisible they are incapable of destruction and continue to exist\neternally (unless annihilated by divine power). A second and related\nargument is that it is impossible for matter and motion to produce\nthought and consciousness. For this to be possible we must suppose\nthat a cause can produce effects that possess perfections that it\nlacks. Once again, this would be to suppose that something could be\nproduced by nothing, which is absurd and contradictory.\n\nHume rejects both these metaphysical arguments for the immateriality\nand immortality of the soul. His refutations are presented, first, in\nthe Treatise 1.4.5\u20136 and, later and more briefly, in\nhis essay \u201cOf the Immortality of the Soul\u201d. (It is\npossible that this essay contains material that was originally\nintended for publication in the Treatise but was withdrawn.)\nRegarding the suggestion that thought and consciousness must belong to\nor inhere in an immaterial substance, Hume objects that we have no\nidea of either immaterial or material substance.\n\nBut just as metaphysics teach us, that the notion of substance is\nwholly confused and imperfect, and that we have no other idea of any\nsubstance than as an aggregate of particular qualities, inhering in an\nunknown something. Matter, therefore, and spirit are at bottom equally\nunknown; and we cannot determine what qualities may inhere in the one\nor in the other. (ESY, 591)\n\n\nThe important and intelligible issue, according to Hume, is not the\nquestion of the substance of thought but that concerning the cause of\nour perceptions (T, 1.4.5.29/ 246f). In respect of this issue, Hume\ninvokes his general causal maxim that \u201cany thing may produce any\nthing\u201d in order to establish that a priori it is possible that\nmatter may be the cause of thought (T, 1.4.5.30 / 247). Furthermore,\nexperience shows us, Hume maintains, that there do exist constant\nconjunctions between matter and motion, on one side, and thought and\nconsciousness on the other. Clearly, then, in so far as we have any\nidea of causation as it exists in the world, we must conclude that\nthought and consciousness can indeed arise from matter and motion (as\nthe materialists maintain). In his essay on \u201cImmortality\u201d\nHume expands on these points to argue that the evidence of experience\nshows us that thought and consciousness depends on our bodily\nexistence and, therefore, bodily death must imply death of the mind as\nwell (ESY, 596; cp. D, 6.5/171).\n\nApart from Hume\u2019s sceptical arguments directed against the\nimmateriality and immortality of the soul, he also advances sceptical\narguments concerning the doctrine of future rewards and punishments.\nIn the context of Section XI of the first Enquiry, as we have\nalready noted, Hume argues that we have no adequate evidence,\n\u201cderived from the present phenomena\u201d of this world, that a\nfuture state will correct the injustices of this world. Hume presents\nthe \u201creligionist\u201d with the following difficulty:\n\nAre there any marks of a distributive justice in this world? If you\nanswer in the affirmative, I conclude that, since justice here exerts\nitself, it is satisfied. If you reply in the negative, I conclude,\nthat you have then no reason to ascribe justice, in our sense of it,\nto the gods. If you hold a medium between affirmation and negation, by\nsaying, that the justice of the gods, at present, exerts itself in\npart but not to its full extent; I answer, that you have no reason to\ngive it any particular extent, but only so far as you see it, at\npresent, exert itself. (EU, 11.22 / 141\u20132 \u2014\nHume\u2019s emphasis)\n\n\nIn the Treatise Hume advanced another set of arguments\nagainst the doctrine of a future state. In this context he argues that\nany idea or belief in life in a future state is too faint and weak to\nhave any practical influence over our passions and conduct.\n\nA future state is so far remov\u2019d from our comprehension, and we\nhave so obscure an idea of the manner, in which we shall exist after\nthe dissolution of the body, that all the reasons we can invent,\nhowever strong in themselves, and however much assisted by education,\nare never able with slow imaginations to surmount this difficulty, or\nbestow a sufficient authority and force on the idea. (T, 1.3.9.13 /\n114)\n\n\nIn general, says Hume, the lack of resemblance between this life and a\nfuture state destroys belief and, consequently, has little influence\non our passions and conduct. Hume claims \u201cthere scarce are any,\nwho believe the immortality of the soul with a true and established\njudgment\u201d (T, 1.3.9.14 / 114\u20135). The evidence for this is\nthat our conduct is usually guided with a view to the pleasures and\npains, rewards and punishments, of this life and not a future state\n(T, 1.3.9.14 / 115; cp. D, 12.13/220\u201301).\n\nHume adds a further set of objections relating to the morally\npernicious aspects of the doctrine of a future state of rewards and\npunishments. Among the several arguments that he puts forward on this\nscore, four points are especially important. In the first place, Hume\nasks, what is the point or purpose of punishment in a future state? In\nthis life we assume that punishment must not only be deserved, it must\nalso achieve some relevant social end or value (e.g., contribute to\nthe stability and peace of society). When we are removed from this\nworld these goals are taken away and punishment becomes pointlessly\nretributive (ESY, 594). The implication of this is that punishment\nwithout any further point or purpose is mere vengeance that lacks any\nproper justification. Second, Hume asks on what basis God determines\nthe extent of our merit and demerit. Among human beings the standard\nof merit and demerit depends on our moral sentiments and our sense of\npleasure and pain. Are we to suppose that God also has human passions\nand feelings of this kind? (ESY, 594,595; cp. LET, I, 40 [#16]; D,\n3.13/156) Third, the doctrine of eternal damnation clearly involves\nexcessive punishment \u2014 even for the worst of crimes. Finally,\nthe split between Heaven and Hell supposes \u201ctwo distinct species\nof men, the good and the bad. But the greatest part of mankind float\nbetween vice and virtue.\u201d (ESY, 594)\n\nHume\u2019s position on the doctrine of a future state is clear. From\nevery point of view this doctrine is considered unsound. It depends on\nmetaphysical assumptions about the nature of mind (soul) that are\nphilosophically unconvincing, involving obscure ideas that are plainly\nat odds with our everyday experience and observations concerning the\nrelationship between mind and body. It also depends on assumptions\nabout God\u2019s goodness and justice that lack any adequate\nphilosophical justification. Moreover, because the ideas and arguments\ninvolved in this doctrine are considered by Hume to be obscure and\nunconvincing, we find, in practice, that the doctrine has little or no\ninfluence in directing human conduct. Finally, not only is this\ndoctrine considered by Hume to be philosophically flawed and\npsychologically feeble, it depends on moral principles that are both\nunjust and corrupting.\n8. Hume\u2019s Genealogy of Religion: Causes and Dynamics of Religious Belief\n\nIn 1757 Hume published \u201cThe Natural History of\nReligion\u201d, a work that proposes to identify and explain the\norigins and evolution of religious belief. This project follows lines\nof investigation and criticism that had already been laid down by a\nnumber of other thinkers, including Lucretius, Hobbes and Spinoza.\nHume\u2019s primary objective in this work is to show that the\norigins and foundations of religious belief do not rest with reason or\nphilosophical arguments of any kind but with aspects of human nature\nthat reflect our weaknesses, vulnerabilities and limitations (i.e.,\nfear and ignorance). Related to this point, Hume also wants to show\nthat the basic forces in human nature and psychology that shape and\nstructure religious belief are in conflict with each other and that,\nas a result of this, religious belief is inherently unstable and\nvariable. In arguing for these points, Hume is directly challenging an\nopposing view, one that was widely held among his own orthodox\ncontemporaries. According to this view (e.g., as presented by\nCleanthes), the evidence of God\u2019s existence is so obvious that\nno one sincerely and honestly doubts it. Belief in an intelligent,\ninvisible creator and governor of the world is a universal belief\nrooted in and supported by reason. From this perspective, no person\nsincerely accepts \u201cspeculative atheism\u201d. Hume\u2019s\n\u201cnaturalistic\u201d approach to religion aims to discredit\nthese claims and assumptions of theism.\n\nAccording to Hume, all that the various religions in the world have in\ncommon is belief that there is an invisible, intelligent power in the\nworld (NHR, Intro, 4.1). Although there is a \u201cuniversal\npropensity to believe in invisible, intelligent power\u201d (NHR,\n15.5), even religious belief of this limited kind is not entirely\nuniversal or any sort of \u201coriginal instinct\u201d. Hume also\npoints out that religion of this most general kind is not to be\nconfused with \u201cgenuine theism\u201d. Genuine theism involves a\nmore specific set of beliefs: that there is only one god and that god\nis the invisible, intelligent creator and governor of the world (NHR,\n4.2). In several different contexts in The Natural History of\nReligion Hume suggests that the argument from design \u2014\nbased on our observation of beauty and order in the world \u2014 is a\nconvincing and plausible basis for genuine theism (NHR, Intro, 6.1,\n15.1). However, despite this veil of orthodoxy, his objective\nthroughout this work is to show that the actual foundation of genuine\ntheism, as we find it in the world, does not rest with reasoning or\narguments of any kind. The true roots of genuine theism can be\ndiscovered in the psychological dynamics that first give rise to\npolytheism. The same (irrational) forces that shape polytheism serve\nto explain the rise of theism and the instability and variations that\nwe discover within it.\n\nHume maintains that \u201cpolytheism or idolatry was, and must have\nbeen, the first and most ancient religion of mankind\u201d (NHR,\n1.1). Not only does the evidence of history make this clear (Hume\ndiscounts the historical reliability of the Hebrew Bible, which, as is\nwell-known, presents a different picture), we know as well that if\ntheism, based on the (obvious and convincing) argument of design, were\nthe original religion then it would be impossible to explain how\npolytheism could have ever arisen out of it. That is to say, the\nargument from design would continue to have the same force and so we\nshould not expect any deviation from it. What, then, is the origin of\npolytheism? The basis of polytheism is not the beauty and order we\ndiscover in the works of nature, as that leads us to genuine theism,\nit is rather \u201cthe various and contrary events of human\nlife\u201d. These are events (e.g., weather, illness, wars, etc.)\nthat are unpredictable but important to us because they directly\ninfluence human happiness and misery. In respect of these events,\nwhich engage our deepest hopes and fears, we are generally ignorant of\nthe causes that are involved in producing them \u2014 especially when\nhuman beings are in a more primitive and backward state of society. In\nthese circumstances, the \u201cignorant multitude\u201d conceives of\nthese unknown causes as depending on invisible, intelligent agents who\nthey may influence by means of prayers and sacrifice. By this means,\nhuman beings hope to control what they do not understand and are\nafraid of. As a result of this process, as shaped by human fears and\nignorance, the world becomes populated with human-like invisible,\nintelligent powers that are objects of worship.\n\nThe religion of polytheism is very different from genuine theism in so\nfar as it does not concern itself with the (abstract and speculative)\nquestion concerning the origin or supreme government of the universe.\nThese are questions that primitive people who are struggling for their\ndaily survival do not have time to speculate about. To this extent,\ntherefore, polytheists and idolaters may be regarded as\n\u201csuperstitious atheists\u201d, as they plainly have no idea of\na being that corresponds to our idea of God (NHR, 4.2). From their\nperspective, however, genuine theists are guilty of atheism, since\nthey deny the existence of the \u201csubordinate deities\u201d that\npolytheists worship (NHR, 4.10n27). The clear implication of these\nobservations is that the notion of \u201catheism\u201d \u2014 along\nwith its negative connotations \u2013 is entirely relative to a\nparticular religion and its particular conception of god or gods.\n\nThe question that Hume now turns to is how theism arose from\npolytheism. In respect of this issue, Hume observes that there are two\nconflicting tendencies in human nature.\n\nAnd thus, however strong men\u2019s propensity to believe invisible,\nintelligent power in nature, their propensity is equally strong to\nrest their attention on sensible, visible objects; and in order to\nreconcile these opposite inclinations, they are led to unite the\ninvisible power with some visible object. (NHR, 5.2)\n\n\nThese conflicting demands are best satisfied by representing the\nvarious gods as something like ourselves and attributing particular\nqualities and attributes to them that are relevant to their specific\nsphere of influence (e.g., the god of war is cruel and ferocious\netc.). Over time, among the vulgar, one of these gods will gradually\nemerge as a particular object of veneration and worship. In their\nanxiety to please and praise this god, worshippers will continually\ntry to outdo their predecessors by attributing greater and greater\npowers and perfections to him. At last they will reach a point where\nthey represent this god as infinite and entirely perfect, whereby they\nrender his nature inexplicable and mysterious. The irony about this,\nHume wryly observes, is that the vulgar arrive at a more\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d conception of God by way of a process that\nis shaped by principles that are entirely unguided by reason.\n\nAt this stage, Hume\u2019s genealogy of religion presents us with an\naccount of the same general conflict that he portrays in\nDialogues between Cleanthes\u2019s anthropomorphism and\nDemea\u2019s mysticism. This conflict, as Hume explains it, has deep\nroots in the dynamics of human nature and our conflicting\npropensities. The result of this process is an inherent instability in\ntheism itself. On the one side, there is a tendency, originally\npresent in polytheism, to anthropomorphize the gods in the hope of\nplacating and controlling them. On the other side, our\n\u201cexaggerated praise and compliments\u201d produce a refined and\nabstract idea of god that no longer satisfies the vulgar imagination.\nThe result of this situation is that there is \u201ca kind of flux\nand reflux in the human mind, and that men have a natural tendency to\nrise from idolatry to theism, and to sink again from theism into\nidolatry\u201d (NHR, 8.1).\n\nThe feeble apprehensions of men cannot be satisfied with conceiving\ntheir deity as a pure spirit and perfect intelligence; and yet their\nnatural terrors keep them from imputing to him the least shadow of\nlimitation and imperfection. They fluctuate between these opposite\nsentiments. (NHR, 8.2)\n\n\nThis influence of the human passions and propensities affects the\nstability of our idea of God in another way. Our natural fear of\nfuture events encourages a conception of God that is severe and cruel.\nAt the same time, \u201cthe spirit of praise and eulogy\u201d\npromotes an entirely contrary view (NHR, 176). Clearly, the general\npoint that Hume aims to establish by means of these observations is\nthat the natural sources of religion are in conflict with one another\nand generate a continual cycle of opposition and instability in our\nreligious beliefs and idea of god.\n\nHume\u2019s primary aim in The Natural History of Religion,\nas we have noted, is to show that the origin and foundations of\nreligious belief does not rest with reason or philosophical argument.\nThe origins of religious belief rest with human fear and ignorance,\nwhich gives rise, in the first place, to polytheism. The same\npsychological forces that give rise to polytheism gradually transform\nit into a system of theism. This system of theism is, however, itself\na product of conflicting tendencies in human nature that result in an\nunstable oscillation between anthropomorphic and mystical ideas of\ngod. As a result of this instability, there is a natural tendency for\ntheism to slide back into some form of polytheism that postulates\n\u201cdemi-gods\u201d, in order to satisfy the human need to have\nsome image or impression of God (NHR, 8.2, 15.5). Hume\u2019s remarks\non this tendency allude, clearly enough, to the case of Jesus Christ\nunderstood as the (human) incarnation of God.\n\nThe conclusion that Hume draws from all this is that religion\ngenerally rests on human weaknesses and vulnerabilities and that\nreason has little influence over its evolution or stability. While\n\u201cgenuine theism\u201d presents a view of God that is sublime\nand magnificent, most religion degrades and disfigures the idea of\ngod.\n\nSurvey most nations and most ages. Examine the religious principles,\nwhich have, in fact, prevailed in the world. You will scarcely be\npersuaded, that they are any thing but sick men\u2019s dreams. Or\nperhaps will regard them more as the playsome whimsies of monkeys in\nhuman shape, than the serious, positive, dogmatical assertions of a\nbeing who dignifies himself with the name of rational. (NHR, 184)\n\n9. Religion and Morality\n\nRichard Bentley, the first Boyle lecturer, neatly states the view that\nmany theists hold concerning the relationship between religion and\nmorality:\n\nAnd if Atheism should be supposed to become universal in this\nnation\u2026 farewell all ties of friendship and principles of\nhonor; all love for our country and loyalty to our prince; nay,\nfarewell all government and society itself, all professions and arts,\nand conveniences of life, all that is laudable or valuable in the\nworld. [Bentley, Folly of Atheism, in Works, III,\n25]\n\n\nThe general view defended by Bentley, and many other apologists for\nreligion, is that without religious principles and institutions to\nguide and motivate us, the moral world will collapse into nihilism,\negoism and the arbitrary rule of power. This view of things was\nfurther confirmed, as Hume\u2019s near contemporaries saw it, by the\nphilosophy of Hobbes. Hobbes\u2019s basic philosophical project was\nto advance a secular, scientific account of moral and political life.\nThe foundation of this, however, rests with egoism and moral\nscepticism. That is to say, according to Hobbes, human nature is\ndriven by psychological egoism and there is no real distinction\nbetween good and evil, right and wrong, just or unjust. It was a major\ntask of Hume\u2019s philosophy \u2014 particularly as presented in\nthe Treatise \u2014 to reconstruct Hobbes\u2019s secular,\nscientific account of morality while at the same time avoiding the\nextreme (undiluted) elements of moral scepticism and egoism present in\nit. Another way of stating these aims, is to say that Hume wanted to\nshow that \u201cspeculative atheism\u201d did not imply\n\u201cpractical atheism\u201d or moral licentiousness.\n\nAs already noted, Hume\u2019s Treatise appears to be\nmodelled after the same plan as Hobbes\u2019s project of a\n\u201cscience of man\u201d as presented in The Elements of\nLaw and Leviathan. On the basis of a naturalistic and\nnecessitarian conception of human nature, Hume aims to show how moral\nmotivation and practice is possible (i.e., to describe the possibility\nand reality of \u201cvirtuous atheism\u201d). There are several key\nelements in Hume\u2019s system of secular ethics. One important\nelement is the role of the indirect passions in accounting for the\nsanctions and support provided to moral life. On Hume\u2019s theory\nthe virtues and vices are understood as simply pleasurable or painful\nqualities of mind (cp. T, 3.1.2). A vicious character, he argues,\nproduces hate and humility (dishonour and shame) that makes us\nunhappy. In contrast with this, virtue produces love and pride, which\nmakes us happy. This is the fundamental mechanism by which virtue is\nrewarded and vice is punished. This mechanism operates no less\neffectively among atheists, who have no belief in God or a future\nstate, as it does among those with traditional theistic beliefs.\n\nAnother key element in Hume\u2019s system of secular ethics is the\nrole of sympathy. We are naturally constituted, Hume maintains, to\nshare the emotions of our fellow human beings. The closer our\nrelationship, and the more we resemble each other, the stronger the\ncommunication of emotion will be (T, 2.1.11;\n2.2.5.14\u201321/362\u20135). By means of this principle of\nsympathy, human beings naturally take an interest in the happiness and\nwelfare of others \u2014 especially our family, friends and\nneighbours. Hume denies, therefore, that human nature is wholly\nselfish or without any benevolent concerns or dispositions. At the\nsame time, Hume also emphasizes the point that our sympathetic and\nbenevolent tendencies are limited and highly partial \u2014 both of\nwhich pose serious obstacles for social peace and cooperation. Hume\ndenies, in particular, that there is any \u201csuch passion in human\nminds, as love of mankind, merely as such, independent of personal\nqualities, of services, or of relation to oneself\u201d (T, 3.2.1.12/\n481). In this way, while Hume plainly rejects Hobbist egoism and\nallows that we are naturally social beings in a number of significant\nrespects (i.e., family, friends etc.), he also insists that our human\nnature is such that self-love and partiality are extremely strong and\ncan and do lead to competition and conflict. This is something that we\nmust find a solution to if we are to be able to live together in\ngroups larger than families and small clans.\n\nOur human nature, combining both passions and reason, provides a\nremedy for this problem. In the first place, Hume denies that we lack\nany real standard of right and wrong or good and evil. The relevant\nstandard depends on our sentiments of pleasure and uneasiness (T,\n3.1.1.26 / 469). More specifically, our moral sentiments, understood\nas calm forms of love and hate, enable us to draw the relevant\ndistinctions in this sphere. Hume also claims that in forming these\njudgments we place ourselves in \u201ca steady and general point of\nview\u201d, which prevents partiality and variation in our\ncircumstances from prejudicing or distorting our moral evaluations (T,\n3.3.1.15\u201318 / 581\u20133).\n\nIt is evident that Hume aims to describe a standard of merit and\ndemerit that, although it depends on our given human nature, is in no\nway arbitrary or without rational constraints. At the same time,\nHume\u2019s account of justice and the artificial virtues does point\nto the importance of human conventions, which create or invent the\ninstitutions and practices associated with property and promising.\nThere are no obligations that we have in respect of these institutions\nand practices that are prior to or independent of these conventions.\nThe general basis of our commitment to these conventions is that they\nserve our individual and collective interest. Failing this, we would\nhave no relevant motive to obey these rules of justice. Clearly, then,\nwith respect to property, there are no natural rights or claims of\njustice outside our created, conventional practices. It is in this\nsense that Hume\u2019s views on justice and the artificial virtues\nfollow the same general lines of thought already laid down by Hobbes\nand his followers.\n\nThe details and specifics of Hume\u2019s system of secular ethics are\nnot our particular concern in this context. What is our concern,\nhowever, is to make clear that what Hume aims at, in both the\nTreatise and the second Enquiry, is to defend the\n\u201cautonomy\u201d of morality in relation to religion. On this\nview of things, God and a future state are wholly unnecessary for\nmoral life and human society. The relevant foundation for moral life\nand conduct rests with the key elements of human nature that we have\nmentioned \u2014 pride, sympathy, moral sense, and conventions.\nMoreover, the psychological mechanisms involved are strong and steady\nenough in their influence to ensure that there exists a reliable\ncorrelation between virtue and happiness and vice and misery. By these\nmeans, we find that human beings are constituted in such a way that\nthey are capable of moral conduct and able to sustain social\ncooperation and harmony. In so far as religion plays any role here,\nHume maintains, it is more likely to corrupt and disturb, than to\ncontribute, to morality or social stability.\n\nHume\u2019s account of the autonomy of morals and its foundations in\nhuman nature constitutes the constructive aspect of his views on the\nreligion/morality relationship. In developing this account, Hume draws\nheavily from earlier work by other freethinking, irreligious, and\nradical philosophers, such as Hobbes, Spinoza, Bayle, and (especially)\nShaftesbury. There is, however, a much more critical aspect to\nHume\u2019s views on the religion/morality relationship. While it is\nevident that Hume believes that religion is not necessary for\nmorality, he stops short of claiming that religion is always\ndestructive of morality \u2014 even though this is a view that would\nbe no more extreme than the contrary view frequently advanced by\nreligious apologists (i.e., that atheists are incapable of moral\nconduct etc.). Nevertheless, in a variety of contexts, Hume does\nmaintain that religion \u2014 especially monotheism \u2014 has\npernicious and corrupting tendencies.\n\nOne of the most sustained discussions of this general theme is in\nThe Natural History of Religion, where Hume compares the\neffects of polytheism and theism on their believers (Sects. IX-XIV).\nIn this context., Hume points out that while theism may avoid some of\nthe absurdities and barbarisms of polytheism, it is by no means free\nof these problems. On the contrary, it is Hume\u2019s view that\ntheism is prone to intolerance and persecution of its opponents; that\nit encourages its followers to abase themselves and pursue useless\nforms of self-denial; that it corrupts and perverts philosophy; that\nalthough it is plagued with doubts, it presents a dogmatic attitude to\nthe world; and, finally, that it breeds serious moral vices, including\nhypocrisy, fraud and cruelty. The tendencies of theism that most\nconcern Hume, however, are its intolerance and opposition to liberty,\nits distorted moral standard, and its willingness to sanction the\n\u201cgreatest crimes\u201d in the name of piety and devotion (NHR,\n14.7). Hume leaves his readers with the clear view that religion, far\nfrom being a source of support for moral practice, is in fact a major\nsource of moral sickness in the world.\n\nHume returns to these same general themes in the closing passages of\nthe Dialogues. In this context Philo emphasizes the point\nthat the doctrine of a future state has little practical influence\nover human conduct (D, 12.13\u201320/220\u201323).\n\nThis is well understood in the world; and none but fools ever repose\nless trust in a man, because they hear, that from study and\nphilosophy, he has entertained some speculative doubts with regard to\ntheological subjects. And when we have to do with a man, who makes a\ngreat profession of religion and devotion; has this any other effect\nupon several, who pass for prudent, than to put them on their guard,\nlest they be cheated and deceived by him? (D, 12.14/221)\n\n\nHume makes the further observation that even if religion does not put\nitself \u201cin direct opposition to morality\u201d, it nevertheless\nputs forward a \u201cfrivolous species of merit\u201d that suggests\n\u201ca preposterous distribution\u201d of praise and blame based\nupon a perverted moral standard that is disconnected from any real\nhuman needs and interests (D, 12.16/222; cp. EM, 3.38 199; 9.3/ 270;\n9.15 / 279). Beyond all this, he also points out the particular\ndangers to society of the clergy when they gain too much power and\ninfluence (D, 12.21/223). This is a theme that Hume also touches on\nthroughout many of his other writings, including The Natural\nHistory of Religion, several of his essays, and his History\nof England. (See, e.g., NHR, 9.6; \u201cOf National\nCharacters,\u201d ESY, 199n3; and HE, III,135f.)\n\nThe relationship between religion and morality on Hume\u2019s account\nseems clear. At best, religion has little practical influence in\nguiding or supporting moral conduct. The most effective and reliable\nlevers for this purpose rest with various elements of human nature\nthat operate independently from our religious beliefs (i.e., pride,\nsympathy, moral sense etc.). At its worst, which is how we commonly\nfind it, religious principles and institutions disturb and pervert\nthat natural and reasonable moral standards that human nature has\nprovided us with. \n10. Was Hume an Atheist?\n\nOne of the most hotly debated issues arising out of Hume\u2019s\nphilosophy is whether or not he was an atheist. Two methodological and\nhistorical caveats should be briefly noted before addressing this\nquestion. First, as already noted, many of Hume\u2019s own\ncontemporaries regarded him in these terms. Our own contemporaries\nhave tended to dismiss these claims as coming from religious bigots\nwho did not understand Hume\u2019s philosophy. While there may be\nsome basis for these concerns, this is not true of all of Hume\u2019s\nearly critics (e.g. Thomas Reid) and, even if it were, it would not\nshow that his critics were wrong about this matter. Second, and\nrelated to the first point, Hume lived and wrote at a time of severe\nreligious persecution, by both the church and the state. Unorthodox\nreligious views, and more especially any form of open atheism, would\ncertainly provoke strong reactions from the authorities. Caution and\nsubterfuge in these circumstances was essential if difficulties of\nthese kinds were to be avoided. (For this reason it is especially\nironic to find religious apologists who confidently read Hume\u2019s\nprofessions of orthodoxy as entirely sincere but who never mention the\nawkward conditions in which he had to express his views.) While\nconditions of suppression do not themselves prove a writer or thinker\nsuch as Hume had a concealed doctrine, this possibility should be\nseriously and carefully considered.\n\nThe view that has, perhaps, been most dominant during the past century\nhas been that Hume was a skeptic and, as such, stands in a position\nthat endorses neither theism nor atheism. On this reading Hume\u2019s\nskeptical principles commit him to the view that human understanding\nis weak and imperfect and, so considered, we should avoid all\ndogmatism and also refrain from pursuing our investigations beyond the\nnarrow sphere of \u201ccommon life\u201d. More specifically, the\nskeptic, it is argued, must resist the temptation to address questions\nrelating to the \u201ctwo eternities\u201d, as this concerns\n\u201cthe origin of worlds, and the situation of nature, from, and to\neternity\u201d (D, 1.10/134; EU, 12.25). Read this way, Hume is what\nwe may describe as a \u201csoft skeptic\u201d with respect to the\nissue of theism. Throughout his writings, while he is certainly\nconcerned to discredit various (dogmatic) proofs for the existence of\nGod, he also avoids advancing or endorsing any (dogmatic) atheistic\narguments and their conclusions \u2013 preferring to suspend all\nbelief on such matters (NHR, 15.13; D, 1.3\u201311/131\u201336,\n12.33\u20134/227\u20138).\n\nAgainst this (soft) skeptical reading critics have argued both that it\nexaggerates and that it underestimates Hume\u2019s skeptical\ncommitments. One way of assessing Hume\u2019s position on this issue\nis to begin with Hume\u2019s suggestion that \u201cgenuine\ntheism\u201d involves the minimal claim that there exists some\n(invisible) \u201csupreme intelligence\u201d that is the origin,\ncreator and governor of this world (NHR, 4.2). So described, genuine\ntheism involves what we may call a \u201cthin\u201d conception of\nGod. There is, on this account, no commitment to some further, more\nspecific, set of attributes. In contrast with thin theism,\n\u201crobust\u201d theism presupposes a richer set of attributes,\nsuch as infinity, omniscience, omnipotence, and moral perfection.\nWhether one is judged an atheist or not may depend, not only on\nwhether the standard of theism is robust or thin, it may also depend\non what particular set of \u201cthick\u201d attributes are\nconsidered essential for belief in God.\n\nClearly major religions like traditional Christianity require a robust\nconception of God. With regard to robust theism, Hume is sharply\ncritical and goes well beyond the bounds of a more limited soft\nskepticism. That is to say, Hume pursues what we may call the\nhard skeptical aim of providing grounds for denying\nthe theist hypothesis in its various robust forms. For example, in a\nnumber of passages of the Dialogues Hume suggests that the\nabundant evidence of unnecessary evil provides us with compelling\ngrounds for denying that there exists an omnipotent, morally perfect\nbeing who is the creator and governor of this world. In light of these\nconsiderations, we may conclude that with respect to robust\ntheism Hume is a hard skeptic who defends a non-dogmatic form\nof atheism.\n\nWhile Hume may be a hard skeptic about robust theism, it does not\nfollow that he is either a hard or a soft skeptic about thin theism.\nAgainst views of this kind, it has been argued by a number of scholars\nthat Hume is committed to some form of thin theism or\n\u201cattenuated deism\u201d. (See, e.g., Gaskin 1988.) The key\npassages that are generally relied on in support of this view are\nfound in the last section of the Dialogues (XII). It is in\nthis context that Philo is understood to \u201creverse\u201d his\nopposition to the design argument and concede to Cleanthes \u201cthat\nthe works of nature bear a great analogy\u201d to human\nproductions and that a \u201cpurpose, intention, or design strikes\neverywhere the most careless, the most stupid thinker\u201d (D,\n12.2/214, 12.6/216\u20137 \u2013 my emphasis; cp. NHR, Intro.1,\n15.1). There are, however, several important points to note in\nresponse to this aspect of Hume\u2019s discussion.\n\nFirst, Hume makes clear that this mode of (thin) theism leaves us\nstill in a state of \u201cprofound ignorance\u201d and that it\nprovides us with \u201cno inference that affects human life\u201d\n(D, 12.33/227; cp. EU, 11.23). Second, although Philo does make some\nconcessions to Cleanthes, he immediately goes on to perform a\n\u201cdouble reversal\u201d \u2013 retracting his original\nconcessions and returning to his original claim that there is a\n\u201cvast\u201d and \u201cincomprehensible\u201d difference that\nmust be supposed between the human and divine mind (D,\n12.6\u20137/217\u20139). All of which terminates in the (vague)\nconclusion \u201cthat the cause or causes of order in the universe\nprobably bear some remote analogy to human\nintelligence\u201d (D, 12.33/227 \u2013 my emphasis; see also EU,\n11.27, where Hume observes that the analogy involved here may be\ncompared to that between \u201cthe sun and a waxen taper\u201d\n[candle]). To strengthen the skeptical side of these reflections Hume\nhas Philo point out that there are other analogies available to us\n(e.g. the rotting of a turnip or the generation of an animal: D,\n12.7/217\u20139) which may suggest very different inferences and\nconclusions. Finally, to all this we may add that Hume\u2019s theory\nof belief, as presented in his earlier works, plainly implies that in\nthese circumstances there can be no belief in any such being.\nMore specifically, it is a feature of Hume\u2019s analysis of the\nmechanics of belief that when the analogy we are relying on is remote\nand imperfect, and the ideas involved are obscure and vague, belief\nwill be weakened if not completely erased (see, e.g., T,\n1.3.9.13\u20134; 1.3.13.25).\n\nIn light of these observations, we may conclude that it is highly\nproblematic to present Hume as any kind of theist, either\nrobust or thin. The question remains, however, whether his final\nskeptical attitude to thin theism is better understood as hard or soft\nin character? Hume\u2019s concluding remarks in the\nDialogues may suggest that the soft reading \u2013 stopping\nshort of any (atheistic) denial \u2013 is his final view (D,\n12.33/227\u20138). According to this interpretation, we should accept\nour epistemological predicament and avoid any final judgment on such\nmatters.\n\n\nThe whole is a riddle, an enigma, an inexplicable mystery. Doubt,\nuncertainty, suspense of judgment appear the only result of our most\naccurate scrutiny, concerning this subject. (NHR, 15.13)\n\n\nWhile it is tempting to leave this matter here, settling on the view\nthat Hume is a hard skeptic about robust theism and a soft\nskeptic about thin theism, there are, nevertheless, grounds\nfor pushing the matter further for the case for Hume\u2019s hard\nskepticism regarding thin theism. That is to say, if we examine\nHume\u2019s remarks more carefully, we will find some clear arguments\nof a hard skeptical variety as they concern the thin theist\nhypothesis.\n\nThere are two hard skeptical arguments concerning this hypothesis that\nare especially important. The first is that Hume points out that our\nexperience suggests that mind is always accompanied by body (D,\n5.11/68-, 6.6/171-2, 8.11/186-7). Any reasonable hypothesis,\ntherefore, should be consistent with this aspect of human experience.\nAlthough our experience may be narrow and limited, given the nature of\nthe object of our investigations, it nevertheless provides some\n(substantial) basis for rejecting or denying the hypothesis of theism,\nincluding the thin version. Second, Hume also argues that there are\nalternative hypotheses that are available to us that are more\nplausible and consistent with human experience. In particular, we may\neasily revise the old Epicurean hypothesis of eternal matter that\ngenerates cycles of chaos and order (D, 6.12/174, 8.2/182). This is a\nhypothesis that provides us with natural explanations for forms and\norders of life and existence in a manner that clearly anticipates\nimportant features of Darwinian theory. Arguments of these kinds\nsuggest that, even with respect to the minimalism of thin theism, Hume\ngoes well beyond a soft skepticism that simply \u201csuspends\nbelief\u201d on these issues. His arguments are harder than this and\npresent grounds for denying theism, both robust and thin. On\nthis basis we may conclude that Hume\u2019s skeptical commitments are\nhard and not soft with respect to the theist hypothesis in all its\nforms and, as such, constitute a non-dogmatic form of\natheism.\n11. Irreligion and the Unity of Hume\u2019s Philosophy\n\nIn the previous section it was suggested that Hume may be properly\ndescribed as a hard sceptic who is a non-dogmatic atheist. It remains\nan open question, however, whether \u201catheism\u201d is the most\nsuitable label for Hume\u2019s general position on this subject\n\u2013 apt as it may be. One important consideration here is that\nHume\u2019s (apparent) concessions to theism in the last section of\nthe Dialogues are indicative of significant features of his\npractical aims and objectives. More specifically, Hume\u2019s final\nposition is not aggressively atheistic in any familiar sense,\nnot only because it is non-dogmatic, but also because his final\nposition is one that aims to reconcile a broad group of\nviews. According to Hume\u2019s analysis, the practical\nconsequences of both soft and hard scepticism, as well as thin theism,\nare all much the same. While the thin theist may want to emphasize the\n(remote) basis for some inference to a being that resembles human\nintelligence, they must nevertheless grant that we are left in a state\nof \u201cprofound ignorance\u201d with a (weak and vague) idea that\ncannot serve to guide our lives in any way (D, 12.33/227). This\nreturns us to a point that Hume had made earlier in the\nDialogues; namely, that in both theoretical and practical\nterms a mystical form of theism \u2013 lacking any significant\nanthropomorphic features \u2013 is indistinguishable from a form of\nscepticism, where all conjectures about the nature of God remain\nentirely undecided, unknowable and irrelevant to human life (D,\n6.1/158, 12.7/217). With this general point in mind, Hume is happy to\nemphasize the \u201cverbal\u201d nature of the dispute among those\nwho may fall on the spectrum lying between thin theism and\nnon-dogmatic hard scepticism (D, 12.6-7/216-7). What really matters,\nHume suggests, is that the falsehoods, frauds, hypocrisies and\ncruelties of religion in the various (robust) forms that it almost\nalways takes are firmly resisted and rejected. This is a point that\nboth hard and soft skeptics, as well those who embrace religion of a\ngenuinely \u201cphilosophical and rational kind\u201d (D, 12.13/\n220), can all accept.\n\nGiven the more open-ended and inclusive nature of Hume\u2019s outlook\nand aims, the label of \u201catheism\u201d perhaps suggests a more\nnarrow and doctrinaire position than Hume is comfortable with or\nconcerned to champion. Granted that the label of \u201catheism\u201d\nis in these respects potentially misleading, and that\n\u201cscepticism\u201d and \u201cagnosticism\u201d fail to\nproperly identify and highlight Hume\u2019s wholly hostile and\ncritical attitude towards religious dogma and doctrine (in its\northodox forms), what alternative label is available to us? The most\naccurate and informative label for describing Hume\u2019s views on\nthis subject is perhaps irreligion. This is a term that both\nHume\u2019s contemporaries and our own would understand and can apply\nto Hume\u2019s arguments and outlook without any serious\nmisrepresentation. On one side, calling Hume\u2019s views on this\nsubject irreligious avoids any connotations of a dogmatic or rigid\natheism, one that is unwilling to accommodate or make common cause\nwith soft scepticism (agnosticism) or thin theism. On the other side,\nthe label of irreligion also makes clear that Hume\u2019s fundamental\nattitude towards religion (qua various forms of robust theism) is one\nof systematic hostility \u2013 that is, he believes we are\nbetter off without religion and religious hypotheses and\nspeculations.\n\nThe term irreligion has several other specific advantages. This term\nmakes clear that it is not simply (robust) \u201ctheism\u201d that\nHume aims to discredit and undermine but religion broadly conceived as\nincluding related doctrines (miracles, a future state, etc.) and\ninstitutions (church, clergy, etc.). The label of irreligion serves\neffectively to identify these wider concerns and places appropriate\nemphasis on Hume\u2019s destructive intent to leave religious\ndoctrine without any solid philosophical grounds or significant\ncontent \u2013 much less any practical value or influence. Related to\nthis point, by widening our scope of interest in religion, and\navoiding a narrow focus on arguments concerning the existence of God,\nwe are encouraged to consider works other than the Dialogues\nwhen assessing the nature and character of Hume\u2019s views on this\nsubject. It is, for example, especially important that proper weight\nbe given to Hume\u2019s effort in the Treatise to discredit\nthe metaphysical and moral paraphernalia of traditional theistic\nsystems and to redirect our philosophical investigations to \u201cthe\nstudy of man\u201d, whereby we may develop a secular, scientific\naccount of the true foundations of moral and social life. Insofar as\nwe consider Hume\u2019s views as advancing a \u201cphilosophy of\nirreligion\u201d, rather than simply atheism, we are more likely to\ncapture these more diverse, complex and subtle aspects of his thinking\non this subject. More importantly, when we consider Hume\u2019s\nthought from the point of view of the wider framework of irreligion,\nand not just the question of the existence of God, we are better\nplaced to recognize that his critique of religion constitutes the\nunifying motivation and central theme running throughout his entire\nphilosophy.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a id=\"HumWor\">Hume\u2019s Works</a>", "<a id=\"PriWor\">Primary Works</a>", "<a id=\"SecWor\">Secondary Works</a>", "<a id=\"morBib\">Bibliographies</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a id=\"HumWor\">Hume\u2019s Works</a>": ["</h3>\n<p>\nIn the entry above, we Follow the convention given in the\nNortons\u2019 <em>Treatise</em> and Beauchamp\u2019s\n<em>Enquiries</em>: we cite\nBook\u2009.\u2009Part\u2009.\u2009Section\u2009.\u2009Paragraph;\nfollowed by <em>page</em> references to the Selby-Bigge/Nidditch\neditions.
