    "main_text": "Naturalism and Non-naturalism\n3. Naturalism and Non-naturalism\n\nOne appealing feature of Glaucon\u2019s account of morality as a\nmutually advantageous convention is that it renders morality\u2019s\norigin and nature non-mysterious. Moral facts, on this sort of view,\nemerge as no more puzzling than facts about what is legal or polite.\nIn each case, the standing of some behavior (as moral, or legal, or\npolite) depends on its conforming to, or conflicting with, various\nstandards that have been put in place. Glaucon\u2019s account also\nmakes clear why it is that people might care deeply about\nmorality\u2019s demands (even as they are, in their own cases,\ntempted to violate them when they believe they can with impunity),\nsince the relevant conventions are mutually advantageous.\n\nYet conventionalist views such as Glaucon\u2019s have real\ndifficulties fitting with the common idea that the fundamental\nprinciples of morality are universal. Conventions, after all, are\ncontingent creations that differ from place to place and come in to,\nand go out of, existence. Moreover, conventions seem liable to\narbitrariness in ways that threaten to undermine their claim to\nauthority unless they are recognized (at least implicitly) as\nsatisfying some convention-independent standard. That some convention\ndemands something seems to provide reason to conform to the demand\nonly when the convention is, itself, just or reasonable, or in some\nother way good. And this suggests that, to whatever extent specific\nmoral rules and principles are products of convention, their claim to\nauthority relies on some standards that are not products of\nconvention.\n\nNeedless to say, these considerations are not decisive, and those who\nsee morality as a kind of convention have a variety of plausible ways\nto address the worries mentioned above. As a result, the view remains\nattractive. Still, many\u2014even many who think an appeal to\nconvention is essential to making sense of morality\u2014think that\nthe proper account of morality cannot be a matter of conventions\n\u201call the way\n down\u201d.[4]\n But that does not mean that they think that the standards that serve\nto justify the demands of (some) conventions are mysterious. Some, for\ninstance, argue that what makes a convention good, and so serves to\njustify its demands, is its contribution to overall happiness, while\nothers see the measure of conventions in their ability to advance the\ninterests of each considered singly, and still others maintain that\nthe value of conventions is found in their capacity to secure the\napproval of those who consider them impartially. On all such accounts,\nvalue is convention-independent, but it is nonetheless metaphysically\nnon-mysterious. Each of these accounts portrays value as, at bottom, a\nfamiliar, completely natural, feature of the world. Moreover, while\n(on these accounts) particular claims concerning value will prove hard\nto establish and controversial, there is no special puzzle about what\nwe would be trying to discover or what would count as relevant\nevidence.\n\nThese are all examples of naturalist accounts of morality that\nidentify various moral properties with non-problematic natural\nfeatures of the world. As a result, they are commonly characterized as\nversions of naturalism and are contrasted with non-naturalist views\nthat see morality as presupposing, or being committed to, properties\nover and above those that would be countenanced by natural\nscience.\n\nNon-naturalism comes with two distinctive burdens: (i) accounting for\nhow the realm of moral properties fits in with familiar natural\nproperties and (ii) explaining how it is that we are able to learn\nanything about these moral properties. Naturalism, in contrast, avoids\nthese metaphysical and epistemological burdens.\n\nDespite its advantages, naturalism has difficulty capturing well what\npeople take to be the true nature of morality. In saying something is\ngood or right or virtuous we seem to be saying something more than, or\nat least different from, what we would be saying in describing it as\nhaving certain natural features. Correspondingly, no amount of\nempirical investigation seems by itself, without some moral\nassumption(s) in play, sufficient to settle a moral question.
