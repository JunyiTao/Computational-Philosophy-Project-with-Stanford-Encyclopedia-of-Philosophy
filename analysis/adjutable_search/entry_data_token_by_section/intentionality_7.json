Is intensionality a criterion of intentionality?\n\nWithin the orthodox paradigm, an entirely different reaction to the\npuzzles of intentional inexistence has been to try to clarify the\nontological difficulties by ascending to a higher semantic level that\ncan, as Willard Van Orman Quine (1960, 272) says, \u201ccarry the\ndiscussion into a domain where both parties are better agreed on the\nobjects (viz., words).\u201d Semantic ascent allows one to rise from\ntalk about things to talk about talk about things, i.e., words. In\ncontemporary analytic philosophy, Roderick Chisholm (1957, 298) was\nthe first to contemplate the formulation of \u201ca working criterion\nby means of which we can distinguish sentences that are intentional,\nor are used intentionally, in a certain language from sentences that\nare not.\u201d The idea is to examine sentences that report\nintentionality rather than intentionality itself.\n\nIntensionality (with an s) is non-extensionality. Two\nfeatures are characteristic of extensionality. First, if a linguistic\ncontext is extensional, two coreferential terms can be substituted one\nfor the other salva veritate as illustrated by (16) and\n(17):\n\nHesperus shines.\nPhosphorus shines.\n\n\nIf (16) is true, so is (17). Secondly, the law of existential\ngeneralization applies to either (16) or (17) to yield\n\u2018\u2203x(x shines).\u2019 Not so with\nintensionality. As illustrated by examples (3) and (4) repeated here,\nthe truth of (3) does not always entail the truth of (4):\n\nAva believes that Hesperus is shining.\nAva believes that Phosphorus is shining.\n\n\nNor can existential generalization always be validly applied to\nsentences reporting beliefs, since from the fact that John believes\nthat angels have wings, it does not follow that there are things such\nthat John believes of them that they have wings.\n\nChisholm\u2019s criterion of intensionality is threefold. First, a\nsentence reports an intentional phenomenon if it contains a singular\nterm that purports to refer to some object and it is such that neither\nit nor its negation implies that the purported reference of the\nsingular term does or does not exist. The first criterion amounts to\nthe recognition that if a sentence containing a singular term reports\nan intentional phenomenon, then it fails to satisfy the law of\nexistential generalization (from \u2018Fa\u2019 infer\n\u2018\u2203xFx\u2019). Secondly, a true sentence reports\nan intentional phenomenon if it contains a singular term\n\u2018a\u2019 and if replacement of\n\u2018a\u2019 by coreferential term\n\u2018b\u2019 results in transforming the true sentence\ninto a false sentence that differs only from the former in that\n\u2018b\u2019 replaces \u2018a\u2019. The second\ncriterion amounts to recognition that if a sentence containing a\nsingular term reports an intentional phenomenon, then it fails the\ntest of the substitutivity of coreferential terms salva\nveritate. Finally, if a complex sentence containing an embedded\n\u2018that\u2019-clause reports an intentional phenomenon, then\nneither it nor its negation entail the truth of the proposition\nexpressed by the embedded \u2018that\u2019-clause.\n\nChisholm (1957) argued that reports or descriptions of intentional or\npsychological phenomena cannot be reduced to (or eliminated in favor\nof) descriptions of behavior. The intensionality or non-extensionality\nof reports of intentionality was taken to show that descriptions and\nexplanations of psychological phenomena cannot be described nor\nexplained in terms of a vocabulary describing non-intentional\nphenomena. As Quine (1960, 220) put it, \u201cthere is no breaking\nout of the intentional vocabulary by explaining its members in other\nterms\u201d. Chisholm (1957) took this conclusion to show the\ncorrectness of Brentano\u2019s third thesis that intentionality\nis the mark of the mental.\n\nThe question can be decomposed into two questions. On the one hand,\nacceptance of intensionality as the criterion of intentionality seems\nto reflect the endorsement of a general linguistic view of\nintentionality in the following sense: what matters to the mental\n(i.e. non-linguistic) state reported are the properties of the\nlinguistic report. There are at least two reasons for scepticism about\nthe linguistic view of intentionality. On the other hand, there are\nsome specific reasons for questioning two of Chisholm\u2019s\ncriteria. I start with the latter. It seems hard to deny that states\nof knowledge are states with intentionality. At least,\nreports of knowledge states satisfy Chisholm\u2019s second\nnon-substitutivity criterion. From the fact that knowledge ascription\n(18) is true, it does not follow that (19) is, even though\n\u2018Cicero\u2019 and \u2018Tully\u2019 are coreferential:\n\nTom knows that Cicero denounced Catiline.\nTom knows that Tully denounced Catiline.\nCicero denounced Catiline.\n\n\nHowever, unlike belief reports, reports of knowledge are\nfactive: (18) could not be true unless (20) was true and\nCicero did in fact denounce Catiline. Thus, unlike belief reports,\nreports of knowledge fail Chisholm\u2019s third criterion. Given that\n(20) is extensional, it obeys the law of existential generalization.\nIf the truth of (20) follows from the truth of (18) and if (20)\nsatisfies the law of existential generalization, then so does (18). If\nso, then knowledge reports also fail to satisfy Chisholm\u2019s first\ncriterion.\n\nOne way to deal with this objection might be to argue that knowledge\nreports fail the test of existential generalization precisely because,\nunlike belief states, states of knowledge fail to exhibit\nBrentano\u2019s intentional inexistence: only beliefs, not states of\nknowledge, can be directed towards states of affairs that fail to\nobtain and towards non-existent entities. Alternatively, one might\nmake a distinction between states with a stronger and states with a\nweaker intentionality. Reports of the former (like beliefs) satisfy\nChisholm\u2019s three criteria. Reports of the latter (like states of\nknowledge) only fail the substitutivity test.\n\nThe problem with this strategy is that there are sentences that seem\nto describe intentional relations and that, unlike knowledge reports,\nare not intensional at all, for they pass the substitutivity\ntest. This is the case of sentences about what Fred Dretske (1969)\ncalls nonepistemic perception. If, when he was alive, someone\nsaw the French writer Romain Gary, then she ipso facto saw\nAjar, for Ajar was no other than Romain Gary. However, if she failed\nto know that \u2018Ajar\u2019 was another name for Romain Gary,\nwhile seeing Romain Gary, she may have failed to see that the\nman in front of her was Ajar. A fortiori, in this nonepistemic sense,\none cannot see an individual unless there is an individual to be seen.\nOne possible response might be to bite the bullet and deny that\nnonepistemic perception is an intentional state at all. If so, then,\nas Zalta (1988, 13) notes, linguistic reports of intentional phenomena\ndo satisfy at least one of Chisholm\u2019s criteria of\nintensionality.\n\nIf seeing is intentional, then not all reports of intentionality are\nintensional. That not all reports of intentionality are intensional is\na problem for the linguistic view according to which intensionality is\nthe criterion of intentionality. A second problem is that\nintensionality is also a feature of sentences that are about phenomena\nother than intentionality. Sentences that involve or are about\nmodalities such as necessity, about natural laws, about causation all\nexhibit intensionality. So, for example, the truth of (21) does not\nentail the truth of (22) even though everything that happens to\nexemplify property Q happens to exemplify property\nR:\n\nIt is a natural law that all Ps are Q.\nIt is a natural law that all Ps are R.\n\n\nBut necessity, natural laws or causation do not, on the face of it,\nexhibit what Brentano took to be the defining characteristics of\nintentionality. So it seems as if the intensionality of the report of\na phenomenon is neither necessary nor sufficient for the\nintentionality of the reported phenomenon. Arguably, \u2018P\u2019,\n\u2018Q\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019 in (21)-(22) are not singular\nterms at all. If they are treated as such, then, even though they may\nbe true of the same set of individuals, they do not refer or express\none and the same property. Still, the point illustrated by nomicity is\nthat the intensionality of a linguistic report is not sufficient for\nthe intentionality of the reported phenomenon.\n",
