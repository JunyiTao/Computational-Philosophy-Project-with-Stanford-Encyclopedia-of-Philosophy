States of Affairs in the Metaphysics of Perception and Value\n\nSo far states of affairs may seem to be useful theoretical constructs\nof philosophical semantics and modal theory. For example, Taylor\n(1976: 263) introduced a notion of states of affairs that is language\nrelative: different languages posit different totalities of state of\naffairs. Are there reasons to introduce states of affairs\nindependently of theorizing about language and modality?\n4.1 States of Affairs as the Primary Objects of Perception\n\nOne answer to this question takes states of affairs to be the things\nwe directly perceive. Here is an argument from the recent literature\nthat will get us started in thinking about this view:\n\n\nWhile we often speak of perceiving objects alone (a bird, a\nbush, a cloud, a star) or properties alone\u2014depending on the\npurpose of our attention or the purpose of our reporting\u2014it does not\nseem possible to perceive objects without at least some of their\nproperties, or to perceive properties without perceiving at least some\ninstantiations of these properties. (Church 2013: 11)\n\n\nChurch concludes that \u201cperception is always perception of a\nstate of affairs\u201d (ibid. See also Levinson 2006: 576)\n\nAccording to this Argument from Perception, perceptual reports such as\n\u201cI saw a robin yesterday\u201d are incomplete. What I saw was\nthe state of affairs of the robin\u2019s being a certain way. I\nreport that I saw a robin because my attention was focused on the\nbird.\n\nSome champions of states of affairs want to resist the Argument from\nPerception. Husserl (1901: \u00a7 28) and Reinach (1911: 341f]) denied\nthat states of affairs can be perceived. They argued that only\nparticulars, birds, bushes etc., can be the direct objects of\nperception. We say \u201cNN saw that a robin sat on a\ntwig.\u201d But these utterances are supposed to be reports of\njudgements that depend on perceptions of particulars. Hence,\nthe existence of such reports is supposed to be compatible with the\nclaim that states of affairs can only be the correlates of\njudgements.\n\nThe Argument from Perception indeed needs strengthening. The move\nfrom:\n\nNecessarily, if one perceives x, one perceives a property of x.\n\nto\n\nNecessarily, one perceives (the state of affairs of) x\u2019s having\na property\n\nis not valid. If one sees the robin, it appears distinct from its\nenvironment. The robin can only appear distinct from its environment\nif one perceives at least one property of it. But that one perceives\nan object in virtue of perceiving some of its properties does not yet\nimply that one perceives the object\u2019s having the property.\nConsider an analogy: I can only touch an object if I touch a part of\nit. But that does not mean that I really touch a different object: the\nobject\u2019s having the part.\n\nEven if the argument above can be strengthened, the strengthened\nversion seems only to show that the primary objects of perception are\nproperty instantiations or facts (see Church 2013: 12). Seeing is a\nfactive mental state. Hence, if I see the robin perching on the twig,\nand things are as they visually seem to me, it is a fact that the\nrobin is perching on the twig. At best the Argument from Perception\ngives us a reason to believe in facts, but not in states of\naffairs.\n\nHowever, there is an argument in the vicinity of the Argument from\nPerception that speaks to the existence of states of affairs. McDowell\nused the thesis that we perceive the referents of\n\u2018that\u2019-clauses as a basis for direct realism:\n\n\nIn a particular experience in which one is not misled, what one takes\nin is that things are thus and so. That things are thus\nand so is the content of the experience, and it can also be the\ncontent of the judgement if the subject decides to take the experience\nat face value [\u2026]. But, that things are thus and so is\nalso, if one is not misled, an aspect of the layout of the world: it\nis how things are. (McDowell 1994: 26)\n\n\nIf a particular experience, McDowell argues, does not mislead\nus, it discloses the fact that things are thus and so. This very\nfact can be judged and will be among the facts that make up the world.\nSo much about veridical perception. What about non-veridical\nperception?\n\nIf we assume that veridical and non-veridical perception have a common\nfactor, states of affairs start to pull their weight in the theory of\nperception. Consider two different kinds of non-veridical perception:\nhallucination and illusion.\n\nHallucination: if you visually hallucinate an oasis, you are\nnot mistaken about something you see: prima facie, there is\nnothing to see. But even hallucinations seem to be perceptual\nawareness of something. Johnston (2004: 134f) therefore describes\nvisual hallucinations as perceptual awareness of a complex property\n(he calls it a \u201cprofile\u201d), a way some things might be,\nthat is not instantiated (at the time).\n\nIllusion: if the stick that is straight looks bent to you,\nthere is something you see, the stick, but it is not the way it\nvisually seems to you: you see the stick, but it is not bent. How can\none conceptualise such illusions? Johnston takes his cue from the\nhallucination case. An illusion is an improved hallucination: we are\naware of a complex property that is in part instantiated:\n\n\nIllusion is seeing a particular combined with non-veridical seeing of\nthe particular as thus and so. When the seeing as is\nprimary in this way, one is aware of a particular and one is aware of\na complex profile, only part of which is instantiated by the\nparticular. One also sees the particular as instantiating parts of the\nprofile, parts that it does not instantiate. (Johnston 2004: 174)\n\n\nIf you experience the straight stick as bent, there is something your\nexperience is of. This is not only the stick, but something which\ncombines the stick and being bent: the state of affairs of the\nstick\u2019s being bent (at a time). This state of affairs exists,\nbut does not obtain. Your visual experience has an object, but because\nthe object does not obtain, you suffer an illusion.\n\nIn sum: states of affairs offer themselves up to systematize the\nrelations between seeing, visual hallucination and illusion. For\ninstance, one might suggest the following explications:\u00a0\nS\u2019s experience as of a\u2019s being F is S\u2019s seeing a to\nbe F, if, and only if, the state of affairs of a\u2019s being F\nobtains and causes the experience in the right way; S\u2019s\nexperience is an illusion if, and only if, the state of affairs does\nnot obtain; and the experience is a hallucination if, and only if,\nonly the state of affairs of a\u2019s being F does not exist, but its\nproperty-part does.\n\nThis systematization is based on the assumption that there is a common\nfactor in seeing and suffering from a visual illusion: both are\nexperiences of a state of affairs, the only difference is that the\nstates of affairs does not obtain in the second case. McDowell (see\nhis 1982) and other philosophers argue that it is a mistake to hold\nthat veridical perception and illusion involve a common factor. The\nplausibility of an argument for states of affairs as the primary\nobjects of perception depends on the defensibility of the common\nfactor assumption.\n\n\u00a0\n4.2 States of Affairs in the Metaphysics of Value\n\nWhich things are good for their own sake and without qualification?\nParticulars like the Taj Mahal? Properties like Beauty or Justice? Or\nsomething else?\n\nThe British philosopher William David Ross was one of the first who\nargued that one could make progress with these questions about value\nby bringing in the referents of \u2018that\u2019-clauses:\n\n\nConsideration of the question is aided if we adopt the view [\u2026] that\nwhat is good or bad is always something properly expressed by a\nthat-clause, i.e. an objective, or as I should prefer to call it, a\nfact. (Ross 1930: 137)\n\n\nAccording to Ross, Justice is not intrinsically good. What is\nintrinsically good is that someone or other is just.\nRabinowicz and R\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 2000 argue against Ross\u2019s\nthesis: sometimes that a is F is good because a is\ngood. If their arguments are convincing, objectives are not the only\nkind of thing that is good/bad for its own sake.\n\nIf \u2018that\u2019 clauses introduce bearers of intrinsic value,\nwhat do these clauses refer to in ascriptions of value? It seems\nintuitively implausible to holds that thoughts are\nintrinsically good (bad). Thoughts represent how things might be or\nnot. A representation might have value but its value depends, at least\nin part, on what it represents. Hence, thoughts seem not to be bearers\nof intrinsic value. Neither facts nor states of affairs represent how\nthings might be or not. Hence, both are candidates for the role of\nbeing bearers of intrinsic value.\n\nRoss (see above) opted for facts as the bearers of intrinsic value.\nThis view is defended, among others, by Lemos (1994: 23\u20135) and\nZimmerman (2001: 51ff) although Zimmerman rejects the\n\u201cfact\u201d terminology and prefers to talk about\nproperty-exemplifications. Chisholm and Sosa (1966: 244) assumed that\nstates of affairs are bearers of intrinsic value. But they warned the\nreader:\n\n\nOrdinarily, one would not say of any unexemplified state of affairs\n(say, that everyone is happy) that it is good, or bad, or better than\nsome other state of affairs. One might say, instead, that the state of\naffairs would be good, or bad, or better than some state of affairs if\nonly it were exemplified. (ibid.)\n\n\nThis warning is the cue for Zimmerman\u2019s (2001: 47) argument for\nthe conclusion that property-exemplifications (facts) and not state of\naffairs are value-bearers. If something has an intrinsic value, it has\nit in all circumstances. Hence, a state of affairs cannot have final\nvalue if it obtained (were exemplified) and be without value if does\nnot obtain (is not exemplified). If the value of the state of affairs\ndepended on the state of affairs\u2019s obtaining, the state of\naffairs itself would not be the true bearer of value. The true bearer\nof value is the object that exists in all and only those situations in\nwhich the state of affairs obtains. The true bearer of intrinsic value\nis fact that exists in all and only those situation in which the state\nof affairs obtains.\n\nIf non-obtaining states of affairs can have intrinsic value, this\nargument does not get off the ground. Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen (2000, 401f) outline considerations that\nsupport the view that some non-obtaining states of affairs are\nintrinsically good (bad). We value (love/like) the state of affairs of\neveryone\u2019s being happy. For example, although you know that this\nstate of affairs does not and probably will never obtain, you like it\nand like it more than the obtaining states of affairs. The question at\nissue between the fact and the state of affairs view of intrinsic\nvalue is whether a state of affairs is good (bad) because worlds in\nwhich it obtains are good (bad) or whether worlds in which the state\nof affairs obtains are good (bad) because the state of affairs is good\n(bad).\n",
