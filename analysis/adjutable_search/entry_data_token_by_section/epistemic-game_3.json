    "main_text": "The Epistemic View of Games || Incomplete Information\n1.4 Incomplete Information\nA natural question to ask about any mathematical model of\na game situation is how does the analysis change if the players\nare uncertain about some of the parameters of the model? This\nmotivated Harsanyi\u2019s fundamental work introducing the notion of\na game-theoretic type and defining a Bayesian\ngame in Harsanyi 1967\u201368. Using these ideas, an\nextensive literature has developed that analyzes games in which\nplayers are uncertain about some aspect of the game. (Consult\nLeyton-Brown & Shoham (2008: ch. 7) for a concise summary of the\ncurrent state-of-affairs and pointers to the relevant literature.) One\ncan naturally wonder about the precise relationship between this\nliterature and the literature we survey in this entry on the epistemic\nfoundations of game theory. Indeed, the foundational literature we\ndiscuss here largely focuses on Harsanyi\u2019s approach to modeling\nhigher-order beliefs (which we discuss in Section\n2.3).\nThere are two crucial differences between the literature on\nBayesian games and the literature we discuss in this entry (cf. the\ndiscussion in Brandenburger 2010: sec. 4 and 5).\n\nIn a Bayesian game, players are uncertain about the payoffs of the\ngame, what other players believe are the correct payoffs, what other\nplayers believe that the other players believe about the payoffs, and\nso on, and this is the only source of uncertainty. That is, the\nplayers\u2019 (higher-order) beliefs about the payoffs in a game\ncompletely determine the (higher-order) beliefs about the other\naspects of the game. In particular, if a player comes to know\nthe payoffs of the other players, then that player is certain (and\ncorrect) about the possible (rational) choices of the other\nplayers.[3]\nIt is assumed that all players choose optimally given their\ninformation. That is, all players choose a strategy that maximizes\ntheir expected utility given their beliefs about the game, beliefs\nabout what other players believe about the game, and so on. This\nmeans, in particular, that players do not entertain the possibility\nthat their opponents may choose \u201cirrationally.\u201d\n\nNote that these assumptions are not inherent in the formalism that\nHarsanyi used to represent the players\u2019 beliefs in a game of\nincomplete information. Rather, they are better described as\nconventions followed by Harsanyi and subsequent researchers studying\nBayesian games.\n",
