The Methods: Foundationalism and Doubt\n\nOf his own methodology, Descartes writes:\n\nThroughout my writings I have made it clear that my method imitates\nthat of the architect. When an architect wants to build a house which\nis stable on ground where there is a sandy topsoil over underlying\nrock, or clay, or some other firm base, he begins by digging out a set\nof trenches from which he removes the sand, and anything resting on or\nmixed in with the sand, so that he can lay his foundations on firm\nsoil. In the same way, I began by taking everything that was doubtful\nand throwing it out, like sand \u2026 (Replies 7, AT 7:536f, CSM\n2:366)\n\n\nThe theory whereby items of knowledge are best organized on an analogy\nto architecture traces back to ancient Greek thought \u2013 to\nAristotle, and to work in geometry. That Descartes\u2019 method\neffectively pays homage to Aristotle is, of course, a welcome result\nfor his Aristotelian audience. But Descartes views Aristotle\u2019s\nfoundationalist principles as incomplete, at least when applied to\nmetaphysical inquiry. His method of doubt is intended to complement\nfoundationalism. The two methods are supposed to work in cooperation,\nas conveyed in the above quotation. Let\u2019s consider each\nmethod.\n",
