    "main_text": "The descriptive question: What are the features of consciousness? || Unity\n4.6 Unity\n\nUnity is closely linked with the self-perspective, but it\nmerits specific mention on its own as a key aspect of the organization\nof consciousness. Conscious systems and conscious mental states both\ninvolve many diverse forms of unity. Some are causal unities associated\nwith the integration of action and control into a unified focus of\nagency. Others are more representational and intentional forms of unity\ninvolving the integration of diverse items of content at many scales\nand levels of binding (Cleeremans 2003).\n\n\nSome such integrations are relatively local as when diverse features\ndetected within a single sense modality are combined into a\nrepresentation of external objects bearing those features, e.g. when\none has a conscious visual experience of a moving red soup can passing\nabove a green striped napkin (Triesman and Gelade 1980).\n\n\nOther forms of intentional unity encompass a far wider range of\ncontents. The content of one's present experience of the room in which\none sits depends in part upon its location within a far larger\nstructure associated with one's awareness of one's existence as an\nongoing temporally extended observer within a world of spatially\nconnected independently existing objects (Kant 1787, Husserl 1913). The\nindividual experience can have the content that it does only because it\nresides within that larger unified structure of representation. (See\nthe entry on\n unity of consciousness.)\n\nParticular attention has been paid recently to the notion of\nphenomenal unity (Bayne 2010) and its relation to other forms of\nconscious unity such as those involving representational, functional\nor neural integration. Some have argued that phenomenal unity can be\nreduced to representational unity (Tye 2005) while others have denied\nthe possibility of any such reduction (Bayne 2010).\n",
