Anarchist Challenges to Political Obligation\n\nUntil recently, most political philosophers have assumed that subjects\nof a (moderately just) state have political obligations, while\ndisputing why that is so. Indeed, in the middle years of the twentieth\ncentury some philosophers even asserted, on conceptual grounds, that\npolitical obligation needs no justification. As one of them put the\npoint, \u201cto ask why I should obey any laws is to ask whether\nthere might be a political society without political obligations,\nwhich is absurd. For we mean by political society, groups of people\norganized according to rules enforced by some of their number\u201d\n(Macdonald 1951, p. 192; also McPherson 1967, p. 64, and, more subtly,\nPitkin 1966; but cf. Pateman 1973, and Horton 2010, pp. 138\u201346).\nThis view did not long prevail, but it testifies to the strength of\nthe tendency to believe that citizens surely have an obligation to\nobey the laws of their country, at least if it is reasonably just.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, however, skeptics have come to occupy a\nprominent place in debates over political obligation. As they see it,\nthere is no general obligation to obey the law, not even on the part\nof the citizens of a reasonably just polity. The most thorough-going\nof these dissenters have been anarchists proper \u2013 that is, those\nwho insist that states and governments are necessarily immoral\ninstitutions that ought to be abolished. Other skeptics or dissenters\nhave concluded, though, that the anarchist proper is wrong about the\nneed for the state but right about the lack of an obligation to obey\nthe law. Like the anarchist proper, these \u201cphilosophical\nanarchists\u201d hold that the state is illegitimate, but they deny\nthat its illegitimacy entails \u201ca strong moral imperative to\noppose or eliminate states; rather they typically take state\nillegitimacy simply to remove any strong moral presumption in favor of\nobedience to, compliance with, or support for our own or other\nexisting states\u201d (Simmons 2001, p. 104; but note Huemer 2013,\nwho regards philosophical anarchism as a second-best alternative that\ncould prepare the way for anarchism proper).\n",
