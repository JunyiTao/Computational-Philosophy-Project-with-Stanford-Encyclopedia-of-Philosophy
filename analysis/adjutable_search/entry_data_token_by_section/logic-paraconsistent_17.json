    "main_text": "Systems of Paraconsistent Logic || Many-Valued Logics\n3.7 Relevant Logics\n\nThe approaches to paraconsistency we have examined above all focus on\nthe inevitable presence or the truth of some contradictions. A\nrejection of ECQ, in these approaches, depends on an analysis of the\npremises containing a contradiction. One might think that the real\nproblem with ECQ is not to do with the contradictory premises but to\ndo with the lack of connection between the premises and the\nconclusion. The thought is that the conclusion must be\nrelevant to the premises in a valid inference.\n\nRelevant logics\n were pioneered in order to study the relevance of the conclusion with\nrespect to the premises by Anderson and Belnap (1975) in Pittsburgh.\nAnderson and Belnap motivated the development of relevant logics using\nnatural deduction systems; yet they developed a family of relevant\nlogics in axiomatic systems. As development proceeded and was carried\nout also in Australia, more focus was given to the semantics.\n\nThe semantics for relevant logics were developed by Fine (1974),\nRoutley and Routley (1972), Routley and Meyer (1993) and Urquhart\n(1972). (There are also algebraic semantics; see for example Dunn\n& Restall 2002: 48ff.) Routley-Meyer semantics is based on\npossible-world semantics, which is the most studied semantics for\nrelevant logics, especially in Australasia. In this semantics,\nconjunction and disjunction behave in the usual way. But each world,\n\\(w\\), has an associate world, \\(w^*\\), and negation is evaluated in\nterms of \\(w^*: \\neg A\\) is true at \\(w\\) iff \\(A\\) is false, not at\n\\(w\\), but at \\(w^*\\). Thus, if \\(A\\) is true at \\(w\\), but false at\n\\(w^*\\), then \\(A \\wedge \\neg A\\) is true at \\(w\\). To obtain the\nstandard relevant logics, one needs to add the constraint that\n\\(w^{**} = w\\). As is clear, negation in these semantics is an\nintensional operator.\n\nThe primary concern with relevant logics is not so much with negation\nas with a conditional connective \\(\\rightarrow\\) (satisfying modus\nponens). In relevant logics, if \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is a logical\ntruth, then \\(A\\) is relevant to \\(B\\), in the sense that \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) share at least one propositional variable.\n\nSemantics for the relevant conditional are obtained by furnishing each\nRoutley-Meyer model with a ternary relation. In the\nsimplified semantics of Priest and Sylvan (1992) and Restall (1993,\n1995), worlds are divided into normal and non-normal. If \\(w\\) is a\nnormal world, \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is true at \\(w\\) iff at all worlds\nwhere \\(A\\) is true, \\(B\\) is true. If \\(w\\) is non-normal, \\(A\n\\rightarrow B\\) is true at \\(w\\) iff for all \\(x, y\\), such that\n\\(Rwxy\\), if \\(A\\) is true at \\(x, B\\) is true at \\(y\\). If \\(B\\) is\ntrue at \\(x\\) but not at \\(y\\) where \\(Rwxy\\), then \\(B \\rightarrow\nB\\) is not true at \\(w\\). Then one can show that \\(A \\rightarrow (B\n\\rightarrow B)\\) is not a logical truth. (Validity is defined as truth\npreservation over normal worlds.) This gives the basic\nrelevant logic, \\(B\\). Stronger logics, such as the logic \\(R\\), are\nobtained by adding constraints on the ternary relation.\n\nThere are also versions of world-semantics for relevant logics based\non Dunn\u2019s relational semantics for FDE. Then negation\nis extensional. A conditional connective, now needs to be given both\ntruth and falsity conditions. So we have: \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is true\nat \\(w\\) iff for all \\(x, y\\), such that \\(Rwxy\\), if \\(A\\) is true at\n\\(x, B\\) is true at \\(y\\); and \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is false at \\(w\\)\niff for some \\(x, y\\), such that \\(Rwxy\\), if \\(A\\) is true at \\(x,\nB\\) is false at \\(y\\). Adding various constraints on the ternary\nrelation provides stronger logics. However, these logics are not the\nstandard relevant logics developed by Anderson and Belnap. To obtain\nthe standard family of relevant logics, one needs neighbourhood frames\n(see Mares 2004). Further details can be found in the entry on\n relevant logics.\n",
