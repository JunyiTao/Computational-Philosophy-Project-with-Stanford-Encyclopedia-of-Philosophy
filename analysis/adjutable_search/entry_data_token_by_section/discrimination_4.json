    "main_text": "Types of Discrimination (in its Moralized Sense) || Direct Discrimination\n2.1 Direct Discrimination\n\n\nConsider the following, clear instance of direct discrimination.  In\n2002, several men of Roma descent entered a bar in a Romanian town and\nwere refused service. The bar employee explained his conduct by\npointing out to them a sign saying, \u201cWe do not serve\nRoma.\u201d The Romanian tribunal deciding the case ruled that the\nRoma men had been the victims of unlawful direct\ndiscrimination (Schiek, Waddington, & Bell 2007: 185). The\nbar\u2019s policy, as formulated in its sign, explicitly and\nintentionally picked out the Roma qua Roma for disadvantageous\ntreatment. It was those two features\u2014explicitness and\nintention\u2014that made the Roma case a paradigmatic example of\ndirect discrimination. Such examples of discrimination are cases in\nwhich the agent acts with the aim of imposing a disadvantage on\npersons for being members of some salient social group. In the Roma\ncase, the bartender and bar owner aimed to exclude Roma for being\nRoma, and so both the owner\u2019s policy and the bartender\u2019s\nmaxim of action explicitly referred to the exclusion of Roma. It is\nclear that the policy of the bar was wrong, but the question of what\nmakes the policy and other instances direct discrimination wrongful\nwill be put on hold until section 4.1 below.\n\n\nIn some cases, a discriminator will adopt a policy that, on its face,\nmakes no explicit reference to the group that he or she aims to\ndisadvantage. Instead, the policy employs some facially-neutral\nsurrogate that, when applied, accomplishes the discriminator\u2019s\nhidden aim. For example, during the Jim Crow era, southern states\nused literacy tests for the purpose of excluding African-Americans from\nthe franchise. Because African-Americans were denied adequate\neducational opportunities and because the tests were applied in a\nracially-biased manner, virtually all of the persons disqualified by\nthe tests were African-Americans, and, in any given jurisdiction, the\nvast majority of African-American adults seeking to vote were\ndisqualified. The point of the literacy tests was precisely such\nracial exclusion, even though the testing policy made no explicit\nreference to race.\n\n\nNotwithstanding the absence of an explicit reference to race in the\nliteracy tests themselves, their use was a case of direct\ndiscrimination. The reason is that the persons who formulated,\nvoted for, and implemented the tests acted on maxims that did\nmake explicit reference to race. Their maxim was something along\nthe lines of: \u2018In order to exclude African-Americans from the\nfranchise and do so in a way that appears consistent with the U.S.\nConstitution, I will favor a legal policy that is racially-neutral on\nits face but in practice excludes most African-Americans and leaves\nwhites unaffected.\u2019 As with the Roma case, there were\nagents whose aim was to disadvantage persons for belonging to a certain\nsocial group.\n\n\nHowever, it is too simple to say that direct discrimination\nsimply is intentional discrimination. Lippert-Rasmussen\nrightly points out that there can be cases of direct discrimination\nnot involving the intention to disadvantage anyone on account of her\ngroup membership (2014: 59\u201360). A disadvantage might, instead,\nbe imposed as a result of a general indifference toward the interests\nand rights of the members of a certain group.  Thus, an employer might\nuse hiring criteria that unfairly disadvantages women, not because the\nemployer intends to disadvantage women, but because the criteria are\neasy to use and he simply does not care that women are unfairly\ndisadvantaged as a result.  Such instances of discrimination might not\nhave the paradigmatic status that an example like the Roma case has,\nbut they should be counted as forms of direct discrimination, because\nthe disadvantageous treatment derives from an objectionable mental\nstate of the agent.  The same goes for disadvantageous treatment that\nis the product of bias against a certain group, even when the bias\ndoes not involve an intention to treat the group disadvantageously.  A\npaternalistic employer might intend to help women by hiring them only\nfor certain jobs in his company, but, if the employer is motivated by\nunwarranted views about the capabilities of women, he is guilty of\ndirect discrimination.\n\n\nActs of direct discrimination can be unconscious in that the agent is\nunaware of the discriminatory motive behind them.  It is plausible to\nthink that in many societies, unconscious prejudice is a factor in a\nsignificant range of discriminatory behavior, and a viable\nunderstanding of the concept of discrimination must be able to\naccommodate the possibility. In fact, there is growing evidence that\nunconscious discrimination exists (Jost et al. 2009; Payne and Cameron\n2010; and Brownstein and Saul 2016).  And as Wax has noted, even the\nintention to disadvantage persons on account of their group\naffiliation can be unconscious (2008: 983).\n",
