    "main_text": "Constructivism\n4. Constructivism\n\nIntuitionism shares a core part with most other forms of\nconstructivism. Constructivism in general is concerned with\nconstructive mathematical objects and reasoning. From constructive\nproofs one can, at least in principle, extract algorithms that compute\nthe elements and simulate the constructions whose existence is\nestablished in the proof. Most forms of constructivism are compatible\nwith classical mathematics, as they are in general based on a stricter\ninterpretation of the quantifiers and the connectives and the\nconstructions that are allowed, while no additional assumptions are\nmade. The logic accepted by almost all constructive communities is the\nsame, namely intuitionistic logic. \n\nMany existential theorems in classical mathematics have a constructive\nanalogue in which the existential statement is replaced by a statement\nabout approximations. We saw an example of this, the intermediate\nvalue theorem, in the section on weak counterexamples above. Large\nparts of mathematics can be recovered constructively in a similar way.\nThe reason not to treat them any further here is that the focus in\nthis entry is on those aspects of intuitionism that set it apart from\nother constructive branches of mathematics. For a thorough treatment\nof constructivism the reader is referred to the corresponding entry in\nthis encyclopedia.\n",
