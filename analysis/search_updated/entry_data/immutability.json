    "main_text": "\n1. Kinds of Change\n\n\nA change is real if and only if it makes on its own a real difference\nto the world. Real change is (roughly) change involved in causing\nsomething, change an item is caused to undergo or change not\n\u201clogically parasitic\u201d on change in other things. (These\n\u201cor\u201ds are inclusive, not exclusive \u2014 one change can\nsatisfy more than one clause of this account.) Smith's kicking me\ninvolves changes in Smith. Kicking me makes on its own a real\ndifference in Smith. When Smith kicks me, I undergo various changes\nwhich count as real, intuitively \u2014 being kicked makes many real\ndifferences in me. On the other hand, when I become shorter than Smith\nbecause Smith grows, Smith changes really but I do not. Gaining height\nmakes a real difference in Smith, but Smith's gaining height doesn't\nmake a real difference in me. Rather, my becoming shorter than Smith\nin this way is logically parasitic on Smith's growing. It is simply a\nlogical consequence of a real change in something else, not a real\nchange itself.\n\n\nComing at the notion another way, a change is real if and only if\nthere is an absolutely or \u201cbroadly logically\u201d possible world in which\nit is either the only event that occurs in an entire universe or else\nthe sum of all events in a universe, while a change is a\n\u201clogical parasite\u201d if and only if this is not true of\nit. Consider Smith's kicking me. This looks like it could be the only\noccurrence in a universe. It is absolutely or \u201cbroadly logically\u201d\npossible that the universe simply sits there wholly static, then Smith\nkicks me, then the universe winks out of existence before anything\nelse happens. But actually, when we look more carefully, we see that\nin this case, the kick is not the only change. For it has parts which\nare shorter or spatially smaller changes. In the kick, for instance,\nSmith's leg first moves an inch, then another inch, etc., and each\nmovement consists spatially of discrete movements by various\nmuscles. The kick is not the only change, but in the odd universe I\ndescribed, it is the sum of all changes in a universe. No change with\nparts can be the only change in a universe, strictly speaking. On the\nother hand, it is not logically possible that my becoming shorter than\nSmith in the way described occur alone or be a sum of all changes\noccurring in a universe. For it to occur, Smith's growth must also\noccur. And Smith's growth is not a part of it. So changes are real if\nand only if they are logically independent events in the world's\nhistory. If God cannot change really, then, nothing can so act on him\nas to change him, his actions do not change him, and no change in God\ncould be the only event in a universe.  If God cannot change really,\nthen if had there been nothing other than God, there would have been\nno change at all, of any sort.\n\n\nIntrinsic changes are changes like learning or expanding, which\n(roughly) occur entirely within the changing item \u2014 which could\noccur if the universe ended at the item's \u201cskin.\u201d Putting\nthis more carefully, an item x has a property F\nintrinsically just if whether x is F is settled entirely\nby the states of x and x's proper parts (if any), and a\nchange is intrinsic just if its occurring consists entirely in a\nthing's gaining or losing a property had intrinsically. Changes which\nare not intrinsic are extrinsic. All changes in relations to other\nthings are extrinsic. For instance, if a dog moves to my left, I\nbecome a man with a dog on his left. This does not take place wholly\nwithin me; whether it occurs is not settled by my and my parts'\nstates. It also involves the dog, who exists outside me.\n\n\nExtrinsic changes aren't \u201creal\u201d in the sense above. I\nchange extrinsically when a dog comes to be on my left. The dog does\nnot so act on me at to make me have it on my left: the dog does\nnothing to me at all. And my becoming a man with a dog on his left\ncould not be the only event in a universe. For it to happen, a dog\nmust also move. But to say that extrinsic changes aren't\n\u201creal\u201d in the above sense is not to say that they don't\noccur. It is merely to classify them.\n\n\nThe classical and medieval authors who developed DDI did not operate\nwith an explicit classification of changes.  But Anselm, for instance,\nargues both that God is immutable and that His relations with other\nthings can change (Monologion 25) and Aquinas does the same (ST Ia 9\nand 13, 7). So as they understand DDI, it lets God change\nextrinsically. Suppose that at t, Quine begins to worship\nGod. Then at t, God comes to have a new relational property,\nbeing-worshipped-by-Quine. This is clearly an extrinsic change, since\nits occurring in God implies the existence of someone\n\u201coutside\u201d God, namely Quine. God does not (let's say) do\nanything to cause this. It's a matter of Quine's free will. Quine\ndoesn't do anything to God by worshiping him. And this change in God\nis a logical parasite of the real changes in Quine which constitute\nhis beginning to worship God. It's not possible that becoming\nworshipped by Quine be the only change in a universe. Quine's\nbeginning to worship must occur too if this one does. DDI thus lets\nGod become Quine-worshipped. It rules out only real and intrinsic\nchanges.\n\n\nThis raises a question: why do only real, intrinsic changes matter? It\nwould be silly to ascribe to friends of DDI some sort of pre-given\ngeneral antipathy against real, intrinsic change. Disliking such\nchange makes as little sense as disliking universal properties- and\nwhile nominalists campaign endlessly against these, it is not because\nthey have emotional attitudes toward them. Like nominalists, DDI's\nfriends simply followed various specific arguments, discussed below,\nwhere they seemed to lead. And they seemed to lead to a denial that\nGod can change really and intrinsically, but not to a denial of all\ndivine change tout court. The arguments which led\nphilosophers to exempt God from real, intrinsic change all had to do\nwith ways real, intrinsic change or being capable of it might make God\nless perfect. It isn't plausible that extrinsic change or openness to\nit could make something more or less perfect. I am exactly as\nimpressive a man with a dog on my left as I am without a dog on my\nleft, though the dog might improve the scene including me. And I am no\nwhit less impressive for being open to having a dog move nearby.\n2. Immutability vs. Impassibility\n\nDDI is sometimes conflated with the doctrine of divine\nimpassibility, which asserts that nothing external can affect\nGod \u2014 that nothing external can cause God to be in any state, and in\nparticular can cause him to feel negative emotions like grief.\nActually, DDI neither implies nor is implied by divine impassibility.\nSomething could be impassible but mutable if it could change itself,\nbut nothing else could change or affect it. God could be immutable but\npassible. For he could be changelessly aware of events outside himself\n-- perhaps even caused to be aware of them by the events themselves --\nand due to them changelessly feel such responsive emotions as grief.\nBut he would feel them without change, and so always feel them. If\ntemporal, such a God would grieve for us before, while and after we\nsuffer what he grieves for. There is nothing counter-intuitive in\nthis.  It's standard theism to hold that God has full foreknowledge of\nwhat is to befall us: he sees our pain before we feel it, not just\nwhile we feel it, and so grieves it beforehand if He ever grieves it\nat all.  There would be no difference in the quality of God's grief\nbefore and while the pain occurs. For were there anything about it He\ndid not know beforehand, the foreknowledge would not be full, and full\nknowledge beforehand should elicit the same reaction as full knowledge\nduring.  Likewise, it's standard theism to hold that God is\ncognitively perfect.  If he is so and exists in time, He has a past to\nrecall and so has perfect memory. If God perfectly remembers your\npain, it is as fresh for him years later as it was while it occurred,\nand if he perfectly loves you, perhaps he never gets over it. So we\ncan make sense of unchanging grief; if God does grieve, we might well\nexpect it from a God with full foreknowledge, cognitive perfection and\na perfect affective nature. If He is timeless, an immutable but\npassible God would just timelessly suffer for us \u2014 responsively,\ni.e., because of our pain. The case would be just as if God were\ntemporal, save that His knowledge would not be temporally located and\nso would not literally involve either foreknowledge or memory. So\nwhether God is temporal or timeless, DDI implies nothing odd here. And\nit need not \u201cdepersonalize\u201d God as some feel impassibility\nwould.\n\n\nStill, it is surprising that Western theists have held DDI. For\nWestern Scriptures seem to conflict with DDI. Some Scriptural texts\ndepict human sin as making God sadder than he was (e.g., Gen.  6:6),\nthen bringing God to new decisions, e.g., to flood the world.\nAccording to John, \u201cthe Word became flesh\u201d\n(1:14), i.e., God took on a human nature he did not always have. So\nWestern theism's Scriptural roots seem to deny DDI. Yet by the first\ncentury C.E., DDI was central to the main theory of God's nature,\n\u201cclassical theism.\u201d In such \u201cclassical theist\u201d\nwriters as Augustine and Aquinas, being immutable makes God\natemporally eternal (see e.g. Aquinas, ST Ia 9\u201310), and eternality is\nGod's distinctive mode of being. So DDI is at the roots of such\nwriters' understandings of God's nature. And though Scotus and Ockham\nled a revolt against divine atemporality, they and their followers\nmaintained DDI, and it ruled the theological roost till the\n19th century. So one wonders: what made DDI so attractive\nfor so long?\n3. The Case for Immutability\n\n\nFor one thing, the Scriptural witness is not really so clearly on the\nside of divine real intrinsic change. Much that Scripture says of God\nis clearly metaphor. And it is not hard to show that Old Testament\ntexts which ascribe change to God could be speaking metaphorically. As\nI note later, one can parse even the Incarnation in ways which avoid\ndivine real or intrinsic change. Standard Western theism clearly\nexcludes many sorts of change in God. Western theists deny that God\ncan begin or cease to be.  If God cannot, He is immutable with respect\nto existence. Nothing can gain or lose an essential property, for\nnothing can fail to have such a property.  For Western theists, God is\nby nature a spirit, without body. If he is, God cannot change\nphysically \u2014 he is physically immutable. So the Western God\ncould at most change mentally- in knowledge, will, or affect. Further,\nScripture amply supports the claim that God is perfect in knowledge,\nwill, and affect. This perfection seems to rule out many sorts of\nmental change.\n\n\nThis is a broader topic than can be tackled here; instead, let us\nexamine a few examples involving God's knowledge. If perfect in\nknowledge, God is all-knowing. If God learns something new, then\nbefore learning it, he was not all-knowing.  Even if the new fact\ncould not have been foreknown, if He did not know it, He did not know\nall. But only free beings' future actions and what depends on these\nare even\nprima facie beyond God's foreknowledge, and Scripture is full\nof claims that God foreknows free actions. If God's knowledge is\nperfect and includes complete foreknowledge, there is a sort of fact\nabout which God's knowledge is complete and unchanging. Suppose that\ntoday God knows that I will finish this article tomorrow and tomorrow\nGod knows that I am finishing the article. There is a fact\nGod knows both days, that on this particular day, referred to one day\nas \u201ctomorrow\u201d and another as \u201ctoday,\u201d I finish\nthe article. Such facts involve no real tense: they are\n\u2018tenseless\u2019 facts. If God has foreknowledge even of free\ncreaturely actions, he always knows all tenseless facts. It is a small\nstep indeed from divine perfection to necessary divine perfection. For\nit is surely more perfect to be unable not to be perfect than to be\nperfect but able not to be. Again, it is a small step from\nforeknowledge to necessary foreknowledge: the latter would be more\nperfect. (If knowledge must be \u201csafe,\u201d i.e. secure against error in\nvarying conditions, one's knowledge in one respect better if it is\nsafer, and it is maximally safe only if it is the case that\nnecessarily, if p, one knows that p.)  If God's\nknowledge is necessarily perfect, His knowledge of tenseless fact is\nimmutable.  In any possible world in which He knows a tenseless fact,\nHe always knows it, if He is necessarily omniscient.  So it is not\npossible that His knowledge of it change, though if there are possible\nworlds in which it is not a fact, there are possible worlds in which\nHe never knows it. Similarly, if God is necessarily omniscient, He\nimmutably knows all necessary truths.\n\n\nSo God's knowledge of necessary truth and knowledge of tenseless\ncontingent truth looks to be unchangeable, given only a small step\nbeyond Scripture. We can take this a step further. The only sort of\nknowledge we've left out so far is knowledge of tensed contingent\ntruths \u2014 such truths as that tomorrow I will finish the\narticle or yesterday I did finish the article. If God always\nknows the tenseless correlates of these truths \u2014 e.g., that on\nMarch 27, 2002, it is the case that I tenselessly-finish the article\non March 28, 2002 \u2014 then the sheer passage of time accounts for all\nchanges in His contingent knowledge. For which tensed truth God knows\n\u2014 that I will finish, am finishing or did finish \u2014 depends\nsimply on what time it is. So to speak, he never has to learn about\nwhether I finish on March 28; he merely has to learn where in time he\nis in relation to March 28, and this tells him what tensed\npropositions are true about my finishing.  Thus one can make a case on\nwhat are basically Scriptural grounds that God's knowledge changes at\nmost due to the bare passage of time.\n\n\nSo Scriptural considerations suggest a God at least much less\nchangeable than we in some respects. But the roots of the full DDI are\nalso philosophical. In thinking out their views of God's nature,\nWestern philosophers have largely filled out the concept of God by\nascribing to him the properties they thought he must have to count as\nabsolutely perfect. God's perfection seems to rule out many sorts of\nchange, as we've just seen. More general arguments from perfection\nconvinced classical theists that God cannot change in any way.\n\n\nIn Republic II (381b-c), Plato argued for the full DDI. He asserted\nthat a god is \u201cthe\u2026 best possible\u201d in virtue and\nbeauty. Virtue is a perfection of mind. Beauty is a non-mental\nperfection. So Plato's examples are probably meant to do duty for all\nmental and non-mental perfections, i.e. all\nperfections simpliciter. If a god is already the best\npossible in these respects, Plato reasoned, a god cannot change for\nthe better. But being perfect includes being immune to change for the\nworse \u2014 too powerful to have it imposed without permission and\ntoo good to permit it. Thus a god cannot improve or\ndeteriorate. Plato's argument had great historical influence. But it\noverlooked the possibility of changes which neither better nor worsen.\nIf one first knows that it is 11:59:59 and then knows that it is\nmidnight, is one the better or the worse for it? If the best possible\nstate of mind includes omniscience, then perhaps it includes constant\nchange in respects which neither better nor worsen God, e.g., in what\nprecise time God knows it is. Perhaps changes to \u2018keep up\nwith\u2019 time are required by a constant perfection, his\nomniscience. At 11:59:59 it is surely better to know that it is now\n11:59:59, and then at midnight it is better to know that it is now\nmidnight. Plato's argument does not rule out such changes.\n\n\nAristotle also contributed to acceptance of the full DDI. For many\nmedieval theists accepted Aristotle's case for God's existence.\nAristotle's Physics reasoned that if change occurs, it has a\nfinal source, an eternally unchanged changer. Aristotle's De\nCaelo added that something is eternally unchanged only if\nunchangeable. Later theists thought the role of first cause of change\ntoo lofty not to be God's. Writers who took Aristotle's argument or its\ndescendants to prove God's existence found themselves committed to\nDDI.\nAugustine gave a powerful impetus to Christian acceptance of DDI.\nAs he saw it (De trinitate V, 2), a God who gave His very name as \u201cI\nam\u201d and is perfect must be the perfect case of being.  But what can\nchange, Augustine thought, is not a perfect case of being: it does not\nhave its being so securely that it cannot cease to be what it is.\n\n\nBoethius' Consolation of Philosophy (V, 6) also played a role in DDI's\npopularity. He held that being in time must involve at least two\nthings which are defects.  For being temporal, as Boethius saw it,\nentailed having past and future parts of one's life. Temporal beings\nno longer live the past parts of their lives. They do not yet live the\nfuture parts of their lives. Both things are defects, according to\nBoethius. So if God is free of all defects, Boethius reasoned, then\nGod has no past or future. What has no past or future does not\nchange. For what changes goes from what it was to what it then was\ngoing to be, and so has a past and a future. Hence, to Boethius,\nperfection required changelessness. Necessary perfection \u2014 is\nbetter than contingent perfection, and so by perfect-being reasoning\nis God's.  If perfection requires changlessness, necessary perfection\nrequires being immutable. Now Boethius' reasoning requires at least\nsome cleaning up. For a life could be temporal but lack past or future\nparts, if it was instantaneous. And if one's past or future are bad,\nit is not obviously a bad thing not to be living them. But perhaps\nBoethius' argument has some merit. For it would not be a perfection of\nan individual to live for only a single temporal instant. Surely\nlonger would be better, at least if there was a good chance that the\nlonger existence would be overall good. And if God is truly perfect,\nHis life, cannot contain parts it is overall bad to live.\n\n\nBoethius actually followed his reasoning about divine perfection to\nthe conclusion that God exists outside time by his very nature \u2014\nthat God can't be temporal. For whatever has neither past nor future\nis not located in time. But change requires existence in time. Suppose\nthat a turnip, aging, goes from fresh to spoiled. It also then goes\nfrom fresh to not-fresh. So first \u201cthe turnip is fresh\u201d is\ntrue, then \u201cit is not the case that the turnip is fresh\u201d\nis true. The two cannot be true at once. So things change only if they\nexist at at least two distinct times. Hence, if God is necessarily\natemporal \u2014 via necessary divine perfection \u2014 God\nis necessarily changeless, i.e. immutable. Anselm clearly picked\nup Augustine's and Boethius' tie between perfect being and\nimmutability: he wrote in Monologion 28 that God alone exists in an\nunqualified sense and perfectly and absolutely, whereas all other\nthings nearly do not exist at all... For because of his unchangeable\neternity, it can in no way be said of (Him) because of any alteration\nthat he existed or will exist; instead, he exists in an unqualified\nsense.  Nor does he exist changeably, so that he is now something that\nat some time he was not or will not be.  Nor does he fail to be now\nwhat at some other time he was or will be.  Rather, whatever he is, he\nis once and for all, all at once, and illimitably.  And since his\nexistence is like this, he is rightly said to exist in an unqualified\nsense and absolutely and perfectly.\n\n\nAquinas (like Augustine) derived DDI from the deeper classical-theist\ndoctrine of divine simplicity (ST Ia 9). If God is simple, God has no\nparts of any sort. Now when the turnip aged, it became partly\ndifferent \u2014 its smell and texture altered. Were this not so, no\nchange would have occurred. But if the turnip had changed\nin every respect, it would not have been a case of change\neither. For it would have changed with respect to such properties\nas being a turnip and being identical with this\nturnip. And if first we have something identical with this turnip\nand then we have something not identical with this turnip, the turnip\nhas not changed, but disappeared and been replaced by something\nelse. So whatever changes must stay partly the same (else there was\nnot change in one selfsame surviving thing). So only things with parts\nor distinct aspects can change. If so, a simple God cannot\nchange. DDI's connection with divine simplicity and the classical\ntheist theory of God's perfection which centers on divine simplicity\nis one of the deepest reasons for DDI's broad historical appeal; one\ncannot fully explain what moved thinkers to accept DDI without also\ntreating the motivation for the doctrine of divine simplicity. That,\nhowever, is too large a topic to broach here.\n\nDDI, then, has a variety of religious and philosophical roots.\n4. Arguments Against Immutability\n\n\nThere are many arguments against DDI. Al-Ghazali (The Incoherence of\nthe Philosophers, XIII) originated one that was re-invented by Norman\nKretzmann (1966).  We can put a version of it this way:\n\nIf God is omniscient, God knows what time it is now. \n What time it is now is constantly changing.  So\nWhat God knows is constantly changing. (First He knows that it is\nnow t and not now t+1, later He knows that it is now t+1\nand not now t.)  So\nGod is constantly changing. \n\n(2) assumes that presentness is a metaphysically privileged status,\nand what events, times or states of affairs have it is constantly\nshifting: following current jargon, let us call views of time which\nhold this A-theories.  Kretzmann and others who push the argument\nspeak as if there were also a unique universal present, but this is\ninessential: if due to relativity we were to say that there are\ndifferent nows in different places, an omniscient God would have to\nknow what time it is now at all of them.  Some responses to the\nargument deny this assumption: Helm (1988), for instance, suggests\nthat all temporal truths can be expressed by wholly tenseless\npropositions, though he also notes that if one finds this\nunacceptable, he would be content with the claim that for every tensed\nproposition there is a tenseless one that reports the same fact.\n(3) assumes that one knows that p only if one can truly\ntoken \u201cp\u201d to oneself. Aquinas seems to have\nquestioned this.  He reports \u201cancient nominalists\u201d as\ndealing with (1)\u2013(4) by denying (3) \u2014 they claimed that\nwhat God knows is simply an event, the nativity of Christ, and so the\nsentences \u201cChrist was born\u201d and \u201cChrist will be\nborn\u201d signify the same thing, since they signify the same event\n(ST Ia 14, 15 ad 3), and therefore the objects of divine knowledge\nthese sentences express do not differ.  Aquinas objects that the\ndifferences in the sentences cause them to express different\npropositions, and so concedes that it is not true that whatever\nproposition ever expresses what God knows, always expresses what God\nknows.  This, however, does not mean that God's knowledge itself\nchanges, Thomas adds, because He does not know what He knows by\naffirming propositions (ibid.). Rather, His knowledge is a timeless\nintuition which shows that propositions are at one time true and\nanother false (ibid. et De Ver. 2, 5 ad 11; for commentary see\nSullivan 1991). Aquinas, then, might simply deny the tokening\nrequirement, and so (3): he may object not to the nominalist move, but\nto how they get there.\n Hector-Neri Casta\u00f1eda replied to Kretzmann by way of the claim that\n\n P. If x knows that y knows that p, x\n knows that p (1967, 207).\n\n(P) is plausible.  If x knows that y knows that\np, x knows that p is true, since knowledge\nentails truth.  But plausibly, if x knows that p is\ntrue, x knows that p. Suppose, then, that our immutable\nbeing is an atemporal God, seeing time from without. God knows that\nSmith, at t, knows that it is now t.  God knows that\nJones, at t+1, knows that it is now t+1.  By (P), God\natemporally knows both propositions, without having to change \u2014\nthough if we impose the tokening requirement, we have to add that He\ncan token them to Himself only through other sentences than \u201cit\nis now t\u201d and \u201cit is now t+1\u201d: for an\natemporal being cannot truly token either. Swinburne objects: (P) does\nnot just (say) predicate properties of an individual, but presents the\nindividual to x a particular way, and y does not know\nwhat x does unless what y tokens to y presents\nthat individual to y the same way what x tokens to\nx presents it to x (1993, 170\u20131).  However, this reply\nmay equivocate on \u201cwhat y knows.\u201d It is one thing for\nx and y to know the same proposition, and another,\nperhaps, for the proposition to have the same overall cognitive\nsignificance for x and y. A mode of presentation might\naffect overall significance without providing further information that\nmight be stated in a further proposition.  Still, (P) is in fact\nfalse.  If God tells me that He knows the date of the Second Coming, I\nknow that God knows it: He cannot lie, and I know that He is\nomniscient anyway.  But I still do not know the day nor the hour.\n Edward Wierenga (1989, 175\u201390) offered two replies to the\nargument, based on differing accounts of what propositions are\nbelieved and the requirements of omniscience.  On the first, an\nomniscient being would know all truths, propositions expressed by\npresent-tensed sentences predicate properties of whatever time has a\ntime-haecceity T, but they and all other propositions are\neternally true.  Knowers in time have access to the time\nwith T, and perhaps T itself, only at that time: so what\nchanges over time is not what is true, but what temporal believers\nhave access to.  But (Wierenga notes) there is no reason to think that\nan atemporal believer would suffer similar access limits. (After all,\nplausibly it is being in time that imposes them.) So on this account\nthere is no bar to holding that an atemporal believer timelessly knows\nthe same truths temporal believers know only at some times.  In\neffect, Wierenga denies that (2) implies (3): if all truths are\neternally true, what is true does not change. Kvanvig 1986 had made a\nbroadly similar move.\n\nWilliam Craig has argued that this move is incompatible with an\nA-theory of time (2001, 119\u201323). In a sense Wierenga need not\ncare.  He was not aiming to show that omniscience, immutability and an\nA-theory are compatible, but only that omniscience and immutability\nare compatible.  If the conjunction of omniscience, immutability and a\nB-theory is consistent, its members are pairwise consistent, for if\nthere were a contradiction between any two conjuncts, the whole\nconjunction would ipso facto be inconsistent. But in any case, Craig's\ncharge misfires.  This first move is compatible with real passage.\nThe first move entails only that if time passes, passage is not\nrepresented by first one thing and then another being true.  Passage\nis instead represented by something within the overall set of eternal\ntruths- perhaps something as simple as an assertion that time passes,\nor even that each time, when present, is all there is to temporal\nreality.  Passage can also appear in our story as what explains change\nin what we have access to and perhaps in the overall cognitive import\nof our belief-states.  Wierenga's view can allow that the times he\nspeaks of are A-theoretic, existing only when present.  The view\nrequires not that times be tenselessly there but that their\nhaecceities be always and atemporally available.\n\nOn Wierenga's second move, there is no such thing as truth\nsimpliciter. Rather, all truth is truth at a perspective (a pair\n<S, t> of a person and a time).  If I am sitting\nnow but was not sitting at midnight, the second move does not say that\nthe proposition <I am sitting> first was not true and then was.\nRather, it says that <I am sitting> is true at <me, now>\nbut was false at <me, midnight>. Given this machinery, Wierenga\ndefines omniscience this way: x is omniscient just if for all\npropositions p and perspectives <S, t>,\nif p is true at <S, t>, x knows\nthis, and if x is at <S, t> and p is\ntrue at <S, t>, x knows that p. With\nthese moves, it's easy to show that atemporal (and so immutable)\nomniscience is possible if there can be such a thing as an atemporal\nperspective. If so, those pushing (1)\u2013(4) can rule out immutable\nomniscience only if they can provide independent reason to think that\nnecessarily, all perspectives are temporal.  If they have that, of\ncourse, they do not need (1)\u2013(4), because if God is temporal and\npersists, His perspective changes and so what He must know to be\nomniscient changes. Thus (1)\u2013(4) turns out dialectically\nimpotent and otiose.\nCraig claims that recourse to truth-at-a-perspective is\nincompatible with an A-theory (2004, 107). This is so, he thinks,\nbecause propositions true at t must be true simpliciter\nwhen t is the unique objective present. But why think so? Here\nis another A-theoretic view: when t is the unique objective\npresent, all temporal perspectives that actually exist\ninclude t, truths indexed to t are true at all actually\nexisting perspectives, but there is no such thing as truth\nsimpliciter. Unless there is some hidden inconsistency here,\nA-theories do not require truth simpliciter.  Craig claims that\nWierenga's second move too is incompatible with an A-theory (2001,\n2004). But on this move, omniscience does not require that\nperspectives be tenselessly there.  It requires that propositions\nabout them be always and perhaps atemporally available, which one can\nassure by taking \u201ct\u201d as shorthand for \u201csome time with\nhaecceity T\u201d and letting haecceities exist necessarily.\nThe second move works given an A-theory, but has a consequence\nA-theorists may not like. Suppose that time really passes: indeed,\nsuppose presentism, on which only the fleeting present is real.  Then\nfirst <it is now t> is true at those temporal\nperspectives that include t (on presentism, there are no\nothers) and then it is false at all perspectives (on presentism,\nsince t is now past, there are only temporal perspectives in\nwhich it is false).  But at an atemporal perspective, it is never true\nthat it is now t, for any t.  There is no time it is in\neternity; if there were, eternality would not be an atemporal mode of\nbeing.  So at an atemporal perspective, time simply does not pass,\nthere is nothing about passage to know, and this is why passage poses\nno problem for immutable omniscience. Passage is real in time, then,\nbut not at an atemporal perspective.  Requiring an atemporal being to\nknow that it is now noon to count as omniscient is like requiring\nsomeone at midnight to know that it is now noon to count as\nomniscient: what is not true at one's perspective is not knowable then\neither.\nOf course, one wants to know how to make sense of the idea that\npassage is real only in time. Stump and Kretzmann (1981) gave a take\non this while retracting Kretzmann's original commitment to\n(1)\u2013(4).  Suppose presentism.  On the Stump-Kretzmann picture,\neach time t, when present, is \u201cET-simultaneous\u201d with the life of an\neternal being.  So that life is ET-simultaneous with t. So all times,\nprecisely in their presentness, are just ET-simultaneous with an\neternal life. But in an eternal life, nothing passes.  If it did, that\nlife would have earlier and later parts: it would be temporal, not\neternal.  So in God's eternal life, each time, precisely in its\npresentness, remains: nothing ever ceases to be ET-simultaneous with\nGod's life, for that would entail an earlier and a later simultaneous\nto God's life, and so in God's life.  So while times pass in time,\nthey do not pass relative to eternity.  Leftow (1991) offers a broadly\nsimilar picture, but works with a differently-defined\nsimultaneity-relation.\n\nKretzmann's argument is simply that an omniscient being must be\n\u201csubject to change\u201d (1966, 410): he does not sort changes as intrinsic\nand extrinsic.  One of his examples of change induced by a change in\nwhat is known is clearly an extrinsic change (1966, 411).\n\n\nSo one reply is that knowing the correct time is not an intrinsic\nstate of God's, and so change with respect to it would not contradict\nDDI. Intrinsic states are those settled entirely within one's own\nskin. But then unless p is a truth entirely about matters\nwithin one's own skin, knowing that p is not an intrinsic\nstate. For that one knows that p rather than believes falsely\nthat p only if p is true, and if p is not a\ntruth entirely about matters within one's own skin, whether p\nis true is at least partly settled by matters outside one's own skin.\nBut when it is now is not a matter settled within God's own skin. What\ntime it is now is not a fact about God alone. It is a fact about time,\nwhich is not God, and also about the entire temporal\nuniverse. Further, it arguably is not the case even that what is\nwithin God's skin settles what time it is in the sense that were\nnothing else than God to exist, facts about God would suffice to\ndetermine what time it is. For this would be at best a contentious\nclaim, as it implies that God would be in time if he existed alone,\nwithout a universe. Many would say that time is an aspect of the\nphysical universe \u2014 no universe, no time either. Moreover, even\nif God existed alone and were then in time, knowing what time it is\nwould not be a temporally intrinsic matter. God knows that it\nis now t just at t. So knowing the correct time\nat t is temporally intrinsic only if it does not entail the\nexistence or occurrence of anything that exists at other times. But\nfor any time after the first instant (if there was one), knowing what\ntime it is involves knowing the temporal distance between the present\ntime and some other time: knowing that it is noon, April 16, 2002,\nimplies knowing a relation between that time and date and the date\ntraditionally assigned to the birth of Christ. Thus knowing what time\nit is entails knowing that there was some time other than the present\n\u2014 a time outside the period in which God knows that it is now\nthis time. Knowing what time it is at any time after the first instant\nthus is not a temporally intrinsic state. And if this is so, it is\nhard to see why even knowledge that it is time's first instant would\nbe. Thus the objection has a false premise. If God's cognitive state\nwith respect to what time it is changed, it would not follow from this\nthat he is not intrinsically immutable. This result may seem\na bit hard to swallow. One wants to know how a change in\nknowledge could fail to be an intrinsic change. One answer might\nappeal to externalist theories of mental content. On these, my\nknowledge that p is a complex consisting of my inner mental\nstate plus certain items in the world. Perhaps God's knowledge that it\nis now t is something like a complex consisting of God's\ninner cognitive state and an external component, t. If it is,\nperhaps the only change involved when God first knows that it is now\nt and then knows that it is now t* (> t)\nis the change from t to t*.\n\n\nOther arguments against DDI appeal to Scripture's depiction of God\nas changing, e.g., in the Flood story. Facing such texts, DDI's friends\ndefuse the appearance of divine change by appeal to doctrines less\nspeculative and theoretical than DDI. Thus Philo argues from God's\nforeknowledge of the future and constancy of character that God cannot\nrepent or feel regret, as the Flood story suggests. The Incarnation is\nan especially knotty problem for DDI's Christian friends. In general,\nthese argue that all change it involved occurred in the human nature\nGod the Son assumed rather than in God; God was eternally ready to be\nincarnate, and eternally had those experiences of the earthly Christ\nwhich the Incarnation makes part of his life. Through changes in Mary\nand the infant she bore, what was eternally in God eventually took\nplace on earth.\n\n\nAnother argument against DDI appeals to God's power. Before\nCreation, God could assure that no universe ever existed. God has this\npower now only if he can alter the past. Few think he can. So events\nseem to change God's power. DDI's defenders reply that any change here\nis purely extrinsic. God has the power he always has. He has lost a\nchance to use it, and so we no longer want to call his power a\npower to prevent a universe. But God is intrinsically as able as ever\nto do so.\nSwinburne has argued that immutability is incompatible with acting\nfreely, writing that an \u201cagent is perfectly free at a certain time if\nhis action results from his own choice at that time and if his choice\nis not itself brought about by anything else.  Yet a person immutable\nin the strong sense would be unable to perform any action at a certain\ntime other than what he had previously intended to do.  His course of\naction being fixed by his past choices, he would not be perfectly\nfree\u201d (1993, p. 222).  One thing to note here is that if my past\nchoices fix my present choice, it does not follow that they bring it\nabout.  It may only follow that it is inevitable that I myself bring\nthat choice about at that time.  So it is not at all clear that\nimmutability is incompatible even with Swinburnean perfect freedom.\nMore importantly, Swinburne's \u201cperfect freedom\u201d is a particularly\ndemanding notion.  Even if my own past choices do bring about my\npresent choice, many libertarians would allow that my present choice\nis derivatively free and responsible if the past choices that brought\nit about were libertarian-free (see e.g. Kane 1996, Stump 1996,\nEkstrom 2000).  Most theists would be quite content with a God with\nfull libertarian freedom.\n\n\nA final objection goes thus: God does change extrinsically. Even\nfull DDI grants this. But whatever changes extrinsically is in time.\nFor different things are true of it at different times, even if the\n\u2018real\u2019 changes due to which this is so are in other things.\nAnd whatever is in time changes intrinsically \u2014 it grows older. So DDI\nis false. Some would reply by denying that growing older is an\nintrinsic change. A more controversial response might be to deny even\nextrinsic change to God. This can be done by holding that God is\natemporal. For if God exists at t and at a later t*,\nand, at t, p is true of him and, at t*,\np is false of him, he does change extrinsically. He bears\ndifferent relations to proposition p, at least. If God is\natemporal, he exists neither at t nor at t* \u2014 his\nexistence is not temporally located. If this is so, there are never two\ntimes such that different things are true of him at different times.\nRather, all that is ever true of him is true of him timelessly. But a\nthing changes, even extrinsically, only if different things are true of\nit at different times. Perhaps, then, defending DDI requires commitment\nto divine timelessness.\n",
