    "main_text": "Ontological: Moral Facts and Moral Naturalism || Natural Facts\n3.3 Natural Facts\n\n\nMoral naturalism (as a form of cognitivism) maintains that, while a\ndistinction can be drawn between moral facts and other kinds of facts,\nmoral facts are among the natural facts of the world. An advantage of\nthis position for explaining the possibility of moral knowledge is that\nnearly everyone who rejects global skepticism grants that knowledge of\nnatural facts is possible. The moral naturalist, therefore, is in a\nposition to argue that moral knowledge should not be more problematic\nthan other kinds of knowledge of the natural world. A moral naturalist\ncan, moreover, reply to the charge that moral facts are redundant for\nexplaining the facts of the natural world by pointing out that the\nburden of proof is on the critic to demonstrate that those natural\nfacts that are also moral facts have no explanatory power. Certainly\nthey cannot be said to lack explanatory power for the reason that they\nare not part of the natural world. Nor can they be said to be\ninaccessible to empirical study, since as part of the natural world\nthey are knowable through experience (Copp 1995, p. 27).\n3.3.1 Identity, supervenience, and redundancy\n\n\nIt is important, however, to distinguish in this regard between two\ndifferent kinds of moral naturalism. One kind maintains that moral\nproperties are identical with certain natural properties specified by\ncombinations of non-moral terms found in the natural and social\nsciences (Brandt 1979, Railton 1986, Copp 1995). To take an\noversimplified example, suppose that the property of being a wrong act\nis identical with the property of having as a consequence a lower\nquotient of pleasure over pain for all affected by the act than an\nalternative act would. Here a moral property of being a wrong act is\nheld to be one and the same property as a complex utilitarian property\nspecified in the non-moral terms of consequence, pleasure, and pain.\nGiven this identity, an act having this moral property cannot be less\nopen to empirical study nor can it have less explanatory power than an\nact\u2019s having the property of not maximizing pleasure over pain. For\ninstance, if a group avoids a certain kind of action, the correct\nexplanation, given the identity and the role of pleasure and pain in\nlearning, could be that this kind of act is wrong. Whether it is or not\nwould be an empirical question.\n\n\nThe situation is more complex, however, for the other form of moral\nnaturalism. It maintains that moral facts are natural facts but denies\nthat they are specifiable using the language of the natural and social\nsciences (Kim 1978, Sturgeon 1985, Brink 1989). Moral facts are said to\nbe natural facts in that they are discoverable empirically and provide\ncausal explanations of events in the natural world. At the same time,\nthey are a unique category that defies identification in non-moral\nterms. As such, they raise again the issue of redundancy. Do we really\nneed this special category of natural facts in order to understand the\nnatural world? In this view some natural facts are supposed to\nsupervene on others. That is to say, moral facts are dependent\non distinct natural facts specifiable in non-moral terms in the\nfollowing way: if the moral facts were otherwise, necessarily the\ndistinct non-moral facts on which they depend would have to be\ndifferent. Take a deliberate act of cruelty done just for fun. This act\nis wrong in virtue of being a deliberate act of cruelty done just for\nfun. The fact that it is a wrong act and the fact that it is\ndeliberately cruel done for fun are distinct facts, but the first\ndepends on the second. Necessarily, if what was done had not been wrong,\nit would not have been a deliberate act of cruelty done for fun. Once\nthis relation of supervenience is recognized, it is possible to defend\nthe non-redundancy of moral facts by pointing out parallel relations of\nsupervenience in the non-moral natural world and arguing that the\nredundancy objection proves too much, asking us to reject other\nnon-moral categories that appear ontologically sound. For example,\ngenetic facts obtaining at the cellular level are said to supervene on\ngenetic facts at the molecular level without one being simply identical\nwith the other (Kitcher 1984), yet it would be absurd from a scientific\nperspective to deny the existence of facts at the cellular level.\nWhether this defense is ultimately successful remains to be seen, but\nat the present time it is far from clear that either form of naturalism\ncan be rejected on grounds of redundancy (Sayre-McCord 1988).\n3.3.2 Reasoning from experience?\n\n\nWe began with an objection to moral naturalism that applies as well\nto moral non-naturalism, noting that the former is in a better position\nto meet it. Let us now direct our attention to an important objection\nthat applies specifically to moral naturalism. Kant argues\n(Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals, Chapter 2, paragraph\nfive) that moral knowledge cannot be based on experience of the natural\nworld. We might interpret one of his arguments as having the following\nstructure. (a) If we have moral knowledge at all, we must know a\ngeneral moral truth from which we can deduce specific conclusions. But\n(b) we could know this general truth on the basis of experience only by\ngeneralizing from examples of right and wrong that we encounter in\nexperience. Consider then, as a specific example, an act of deliberate\ncruelty done for fun. How would we know that this is a wrong act or a\nright act? We must infer it from a general moral truth, according to\n(a), but to explain how we know a general moral truth, we must, given\n(b), experience specific examples of right and wrong, and now we are\nback where we began. To avoid this circle, we must assume that we know\na priori that some act or kind of act is wrong. In general, it follows that\nno moral knowledge is based solely on experience. Moral naturalism\ncannot, therefore, provide an appropriate ontology for moral\nknowledge.\n\n\nKant\u2019s argument is particularly powerful because the assumptions on\nwhich it is built are fairly weak, indeed much weaker than they might\nat first appear to be. At times Kant argues that moral knowledge cannot\nbe based on experience because it requires knowledge of absolutely\nuniversal truths that transcend all earthly experience, but this\nargument does not need that strong assumption. In fact, the argument\nwould work even if (contrary to Kant) the most basic moral principle\nhas many exceptions and is true only some of the time. Arguably we\nwould still need to appeal to examples if we are to learn from\nexperience when the principle applies and when it doesn\u2019t, and then we\nwould need some way to determine the moral status of the examples. But,\nagain, it would be question begging to assume that knowledge of their\nmoral status comes from experience rather than a priori, since the\npossibility of this is what is at issue.\n\n\nThe essence of the argument can be put in more general terms. Both\nforms of moral naturalism entail that facts that are specifiable in\nnon-moral terms determine the moral facts, where the determination\ninvolves either identity or else supervenience without identity. But\nwhich moral facts do they determine? Most philosophers will grant that\nnatural facts (or properties) that are specifiable non-morally can be\nexperienced. The problem is in making the step from the latter kind of\nfact to a moral fact just to establish the moral fact in\neven one example. Appeal to experience, it may seem, cannot completely\naccount for this step without circularity.\n\n\nA difficulty for the argument, however, is that it turns on a narrow\nconception of reasoning from experience. The argument assumes that\nreasoning from experience must begin with clear cases of knowledge, at\nleast regarding the things observed in experience, and then infer more\ngeneral knowledge. This way of thinking about empirical reasoning has\na long tradition and was dominant among empiricist philosophers in the\nfirst half of the twentieth century. In the second half, thinking\nabout reasoning in science changed dramatically. One prominent\nalternative view is that general hypotheses offer explanations of\nexperience, and that we reason from experience by inferring the best\nexplanation of our data against a background of theoretical\nassumptions that are subject to tests on other occasions and in other\ncontexts. Two important differences are that we don\u2019t begin with firm\nknowledge and, second, that we rely on background information to\ndetermine the best explanation. The relevance for moral knowledge is\nclear enough. We can begin with mere moral beliefs and feelings\n(rather than moral knowledge) yet reason to a conclusion implying\nmoral knowledge if the conclusion provides the best explanation of the\nbeliefs and feelings (Sturgeon 1985). Since the starting points are\nnot assumed to be cases of moral knowledge, the problem of circularity\ndoes not arise in the way implied by the above argument. Whether the\nbackground information contains moral knowledge is a further issue (to\nbe taken up in section 5), but nothing in this alternative conception\nof reasoning from experience necessitates that the reasoning assumes\nmoral knowledge. Unless this alternative conception can be eliminated,\nthe Kantian argument is at best inconclusive.\n3.3.3 The naturalistic fallacy and the open question argument\n\n\nThe last suggestion turns on a step in reasoning that moves from\nfacts that can be specified non-morally and are taken on all sides to\nbe open to empirical study to moral facts. This step has been claimed\nby numerous philosophers to be a fallacious step in deductive\nreasoning. Some of these philosophers hold that the moral claims are\nnot true or false and hence cannot express moral knowledge (Ayer 1946,\nStevenson 1944 and 1963, Hare 1952 and 1981, Gibbard 1990, Blackburn\n1984 and1998). Others, such as Kant and G. E. Moore, hold that moral\nknowledge is possible but not deducible from experience of the natural\nworld. Moore\u2019s argument, however, is worth considering in its own\nright, since it has had significant influence since he first\narticulated it in 1903 and differs from Kant\u2019s. For Moore, what would\nhave to be the case to allow the reasoning to go through would be the\nidentity of a moral property with a property specifiable in terms\ndescribing the natural world. For example, if the property of being\nmorally good is the same as the property of being pleasurable, then\nfrom the empirically ascertainable fact that an activity is pleasurable\none can deduce that the activity is morally good. Moore thought,\nhowever, that no naturalistically specifiable property, such as being\npleasurable, could possibly be the same as a moral property. In fact,\nhis position was more general. He called it a \u201cnaturalistic fallacy\u201d to\nsuppose that a moral property is the same as some natural property,\nhowever the latter property might be specified. In his language, moral\nnaturalism, in either to the two forms considered, would be an example\nof the naturalistic fallacy.\u00a0\n\n\nIt is worth noting an important respect in which Moore\u2019s argument\ndiffers from Kant\u2019s. While Kant\u2019s argument is about the nature of\nreasoning to moral conclusions, Moore\u2019s is focused directly on the\nidentity of moral properties, however they might be known. Moore thinks\nthat moral properties are not natural and therefore cannot be known by\nexperience. Kant, reasoning in the reverse, thinks that moral\nproperties cannot be known by experience and hence cannot be natural\nproperties. Since natural properties are known through experience and\nat issue is whether moral properties are natural properties, it is easy\nto miss this critical difference. Whether Moore\u2019s reasons for thinking\nthat moral properties are not natural turn out to be good reasons, he\nsucceeded in focusing the debate on the strictly ontological issue of\nidentity.\n\n\nWhy does Moore think that the identity in question is impossible,\napart from our methods of reasoning? Moore\u2019s answer is his \u201copen\nquestion argument\u201d (Moore, 1903). Moore reasons, if the identity\nillustrated in the last example were to hold, it would be odd to ask,\n\u201cI know this activity is pleasurable, but is it morally\ngood?\u201d After all, if being pleasurable just is the property of\nbeing morally good, then to ask this would be like asking, \u201cI\nknow this activity is pleasurable, but is it pleasurable?\u201d Since\nthe original question is \u201copen,\u201d rather than silly or\nself-answering, the identity must not obtain. Since exactly the same\npoint can be made regarding any putative identity between a moral\nproperty and a natural property, Moore concludes that no such identity\nis possible.\n\n\nThe open question argument has not been persuasive for several\nreasons. Two are especially notable. Moore\u2019s target was the moral\nnaturalist who thought that the identities in question might be\nestablished on the basis of conceptual analysis. It has been pointed\nout, however, that the question might still be open for someone\nprovided that this person is not aware of the identity, not having\ncarried out the analysis (Brandt 1959). Current versions of moral\nnaturalism, moreover, do not propose that the identity would be known\nby a priori reasoning. The identity is conceived instead to be\nanalogous to those identities discovered in the sciences, such as the\nidentity claimed to exist between genes and strings of DNA or the\nwell-accepted identity between water and H2O. Obviously, whether genes\nare DNA or whether water is H2O have been open questions at one time.\nIn the case of DNA the question is still open for some. The reason is\nthat these identities are established a posteriori. Perhaps Moore is\nright to deny the putative identity, but his open question argument\nfails to establish that he is.\n3.3.4 Moral reasoning from the first-person perspective\n\n\nDespite the failure of Moore\u2019s argument, the question of the\nidentity of moral properties with natural properties remains a hotly\ncontested issue. Many believe that if Moore gave the wrong reason for\ndisputing the possibility of these identities, he was still right to\ndraw our attention to the apparent difference between a property that\ndescribes a natural feature of the world and a property that has\nprescriptive or normative significance for us. The latter tells us how\nthings ought to be rather than telling us how things are. How could\nproperties that play such different roles in our reflections about the\nworld be the same?\n\n\nThis question may be interpreted in different ways. We might\nemphasize the immediate relevance of moral properties for our\nmotivation to act, contrasting it with the merely indirect relevance of\nnatural properties. This interpretation, however, would take us back to\nthe debate between internalists and externalists that we have already\nexplored. A quite different interpretation focuses on the perceived\nrole of moral properties in moral reflection and judgment from the\nperspective of someone engaged in moral reflection and judgment. Two\ncases are particularly relevant. Suppose, to take Harman\u2019s example,\nthat I suddenly see hoodlums setting a cat on fire (Harman 1977). I may\nform an immediate judgment, without any conscious reflection, that what\nthey are doing is wrong. In another case I may find myself perplexed\nabout whether euthanasia is wrong and begin to reflect on why I should\nregard it one way or another. Each case presents an apparently strong\ncontrast to the style of thinking that engages me if I were suddenly to\nrecognize the presence of a cat or were to reflect on whether a certain\ncontested property of a natural system really exists. Let us explore\nthese cases in turn.\n\n\nWhen we make an immediate moral judgment that the hoodlums are doing\nwrong, we might be said to be making an inference, however unconscious.\nWe infer from our belief that the hoodlums are engaged in an act of\ncruelty, done for fun, that what they are doing is wrong. Grant for the\nsake of argument that there is an inference here. Clearly it is not an\ninductive inference, such as an inference to the best explanation of\ntheir setting the cat on fire. The judgment that their act is wrong\ndoes not explain what they are doing, nor would we likely say that\ntheir torturing the cat for fun provides empirical evidence that they are doing\nwrong. Our thinking in this case simply does not resemble, at least not\nas seen from the inside, anything like an inductive inference, as the\nidentity thesis of moral naturalism would appear to require. Moreover,\nif someone did not reach the conclusion that the hoodlums were acting\nwrongly, even though she believed that they were torturing the cat for\nfun, we would think her guilty of moral insensitivity. We would not\ncharge her with having made some perceptual error or a mistake in\nreasoning. The latter could be appropriate criticism, however, if she\nwere making an inductive inference based on her perception. The kind of\ncriticism that is appropriate for failing to make the correct judgment\nis different in each case, contrary to what we should expect if the\nidentity thesis is true.\n\n\nThe objections here may not be decisive, however. (See Copp 2000 for\nthe following rebuttal.) The best explanation of how we reason in\njudging the hoodlums to be doing wrong is that we think in general that\nacts of deliberate cruelty done for fun are wrong and subsume this case\nunder that general rule. The moral judgment is the result of a simple\ninference from the fact that the hoodlums are committing such an act.\nFor this reason our thinking contrasts sharply with inductive\nreasoning. We are, in fact, reasoning deductively. It is important to\nnotice, however, that although our reasoning is deductive, nothing says\nthat the premises of our reasoning are not empirical. Similar reasoning\noccurs frequently in science. I may notice a copper wire and\nimmediately infer that it conducts electricity on the basis of my\nknowledge that in general copper is a good conductor of electricity.\nThe main premise is obviously empirical, even though I am reasoning\ndeductively. Such examples are a dime a dozen. The example need not,\ntherefore, force us to the conclusion that non-inductive reasoning in\nthe moral case is different in some basic way. Analogues to moral\nsensitivity exist in cases where people\u2019s interests and training make\nthem sensitive to horticultural, fiscal, and emotional facts. Moral\nsensitivity is a heightened tendency to notice morally relevant\nfeatures of situations. But some people have a heightened awareness of\nplants or financial trends or the emotional states of others. We do not\nwant to conclude that these objects of heightened awareness are not\nnatural features of the world.\n\n\nConsider finally the case where we are puzzling about the morality\nof euthanasia. If we are puzzled, we do not leap to a conclusion.\nInstead we reflect upon similar examples and general moral principles,\ntrying to arrive at a balanced view of the morally relevant features of\nthe case at hand. Perhaps there are analogues to how we would behave\nwhen puzzled about a scientific question. Notice, however, that most\npeople would not engage in the type of investigation that we should\nexpect if moral wrongness were a property that is identical to a\ncomplex natural property whose presence is open to empirical study.\nConsider the following summary account of the natural property that\nCopp takes to be identical to that of being wrong. On his theory to\nclaim that something is wrong is to ascribe to it the property of\nviolating a standard or norm that would be a justified moral standard\nfor the relevant society. \u201cA moral standard is relevantly justified\njust in case (roughly) its currency in the social code of the relevant\nsociety would best contribute to the society\u2019s ability to meet its\nneeds \u2014 including its needs for physical continuity, internal harmony\nand co-operative interaction, and peaceful and co-operative relations\nwith its neighbors.\u201d (Copp 2000, pp. 47\u20138) Surely, when people engage\nin moral reflection to resolve their puzzlement about a moral issue,\nthey do not attempt an empirical study of the kind that would be called\nfor if the puzzlement were about whether this complex natural property\nobtains.\n\n\nThe general objection, it should be stressed, is not limited to\nCopp\u2019s theory. The objection can be put equally forcefully for any of\nthe other prominent theories of moral naturalism. Copp has a rebuttal,\nhowever, that would apply generally for the other naturalistic moral\ntheories that entail an identity of the kind under attack. Consider a\npiece of paper that has the property of being a U.S. dollar bill. To\nstate in the terms of economic theory the truth conditions for a piece\nof paper having this property would be a task beyond the competence of\nmost people. It would involve minimally the dispositions of relevant\nofficials and the rest of the U.S. population to exchange goods and\nservices for the price of one dollar. The task would not end here,\nhowever, since we would need to spell out in empirically testable terms\nwho counts as a relevant official, who counts as part of the U.S.\npopulation, and what it means for something to be \u201cpriced at one\ndollar.\u201d On the other hand, most people would know whether a piece of\npaper is a U.S. one dollar bill and would know it at once just by\ninspection. Moral naturalists can contend, indeed, that most people on\nseeing a U.S. dollar bill would arrive correctly and reliably at the\nconclusion that it is one. Moreover, they would be able do this as\neasily as they would conclude correctly and reliably that the hoodlums\nare doing something horribly wrong on seeing them set a cat on fire\n(Copp 2000).\n\n\nNow imagine that we are puzzled about whether a piece of paper is a\nU.S. one dollar. Perhaps we have heard on the radio that counterfeit\nU.S. one dollar bills have been recently exchanged in our neighborhood.\nWe would try to compare it to bills that have come from elsewhere that\nwe are sure are not counterfeit or perhaps get the advice of an expert.\nWe would likely not, however, appeal to the general theoretical\nidentity mentioned earlier and attempt to verify the authenticity of\nthe bill by reference to it. We should, it can thus be argued, reject\nthe inference that identities of the kind in question do not exist\nbecause we would not appeal to them when we are puzzled about specific\ncases. The non-moral analogue undermines the inference from the case of\neuthanasia. The identities can come into play when foundational issues\nare raised. If the question is whether to devalue the U.S. dollar or\nwhether it should be tied to the gold standard, then the theoretical\nspecification of what constitutes a U.S. dollar may come into play and\nmay be important to explain the force of certain arguments pro or con.\nBut, similarly, the moral naturalist can argue that for foundational\nmoral issues, such as whether animals or human fetuses have rights, the\ntheoretical identities, concerning say what it is for something to have\na moral right, become directly relevant to discussion. In sum, unless\nthe non-moral cases can be shown to be disanalogous to the moral ones,\nthe objection does not defeat moral naturalism.\n",
