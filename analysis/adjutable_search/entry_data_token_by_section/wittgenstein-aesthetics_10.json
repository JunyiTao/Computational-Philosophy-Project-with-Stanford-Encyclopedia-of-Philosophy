    "main_text": "The Comparative Approach || Seeing Connections\n3.2 Seeing Connections\n\n\nBeneath Wittgenstein's examples, as developed throughout these\nlectures, lies another interest (which presses its way to the surface\nand becomes explicit on occasion): he is eager to show the\nsignificance of making connections in our perception and understanding\nof art works\u2014connections between the style of a poet and that of\na composer (e.g. Keller and Brahms), between one musical theme and\nanother, between one expressive facial depiction and another, between\none period of an artist's work and another. Such connections\u2014we\nmight, reviving a term from first-generation Wittgensteinians, refer\nto the kind of work undertaken to identify and articulate such\nconnections as \u201cconnective analysis\u201d\u2014are, for\nWittgenstein, at the heart of aesthetic experience and aesthetic\ncontemplation. And they again are of the kind that reductive causal\nexplanation would systematically miss. In attempting to describe\nsomeone's feelings, could we do better than to imitate the way the\nperson actually said the phrase we found emotionally revelatory,\nWittgenstein pointedly asks? The disorientation we would feel in\ntrying to describe the person's feeling with subtlety and precision\nwithout any possibility of imitating his precise expressive\nutterance\u2014\u201cthe way he said it\u201d \u2013 shows how\nvery far the dualistic or subtractive conceptual template is from our\nhuman experience, our natural history.\n\n\nConnections, of the kind alluded to here\u2014a web of\nvariously-activated relations between the particular aspect of the\nwork to which we are presently attending and other aspects, other\nparts of the work, or other works, groups of works, or other artists,\ngenres, styles, or other human experiences in all their\nparticularity\u2014may include what we call associations awakened by\nthe work, but connections are not reducible to them only (and\ncertainly not to undisciplined, random, highly subjective, or free\n associations).[7]\n The impossibility of the simplifying subtractive template emerges\nhere as well: \u201cSuppose [someone says]: \u2018Associations are\nwhat matter\u2014change it slightly and it no longer has the same\nassociations\u2019. But can you separate the associations from the\npicture, and have the same thing?\u201d The answer is clearly, again\nlike the case of the singing with and then without expression above,\nnegative: \u201cYou can't say: \u2018That's just as good as the\nother: it gives me the same associations\u2019\u201d (Wittgenstein\n1966, 34). Here again, Wittgenstein shows the great gulf that\nseparates what we actually do with, what we actually say about, works\nof art, and how we would speak of them if the conceptual\npictures and templates with which he has been doing battle were\ncorrect. To extend one of Wittgenstein's examples, we would very\nmuch doubt the aesthetic discernment, and indeed the sympathetic\nimagination and the human connectedness, of a person who said of two\npoems (each of which reminded him of death) that either will do as\nwell as the other to a bereaved friend, that they would do the same\nthing (where this is uttered in a manner dismissive of nuance, or as\nthough it is being said of two detergents). Poetry, Wittgenstein is\nshowing, does not play that kind of role in our lives, as the nature\nand character of our critical verbal interactions about it\nindicate. And he ascends, momentarily, to a remark that characterizes\nhis underlying philosophical methodology (or one dimension of it) in\nthe philosophy of language that is being put to use here within the\ncontext of his lectures on aesthetics: \u201cIf someone talks bosh,\nimagine the case in which it is not bosh. The moment you imagine it,\nyou see at once it is not like that in our case\u201d (Wittgenstein\n1966, 34). The gulf that separates what we should say if the\ngeneralizing templates were accurate from what we in actual\nparticularized cases do say could further call into question not only\nthe applicability or accuracy, but indeed the very intelligibility, of\nthe language used to express those templates, those explanatory\npictures. Wittgenstein leaves that more aggressive, and ultimately\nmore clarifying and conceptually liberating, critique for his work on\nlanguage and mind in Philosophical Investigations (1958) and\nother writings, but one can see from these lectures alone how such an\naggressive critique might be undertaken.\n",
