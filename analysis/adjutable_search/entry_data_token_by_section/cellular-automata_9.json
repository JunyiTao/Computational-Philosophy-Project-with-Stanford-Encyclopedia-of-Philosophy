    "main_text": "Some Basic Notions and Results || Further CA\n2.7 Further CA \n\nNotwithstanding the historical and conceptual centrality of the CA\ndescribed in this section, many important developments in the field\ncould not be presented in the space allowed for this entry. One can\nrelax some of the assumptions in the general characterization of CA\nprovided in\n Section 2.1\n and get interesting results. The transition rule can be\nprobabilistic and take into consideration more than just one\ntime step (see Richards, Meyer, & Packard 1990: probabilistic\nautomata are widely used to represent the stochastic dynamics of\nmicrophysical systems); the cell state updating can be\nasynchronous (see Ingerson & Buvel 1984); the lattice can\nbe made of non-homogeneous cells following different\ntransition rules (see Kauffman 1984); even the discreteness constraint\ncan be relaxed by having the set of states be the set of real\nnumbers (see Wolfram 2002: 155\u2013157).\n\nCA are also being fruitfully used in connection to the issue of the\nthermodynamic limits of computation: is there a minimum amount of\nenergy needed to perform a logical operation? Landauer (1961) argued\nthat irreversible logical operations (i.e., operations that, not\ncorresponding to bijections, cannot be run backwards as they entail\nsome information loss) necessarily dissipate energy. The invention of\nthe Fredkin reversible logical gate and of the Billiard Ball Model of\nreversible computation (Fredkin & Toffoli 1982) strengthened the\nimportance of the link between universal reversible automata and the\nphysical properties of computation (for an overview, see Ilachinski\n2001: 309\u2013323; for a sample reversible CA, see Berto, Rossi,\n& Tagliabue 2016).\n\nIn recent years, the growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a\nprominent sub-field in computer science led to interesting\ncontamination between AI and CA. On the one hand, prominent AI\nresearchers explicitly mentioned contributions from the complex system\nliterature \u2013 such as CA \u2013 as alternative ways to model\ncollective behavior (Ha & Tang 2022). On the other, traditional\nCA-based modeling has been extended to leverage the \u201cpowerful\nlanguage of loss functions\u201d (Mordvintsev et al. 2020) for\ndifferentiable rules, and take advantage of the extensive tooling\nbuilt for gradient-based numerical optimization: CA built on top of\nneural networks showcase (learned) asynchronous rules (Mordvintsev et\nal.  2020) for morphogenesis, as well as (learned) variable\nneighborhood composition (Grattarola et al. 2021). \n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that genetic algorithms have\nbeen used with CA to study how evolution creates computation (for a\nsurvey of important results, see Mitchell, Crutchfield, & Das\n1996). While the aforementioned sources further explore these\npossibilities, the sample CA models discussed so far will be\nsufficient for the philosophical arguments we are going to address\nhenceforth.\n",
