    "main_text": "Metaphysics || The Subject of Metaphysics\n6.1 The Subject of Metaphysics\n\nIt was well known among the scholastics that Avicenna and Averroes\ndisagreed about the subject matter of metaphysics. In the two opening\nchapters of his Metaphysics, Avicenna argues that no science\ncan demonstrate the existence of its proper subject, and that hence\nGod, whose existence is proven in metaphysics, cannot be its proper\nsubject. The subject (maw\u1e0d\u016b\u02bf, subiectum) of\nmetaphysics is being as being. What is sought after\n(ma\u1e6dl\u016bb, quaesitum) in metaphysics, is\nthat which unconditionally accompanies being: such as the causes of\nbeing, among which God is the first. Averroes countered that the\nexistence of the first principle cannot be demonstrated in\nmetaphysics, since such a proof can only begin with God\u2019s\neffects and with movement in particular. This is why the proof of God\nbelongs to physics. The subject matter of metaphysics is separable\nbeings, among which counts God, as Averroes argues in the Long\nCommentary on the Physics (ch. I.83, but in other works he\nassigns this function to being as being; see Bertolacci 2007).\n\nMost scholastic authors favoured Avicenna\u2019s position over\nAverroes\u2019s, but within this mainstream position there was\ndisagreement about the manner in which God relates to the subject of\nmetaphysics, being as being. Albertus Magnus defends Avicenna against\nAverroes\u2019 criticism. Being as being is the subject of\nmetaphysics, whereas the divisions and accidents (passiones)\nof being are what is sought after, among them God and the separate\ndivine beings (Metaph. I.2, Phys. I.3.18). Thomas\nAquinas\u2019 position is again much influenced by Avicenna: The\nsubject of metaphysics is being as being (or ens commune),\nwhereas God is that which is aimed at in this science, insofar as he\nis the cause of all being (In Metaph., prooem.). But, other\nthan Avicenna, Thomas argues that God is the proper subject of a\ndifferent science, the principles of which are given in revelation:\ntheology (Summa theol. Ia q.1).\n\nThere were three principal positions on the issue in the Latin West\n(Zimmermann 1998): Albertus and Thomas make God a subject of\nmetaphysics only as cause of the subject; a second group, among them\nRoger Bacon and Giles of Rome, holds that God is one of several\nsubjects of metaphysics; a third group argues that God is part of the\nsubject of metaphysics. The latter position was influentially\nformulated by Henry of Ghent (Pickav\u00e9 2007), and taken up by\nmany other authors, among them Duns Scotus. Scotus develops his own\nstandpoint against the authorities of Avicenna, Averroes and Henry of\nGhent. He agrees with Avicenna that being as being is the subject and\nthat the notion of being includes all being, be it material or\nimmaterial. For Scotus, this notion of being explicitly includes God\nwithin the subject of metaphysics (Zimmermann 1998,\n294\u2013329).\n",
