The PSR in Eighteenth-Century Philosophy and German Idealism\n\nHume\u2019s critique of causation presents an important challenge to\nthe PSR. In his Treatise of Human Nature (I, 3, 3) Hume\nconsiders several arguments which attempt to prove the \u201cgeneral\nmaxim in philosophy, that whatever begins to exist, must have a\ncause\u201d and finds all of them wanting. Hume argues that\nsince the ideas of cause and its effect are evidently distinct, we can\nclearly conceive or imagine an object without its cause. He takes the\nseparability of the two ideas to show that there is no necessary\nconceptual relation between the ideas of cause and effect insofar as\nconceiving the one without the other does not imply any contradiction\nor absurdity.\n\nChristian Wolff (1679\u20131754), the most influential German\nphilosopher of the first half of the eighteenth century, was a\nfollower of Leibniz and developed the latter\u2019s system. Like\nLeibniz, Wolff assigned to the PSR a central role in his system while\nattempting to avoid necessitarianism (or \u201cfatalism\u201d). Like\nSpinoza and Leibniz, Wolff demanded a reason for both the possibility\nof things [ratio essendi] (i.e., coherence of essence) and\nfor the actualization, or coming to be, of essences [ratio\nfiendi]. Wolff mildly criticized Leibniz for allegedly grounding\nthe PSR merely in experience and attempted to marshal several proofs\nfor the principle (Rational Thoughts on God, the World, and the\nSoul of Human Beings, \u00a7\u00a730\u201331, 143;\nOntologia, \u00a7\u00a756\u201378; cf. Look 2001,\n210\u2013214). One of these proofs attempts to prove the PSR relying\non the principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles (Rational\nThoughts on God, the World, and the Soul of Human Beings\n\u00a731), while the most famous proof attempts to derive the PSR from\nthe Law of Non-Contradiction. According to the latter, if a thing\n\\(A\\) is assumed to exist without reason, than \u201cnothing is\nposited that explains why \\(A\\) exists\u201d. This, according to\nWolff, would mean that \\(A\\) exists because of nothing\n(Ontologia, \u00a770), which Wolff claims to be absurd.\n(Wolff seems to be assuming here the ex nihilo nihi fit\nmaxim.) Kant criticized the proof claiming that it is based on an\nequivocal use of the term \u201cnothing\u201d (AK 1:398).\n\nLeonhard Euler, the great Swiss mathematician and a contemporary of\nWolff, warned against the \u201cwretched abuse\u201d of the PSR by\nthose who\n\n\nemploy it so dexterously that by means of it they are in a condition\nto demonstrate whatever suits their purpose, and to demolish whatever\nis raised against them. (Letters to German Princess, Letter\nXIII)\n\n\nAccording to Euler, many of the proofs which rely on the PSR amount to\nnothing over and above a petitio principii, while others\nderive carelessly the impossibility of things from our ignorance of\nthe causes of these things.\n\nIn the Critique of Pure Reason (1781, 1787), Kant claims to\nprovide a proof for the PSR by showing that\n\n\n[T]he PSR is the ground of possible experience, namely the objective\ncognition of appearances with regards to their relation in the\nsuccessive series of time. (B/246/A201)\n\n\nRelying on his transcendental method Kant argues in the \u201cSecond\nAnalogy of Experience\u201d that a certain version of the PSR is a\ncondition for the possibility of experience, and as a result also a\ncondition for the possibility of objects of experience. Yet, this\nargument also restricts the validity of the PSR to human experience,\ni.e., to things which appear in space and time. Any use of the PSR\nthat transgresses the boundaries of human experience is bound to\ngenerate antinomies.\n\nKant\u2019s view of space and time as exhibiting brute\ndifference (i.e., the non-identity of locations in space and time\ncannot be reduced to conceptual explanation) stands in sharp contrast\nto the Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles, and thereby also\nto the PSR. Salomon Maimon, Kant\u2019s rationalist critic, attempted\nto enforce rationalist strictures on Kant\u2019s philosophy by\narguing that Kant is unable to explain the necessary agreement of\nintuitions and concepts. According to Kant, intuitions and concepts\ncome from entirely different sources: sensibility and understanding.\nBut if this were the case, claims Maimon, we could not explain the\nconstant agreement between intuitions and concepts, which is necessary\nfor the possibility of experience. This agreement can be explained if\nwe reject the radical heterogeneity of intuitions and concepts, and\nview intuitions as disguised concepts. Thus, any difference exhibited\nin space and time must have its ground in the universal forms of our\nthought in general (Maimon, Essay on Transcendental\nPhilosophy, Ch. 1, p. 13). Maimon also argued that we must seek\nan explanation for the fact that we have two forms of\nintuition rather than one, and suggested that it is only the interplay\nbetween the two forms of intuition which allows us to exhibit\ndifference, by using a unity in one form to exhibit difference in the\nother form, i.e., conceive different times by concentrating on the\nchange occurring at the same location in space, or conceive different\nlocations in space at the same point in time (Essay, Ch. 1,\n 13\u201314).\n\nMaimon was probably the strictest adherer to an unrestricted version\nof the PSR among the German Idealists. For Maimon, satisfying the\ndemands of the PSR is the infinite task of both philosophy\nand science. Thus, in response to Maimonides\u2019 claim that crucial\nastronomical facts are poorly explained by science, Maimon writes:\n\n\nThe world may be, in terms of time, finite or infinite; still,\neverything in it (as consequences of the highest wisdom) must be\nexplainable through the principle of sufficient reason. How far\nwe can actually get in achieving this is beside the point. Those\nthings that Maimonides, working with the astronomy of his day,\nregarded as inexplicable, new discoveries (particularly Newton\u2019s\nsystem) equip us to explain quite well. The highest order in the\narrangement of the world\u2019s structure is for us a necessary idea\nof reason, which, through the use of reason with regard to objects of\nexperience, we can approach but never reach. (Maimon, 1792/3\n[2019, 170]; italics added).\n\n\nGround [Grund] and the Principle of Sufficient Ground\n[der Satz vom zureichenden Grund] play a significant role in\nHegel\u2019s Logic. For Hegel, the demand for ground provides a major\nsource of transition from one thing to another. It is, Hegel says,\n\u201cthe expulsion of itself from itself\u201d (Encyclopedia\nLogic, \u00a7121A). Ground, for Hegel, is the unity of identity\nand difference: the ground of \\(x\\) has to explain all features\nof \\(x\\), and in sense duplicates it, yet it must also be\ndifferent from \\(x\\) in order to have explanatory value and not\nbe a mere petitio principii.\n\nThe PSR is the subject of Schopenhauer\u2019s 1813 doctoral\ndissertation: The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient\nReason. In this work, Schopenhauer provides a brief history of\nthe PSR, and then raises the questions of the justification for the\nPSR and the proper scope of the principle. Schopenhauer follows Wolff\nin distinguishing among four kinds of reasons, corresponding to four\nkinds of objects, and charges that much philosophical confusion arises\nfrom attempts to explain objects of one kind by reasoning that belongs\nto the other kind. These four kinds of explanation, or four variants\nof the PSR, share the very same ground. Along Kantian lines\nSchopenhauer suggests that it is the subject\u2019s activity in\nregularly connecting representations that is the ground of the PSR\n(The Fourfold Root, \u00a716).\n",
