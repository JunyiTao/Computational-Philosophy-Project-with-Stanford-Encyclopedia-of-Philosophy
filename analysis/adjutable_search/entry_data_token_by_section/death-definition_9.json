    "main_text": "Further Possibilities || Death as a Cluster Concept not Amenable to Classical Definition\n4.3 Death as Separable from Moral Concerns\n\nA final assumption underlying the mainstream discussion of the\ndefinition of death is that human death is a morally crucial marker.\nWere it not, then accuracy in the definition of death would be of\npurely ontological, conceptual, or scientific interest. This attitude,\nof course, is not the prevailing one. Not only do we tend to regard\nmany behaviors as appropriate only if an individual has died; the\ncriminal law treats as momentous the question of whether one person\nhas killed\u2014that is, caused the death of\u2014another person,\neven if such considerations as motive, deliberation, and special\ncircumstances are also important.\n\nIt is not difficult to see, though, how one might challenge this\npresumption of death's moral salience. After all, we have already\nbegun to remove certain behaviors from the class of death behaviors.\nFor example, in many circumstances termination of life supports need\nnot await a patient's death. And, as we have noted, there are calls to\nabandon the dead-donor rule in the context of organ transplantation.\nWe might go further in separating death from the cluster of moral\nconcerns traditionally associated with it. For example, without\nembracing the higher-brain approach to death, we could hold that\nirreversible loss of the capacity of consciousness entails a loss of\nmoral status, at which point traditional death behaviors are\nappropriate (Persson 2002). We might even overhaul the criminal law\nwith respect to killing:\n\nIt is then the irrevocable loss of the capacity for consciousness that\nis the great loss; so it is for the causing of it that criminal law\nshould mete out the severest punishment. Killing, or the causing of\n(biological) death, should be punished to this degree only if, as is\nnormally the case, it brings along the irrevocable loss of the\ncapacity for consciousness (ibid, 32).\n\n\nOne implication of this proposal is that harvesting organs from PVS\npatients, thereby killing them, would not be punishable insofar as\nthese patients, having irrevocably lost the capacity for\nconsciousness, have already suffered \u201cthe great loss\u201d and\nno longer possess moral status. Some attracted to this approach will\nwant to argue further that the crime of murder is really that of\ncausing the irrevocable loss of the capacity for consciousness\nwithout first obtaining voluntary, informed consent from the\nperson to be killed. The\nitalicized qualification would create conceptual space for a\njustification of active euthanasia (see the entry on\n voluntary euthanasia).\n\nThe present proposal to separate the issue of death from what is\nmorally important is somewhat radical. Yet its chief ground for doing\nso, the claim that the capacity for consciousness is what underlies\nmoral status, cannot be dismissed. On the other hand, this claim\napparently relies on the thesis (which we considered in connection\nwith the higher-brain approach) that only what affects one's\nexperience can affect one's interests. As we saw, this thesis is far\nfrom self-evident. For those who disagree with it, the time of\ndeath\u2014the time at which one no longer exists (at least in this\nworld)\u2014is likely to retain some of the moral importance\ntraditionally accorded to it. Moreover, even if the philosophical case\nfor demoting the moral importance of death were airtight, we cannot\nresponsibly dismiss widely held sensibilities, including those at odds\nwith the present approach, in constructing public policies concerning\ndeath. Certainly it is contestable to what extent the public could\nembrace further demotion of the moral importance of death, and to what\nextent its limited ability to do so matters for public policy.\n",
