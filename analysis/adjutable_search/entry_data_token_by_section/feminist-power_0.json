    "main_text": "Defining power\n1. Defining power\n\nIn social and political theory, power is often regarded as an\nessentially contested concept (see Lukes 1974 and 2005, and Connolly\n1983). Although this claim is itself contested (see Haugaard 2010 and\n2020, 4\u201310; Morriss 2002, 199\u2013206 and Wartenberg 1990,\n12\u201317), there is no doubt that the literature on power is marked\nby deep, widespread, and seemingly intractable disagreements over how\nthe term should be understood.\n\nOne such disagreement pits those who define power as getting someone\nelse to do what you want them to do, that is, as an exercise of\npower-over others, against those who define it as an ability or a\ncapacity to act, that is, as a power-to do something. The classic\nformulation of the former definition is offered by Max Weber, who\ndefines power as \u201cthe probability that one actor within a social\nrelationship will be in a position to carry out his own will despite\nresistance\u2026\u201d (1978, 53). Similarly, Robert Dahl offers\nwhat he calls an \u201cintuitive idea of power\u201d according to\nwhich \u201cA has power over B to the extent that he can get B to do\nsomething that B would not otherwise do\u201d (1957, 202\u201303).\nDahl\u2019s discussion of power sparked a vigorous debate that\ncontinued until the mid-1970s, but even his sharpest critics seemed to\nconcede his definition of power as an exercise of power-over others\n(see Bachrach and Baratz 1962 and Lukes 1974). As Steven Lukes notes,\nDahl\u2019s one-dimensional view of power, Bachrach and\nBaratz\u2019s two-dimensional view, and his own three-dimensional\nview are all variations of \u201cthe same underlying conception of\npower, according to which A exercises power over B when A affects B in\na manner contrary to B\u2019s interests\u201d (1974, 30). Similarly,\nbut from a very different theoretical background, Michel\nFoucault\u2019s highly influential analysis implicitly presupposes\nthat power is a kind of power-over; and he puts it, \u201cif we speak\nof the structures or the mechanisms of power, it is only insofar as we\nsuppose that certain persons exercise power over others\u201d (1983,\n217). Notice that there are two salient features of this definition of\npower: power is understood in terms of power-over relations, and it is\ndefined in terms of its actual exercise.\n\nClassic articulations of power understood as power-to have been\noffered by Thomas Hobbes \u2013 power is a person\u2019s\n\u201cpresent means\u2026to obtain some future apparent Good\u201d\n(Hobbes 1985 (1641), 150) \u2013 and Hannah Arendt \u2013 power is\n\u201cthe human ability not just to act but to act in concert\u201d\n(1970, 44). Arguing in favor of this way of conceptualizing power,\nHanna Pitkin notes that the word \u201cpower\u201d is related\netymologically to the French pouvoir and the Latin\npotere, both of which mean to be able. \u201cThat\nsuggests,\u201d she writes, \u201cthat power is a something \u2013\nanything \u2013 which makes or renders somebody able to do, capable\nof doing something. Power is capacity, potential, ability, or\nwherewithal\u201d (1972, 276). Similarly, Peter Morriss (2002) and\nLukes (2005) define power as a dispositional concept, meaning, as\nLukes puts it, that power \u201cis a potentiality, not an actuality\n\u2013 indeed a potentiality that may never be actualized\u201d\n(2005, 69). (Note that this statement amounts to a significant\nrevision of Lukes\u2019s earlier analysis of power, in which he\nargued against defining power as power-to on the grounds that such a\ndefinition obscures \u201cthe conflictual aspect of power \u2013 the\nfact that it is exercised over people\u201d and thus fails to address\nwhat we care about most when we decide to study power (1974, 31). For\nhelpful discussion of whether Lukes\u2019s embrace of the\ndispositional conception of power is compatible with his other\ntheoretical commitments, see Haugaard (2010)). Some of the theorists\nwho analyze power as power-to leave power-over entirely out of their\nanalysis. For example, Arendt distinguishes power sharply from\nauthority, strength, force, and violence, and offers a normative\naccount in which power is understood as an end in itself (1970). As\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas has argued, this has the effect of screening any\nand all strategic understandings of power (where power is understood\nin the Weberian sense as imposing one\u2019s will on another) out of\nher analysis (Habermas 1994). (Although Arendt defines power as a\ncapacity, she also maintains that \u201cpower springs up between men\nwhen they act together and vanishes the moment they disperse\u201d\n(1958, 200); hence, it is not clear whether she fully accepts a\ndispositional view of power). Others suggest that both aspects of\npower are important, but then focus their attention on either\npower-over (e.g., Connolly 1993) or power-to (e.g., Morriss 2002).\nStill others define power-over as a particular type of capacity,\nnamely, the capacity to impose one\u2019s will on others; on this\nview, power-over is a derivative form of power-to (Allen 1999, Lukes\n2005). However, others have argued power-over and power-to refer to\nfundamentally different concepts and that it is a mistake to try to\ndevelop an account of power that integrates them (Pitkin 1972,\nWartenberg 1990).\n\nAnother way of carving up the power literature is to distinguish\nbetween action-theoretical conceptions \u2013 that is, those that\ndefine power in terms of either the actions or the dispositional\nabilities of individual actors \u2013 and broader systemic or\nconstitutive conceptions \u2013 that is, those that view power as\nsystematically structuring possibilities for action, or, more\nstrongly, as constitutive of social actors and the social world in\nwhich they act. On this way of distinguishing various conceptions of\npower, Hobbes and Weber are on the same side, since both of them\nunderstand power in primarily instrumentalist, individualist, and\naction-theoretical terms (Saar 2010, 10). The systemic conception, by\ncontrast, views power as \u201cthe ways in which given social systems\nconfer differentials of dispositional power on agents, thus\nstructuring their possibilities for action\u201d (Haugaard 2010, 425;\nsee Clegg 1989). The systemic conception thus highlights the ways in\nwhich broad historical, political, economic, cultural, and social\nforces enable some individuals to exercise power over others, or\ninculcate certain abilities and dispositions in some actors but not in\nothers. Saar argues, however, that the systemic conception of power\nshould be understood not as an alternative to the action-theoretical\nconception of power, but rather as a more complex and sophisticated\nvariant of that model. For, as he says, its \u201cbasic scenario\nremains individualistic at the methodological level: power operates on\nindividuals as individuals, in the form of a \u2018bringing to\naction\u2019 or external determination\u201d (Saar 2010, 14).\n\nThe constitutive conception of power pushes the insight of the\nsystemic conception further by focusing on the constitutive\nrelationships between power, individuals, and the social worlds they\ninhabit. The roots of this constitutive conception can be traced back\nto Spinoza (2002a and 2002b; Saar 2013), but variants of this view are\nalso found in the work of more contemporary theorists such as Arendt\nand Foucault. Here it is important to note that Foucault\u2019s work\non power contains both action-theoretical and constitutive strands.\nThe former strand is evident in his claim, cited above, that \u201cif\nwe speak of the structures or the mechanisms of power, it is only\ninsofar as we suppose that certain persons exercise power over\nothers\u201d (Foucault 1983, 217), whereas the latter strand is\nevident in his definition of power as \u201cthe multiplicity of force\nrelations immanent in the sphere in which they operate and which\nconstitute their own organization; as the processes which, through\nceaseless struggles and confrontations, transforms, strengthens, or\nreverses them;\u2026thus forming a chain or system\u201d (Foucault\n1979, 92).\n\nWhat accounts for the highly contested nature of the concept of power?\nOne explanation is that how we conceptualize power is shaped by the\npolitical and theoretical interests that we bring to our study of it\n(Lukes 1986, Said 1986). For example, democratic theorists are\ninterested in different things when they study power than are social\nmovement theorists or critical race theorists or postcolonial\ntheorists, and so on. Thus, a specific conceptualization of power\ncould be more or less useful depending on the specific disciplinary or\ntheoretical context in which it is deployed, where usefulness is\nevaluated in terms of how well it \u201caccomplishes the task the\ntheorists set for themselves\u201d (Haugaard 2010, 426). On this\nview, if we suppose that feminists who are interested in power are\ninterested in understanding and critiquing gender-based relations of\ndomination and subordination as these intersect with other axes of\noppression and thinking about how such relations can be transformed\nthrough individual and collective resistance, then we would conclude\nthat specific conceptions of power should be evaluated in terms of how\nwell they enable feminists to fulfill those aims.\n\nLukes suggests another, more radical, explanation for the essentially\ncontested nature of the concept of power: our conceptions of power\nare, according to him, themselves shaped by power relations. As he\nputs it, \u201chow we think about power may serve to reproduce and\nreinforce power structures and relations, or alternatively it may\nchallenge and subvert them. It may contribute to their continued\nfunctioning, or it may unmask their principles of operation, whose\neffectiveness is increased by their being hidden from view. To the\nextent that this is so, conceptual and methodological questions are\ninescapably political and so what \u2018power\u2019 means is\n\u2018essentially contested\u2019\u2026\u201d (Lukes 2005, 63).\nThe thought that conceptions of power are themselves shaped by power\nrelations is behind the claim, made by many feminists, that the\ninfluential conception of power as power-over is itself a product of\npatriarchal domination (for further discussion, see section 4\nbelow).\n",
