    "main_text": "Varieties of Physicalism\n3. Varieties of Physicalism\n\nWe have been considering various answers to the completeness question,\nnamely, what it means to say that everything is physical. At this\npoint, it is worth considering two issues associated with completeness\nthat have not so far been brought to the surface, and which suggest\ndifferent varieties of physicalism. The first is whether physicalism\ninvolves a kind of reductionism; the second is whether physicalism\ninvolves what philosophers call a priori entailment or deducibility.\n\n3.1 Reductive and Non-reductive Physicalism\n\nThe main problem in assessing whether a physicalist must be a\nreductionist is that there are various non-equivalent versions of\nreductionism.\n\nOne idea is tied to the notion of conceptual or reductive analysis.\nWhen philosophers attempt to provide an analysis of some concept or\nnotion, they often try to provide a reductive analysis of the notion\nin question, i.e. to analyze it in other terms. Applied to the\nphilosophy of mind, this notion might be thought of entailing the idea\nthat every mental concept or predicate is analyzed in terms of a\nphysical concept or predicate. A formulation of this idea is (9):\n\n(9)\n Reductionism is true iff for each mental predicate F,\nthere is a physical predicate G such that a sentence of the\nform \u2018 x is F iff x is\nG\u2019 is analytically true.\n\n\nWhile one occasionally finds in the literature the suggestion that\nphysicalists are committed to (9) in fact, no physicalist since before\nSmart (1959) has (unqualifiedly) held anything like it. Adapting Ryle\n(1949), Smart supposed that in addition to physical expressions there\nis a class of expressions which are topic-neutral, i.e. expressions\nwhich were neither mental nor physical but when conjoined with any\ntheory would greatly increase the expressive power of the theory.\nSmart suggested that one might analyze mental expressions in\ntopic-neutral (but not physical) terms, which in effect means that a\nphysicalist could reject (9).\n\nA different notion of reduction derives from the attempts of\nphilosophers of science to explain intertheoretic reduction. The\nclassic formulation of this notion was given by Ernest Nagel (1961).\nNagel said that one theory was reduced to another if you could\nlogically derive the first from the second together with what he\ncalled bridge laws, i.e., laws connecting the predicates of the\nreduced theory (the theory to be reduced) with the predicates of the\nreducing theory (the theory to which one is reducing). Here is a\nformulation of this idea, where the theories in question are\npsychology and neuroscience:\n\n(10)\n Reductionism is true iff for each mental predicate F\nthere is a neurobiological predicate G such that a sentence\nof the form \u2018x is F iff x is\nG\u2019 expresses a bridge law.\n\n\nOnce again, however, there is no reason at all why physicalists need\nto accept that reductionism is true in the sense of (10). We noted\nearlier that the possibility of multiple realization renders type\nphysicalism implausible; something similar is true in this case. Many\ndifferent neurobiological processes (whether in our own species or a\ndifferent one) could underlie the same psychological process \u2014\nindeed, given science fiction, even non-neurobiological processes\nmight underlie the same psychological process. If so, (10) seems to be\nfalse. (For a classic presentation of multiple realization and\nreductionism, see Fodor 1974, but for an alternative view, see Kim\n1993).\n\nA third notion of reductionism is more metaphysical in focus than\neither the conceptual or theoretical ideas reviewed so far. According\nto this notion, reductionism means that the properties expressed by\nthe predicates of (say) a psychological theory are identical to the\nproperties expressed by the predicates of (say) a neurobiological\ntheory \u2014 in other words, this version of reductionism is in\nessence a version of type physicalism or the identity theory. As we\nhave already seen, however, since a physicalism need not be a type\nphysicalism, it need not be reductionism in this metaphysical sense\neither\n\nA final notion of reductionism that needs to be distinguished from the\nprevious three concerns whether mental statements follow a\npriori from non-mental statements. Here is a statement of this\nsort of idea,\n\n(11)\n Reductionism is true iff for each mental predicate F\nthere is non-mental predicate G such that a sentence of the\nform \u201cif x is F then x is\nG\u201d is a priori.\n\n\nWhat (11) says is that if reductionism is true, a priori\nknowledge alone, plus knowledge of the physical or non-mental truths\nwill allow one to know the mental truths. This question is usually\ndebated in the context of another, viz., the question of a\nposteriori and a priori physicalism. So we now turn to\nthat question.\n3.2 A Priori and A Posteriori Physicalism\n\nWe have been assuming that supervenience is necessary for physicalism,\neven if it is not sufficient. But what follows from supervenience? One\nthing that is usually thought to follow is that the physical truths of\nthe world entail all the truths; hence physicalism is true at\nall (12) is true\n\n(12)\n The physical truths entail all the truths.\n\n\nNow suppose that S is a statement which specifies the\nphysical nature of the actual world and S* is a statement\nwhich specifies the total nature of the world. (It might be that\nneither S nor S* are expressible in languages we can\nunderstand, but let us set this aside.) Then physicalism tells us in\naddition that that: \n\n(13)\n S entails S*\n\n\nAnother way to say this is to say that if supervenience physicalism is\ntrue, the following conditional is necessarily true: \n\n(14)\n If S then S*\n\n\nIndeed, this is a general feature of supervenience physicalism: if it\nis true then there will always be a necessary truth of the form of\n(14). \n\nNow, if (14) is necessary the question arises whether it is a\npriori, i.e. knowable independent of empirical experience, or\nwhether it is a posteriori, i.e. knowable but not\nindependently of empirical experience. Traditionally, every statement\nthat was necessary was assumed to be a priori. However, since\nKripke\u2019s Naming and Necessity (1980), philosophers have\nbecome used to the idea that there are truths which are both necessary\nand a posteriori. Accordingly many recent philosophers have\ndefended a posteriori physicalism: the claim that statements\nsuch as (14) are necessary and a posteriori (cf. Loar 1997).\nMoreover, they have used this point to try to disarm many objections\nto physicalism, including those concerning qualia and intentionality\nthat we will consider below. Moreover, as we have just noted, some\nphilosophers have suggested that the necessary a posteriori\nprovides the proper interpretation of non-reductive physicalism.\n\nThe appeal to the necessary a posteriori is on the surface an\nattractive one, but it is also controversial. One problem arises from\nthe fact that Kripke\u2019s idea that there are necessary and a\nposteriori truths can be interpreted in two rather different\nways. On the first interpretation \u2014 I will call it the\nderivation view \u2014 while there are necessary a\nposteriori truths, these truths can be derived a priori\nfrom truths which are a posteriori and contingent. On the\nsecond interpretation \u2014 I will call it the non-derivation view\n\u2014 there are non-derived necessary a posteriori\ntruths, i.e. necessary truths which are not derived from any\ncontingent truths (or any a priori truths for that matter).\nThe problem is that when one combines the derivation view with the\nclaim that (14) is necessary and a posteriori, one encounters\na contradiction. If the derivation view is correct, then there is some\ncontingent and a posteriori statement S# that\nlogically entails (14). However, if S# logically entails (14)\nthen (since \u2018If C, then if A then\nB\u2019 is equivalent to \u2018If C &\nA, then B\u2019) we can infer that the following is\nboth necessary and a priori:\n\n(15)\n If S & S# then S*.\n\n\nOne the other hand, if physicalism is true, and S summarizes\nthe total nature of the world then\nS# is already implicitly included in S. In other\nwords, (15) is simply an expansion\nof (14). But if (15) is just an expansion of (14), then if (15) is\na priori, (14) must also be a priori. But that means\nour initial assumption is false: (14) is not a necessary a\nposteriori truth after all (see Jackson 1998). \n\nHow might an a posteriori physicalist respond to this\nobjection? The obvious response is to reject the derivation view of\nthe necessary a posteriori in favor of the non-derivation\nview. But this is just to say that if one wants to defend a\nposteriori physicalism, one will have to defend the\nnon-derivation view of the necessary a posteriori. However,\nthe non-derivation view is controversial, so it is not something that\nwe can hope to solve here. (For discussion, see Byrne 1999, Chalmers\n1996, 1999, Jackson 1998, Loar 1997, Lewis 1994, Yablo 1999, and the\npapers in Gendler and Hawthorne 2004)\n4. The Condition Question\n\nEarlier we distinguished two interpretative questions with respect to\nphysicalism, the completeness question and the condition question. So\nfar we have been concerned with the completeness question. I turn now\nto the condition question, the question of what it is for something\n(an object, an event, a process, a property) to be physical.\n\nThis issue has received less attention in the literature than the\nquestions we have been studying so far. But it is just as important.\nWithout any understanding of what the physical is, we can have no\nserious understanding of what physicalism is. After all, what does it\nmean to say that everything is physical, as opposed to chemical or\nfinancial. (The point here is quite general: if Thales says that\neverything is water, we don\u2019t understand what he says unless he\nsays something about what water is. The physicalist is in the same\nboat.)\n4.1 The Theory and Object Conceptions of the Physical\n\nSo what is the answer to the condition question? If we concentrate for\nsimplicity on the notion of a physical property, we can discern two\nkinds of answers to this question (see Stoljar 2001, Stoljar 2010,\nTiehen 2018). The first ties the notion of a physical property to a\nnotion of a physical theory, for this reason we can call it the\ntheory-based conception of a physical property:\n\nThe theory-based conception:\n\nA property is physical iff it is the sort of property that physical\ntheory tells us about.\n\nAccording to the theory-based conception, for example, if physical\ntheory tells us about the property of having mass, then having mass is\na physical property. (The theory-based conception bears some relation\nto the notion of physical1 discussed in Feigl 1967; more explicit\ndefense is found in Smart 1978, Lewis 1994, Braddon-Mitchell and\nJackson 1996, and Chalmers 1996.)\n\nThe second kind of answer ties the notion of a physical property to\nthe notion of a physical object, for this reason we can call it the\nobject-based conception of a physical property:\n\nThe object-based conception:\n\nA property is physical iff it is the sort of property had by\nparadigmatic physical objects and their constituents.\n\nAccording to the object-based conception, for example if paradigmatic\nphysical objects such as rocks or planets are solid or are located in\nspace or have mass, then the property of being solid or located in\nspace or having mass is a physical property. (The best examples of\nphilosophers who operate with the object-conception of the physical\nare Meehl and Sellars 1956 and Feigl 1967; more recent defense is to\nbe found in Jackson 1998.)\n\nDo these conceptions characterize the same class of properties? There\nare a number of different possibilities here, but one that has\nreceived some attention in the literature is that physical theory only\ntells us about the dispositional properties of physical objects, and\nso does not tell us about the categorical properties, if any, that\nthey have \u2014 a thesis of this sort has been defended by a number\nof philosophers, among them Russell (1927), Armstrong (1968),\nBlackburn (1992) and Chalmers (1996). Hence, if physical objects do\nhave categorical properties, those properties will not count as\nphysical by the standards of the theory conception. On the other hand,\nthere seems no reason not to count them as physical in some sense or\nother. If that is right, however, then the possibility emerges that\nthe theory- and the object-conceptions characterize distinct classes\nof properties. \n\nA further distinction that can be made here, and which cross-cuts the\ntheory/object distinction, is between a more narrow and a more broad\nconception of a physical property (see Chalmers 2015). A narrow\nconception counts as a physical property only those within a\nrestricted range. On the theory conception, for example, these might\nthe properties expressed by fundamental physics. A broader conception\ncounts as physical property any property which is either a property in\nthe narrow sense (a narrow physical property, as we might call it) or\nelse bears the right kind of relation to narrow physical properties,\nfor example, is definable in terms of them, or is grounded in them.\nThere are lots of complications here, partly because there are\ndifferent ways of restricting the narrow class, and different ways of\nextending such a class. Here we will understand the theory and object\nconceptions in a narrower rather than a broad way.\n4.2 Circularity\n\nAlong with the concepts of space, time, causality, value, meaning,\ntruth and existence, the concept of the physical is one of the central\nconcepts of human thought. So it should not be surprising that any\nattempt to come to grips with what a physical property is will be\ncontroversial. The theory and object conceptions are no different:\neach has provoked a number of different questions and criticisms. In\nthe remainder of our discussion of the condition question, I will\nreview some main ones.\n\nTo begin with, one might object that both conceptions are inadequate\nbecause they are circular, i.e., both appeal to the notion of\nsomething physical (a theory or an object) to characterize a physical\nproperty. But how can you legitimately explain the notion of one sort\nof physical thing by appealing to another? \n\nHowever, the response to this is that circularity is only a problem if\nthe conceptions are interpreted as providing a reductive analysis of\nthe notion of the physical. But there is no reason why they should be\ninterpreted in that way. After all, we have many concepts that we\nunderstand without knowing how to analyze (cf. Lewis 1970). So there\nseems no reason to suppose that either the theory or object conception\nis providing anything else but a way of understanding the notion of\nthe physical.\n\nThe point here is an important one in the context of the condition\nquestion. Earlier we said that the condition question was perfectly\nlegitimate because it is legitimate to ask what the condition of being\nphysical is that, according to physicalism, everything has. But this\nlegitimate question should not be interpreted as the demand for a\nreductive analysis of the notion of the physical. Consider Thales\nagain: it is right to ask Thales what he means by \u2018water\u2019\n\u2014 and in so doing demand an understanding of the notion of water\n\u2014 but it is wrong to demand of him a conceptual analysis of\nwater.\n4.3 Hempel\u2019s dilemma\n\nOne might object that any formulation of physicalism which utilizes\nthe theory-based conception will be either trivial or false. Carl\nHempel (cf. Hempel 1969, see also Crane and Mellor 1990) provided a\nclassic formulation of this problem: if physicalism is defined via\nreference to contemporary physics, then it is false \u2014 after all,\nwho thinks that contemporary physics is complete? \u2014 but if\nphysicalism is defined via reference to a future or ideal physics,\nthen it is trivial \u2014 after all, who can predict what a future\nphysics contains? Perhaps, for example, it contains even mental items.\nThe conclusion of the dilemma is that one has no clear concept of a\nphysical property, or at least no concept that is clear enough to do\nthe job that philosophers of mind want the physical to play. \n\nOne response to this objection is to take its first horn, and insist\nthat, at least in certain respects contemporary physics really is\ncomplete or else that it is rational to believe that it is (cf. Smart\n1978, Lewis 1994 and Melnyk 1997, 2003). There is an element of truth\nin this. It may be rational to believe that contemporary science is\ntrue, even if not that it is complete. Nevertheless, it also seems\nmistaken to define physicalism with respect to the physics\nthat happens to be true in this world. The reason is that whether a\nphysical theory is true or not is a function of the contingent facts;\nbut whether a property is physical or not is not a function of the\ncontingent facts. For example, consider medieval impetus physics.\nMedieval impetus physics is false (though of course it might not have\nbeen) and thus it is irrational to suppose it true. Nevertheless, the\nproperty of having impetus \u2014 the central property that objects\nhave according to impetus physics \u2014 is a physical property, and\na counterfactual world completely described by impetus physics would\nbe a world in which physicalism is true. But it is hard to see how any\nof this could be right if physicalism were defined by reference to the\nphysics that we have now or by the physics that happens to be true in\nour world. (For development of this point, and for a dilemma that is\nsimilar to Hempel\u2019s but which casts the issue in modal rather\nthan temporal terms, see Stoljar 2010; for discussion, see Baltimore\n2013, Fiorese 2016)\n\nA different response to Hempel\u2019s dilemma is that what it shows,\nif it shows anything, is that a particular proposal about how to\ndefine a physical property \u2014 namely, via reference to physics at\na particular stage of its development \u2014 is mistaken. But from\nthis one can hardly conclude that we have no clear understanding of\nthe concept at all. As we have seen, we have many concepts that we\ndon\u2019t know how to analyze. So the mere fact \u2014 if indeed it\nis a fact \u2014 that a certain style of analysis of the notion of\nthe physical fails does not mean that there is no notion of the\nphysical at all, still less that we don\u2019t understand the\nnotion.\n\nOne might object that, while these remarks are perfectly true, they\nnevertheless don\u2019t speak to something that is right about\nHempel\u2019s dilemma, namely, that for the theory-conception to be\ncomplete one needs to know what type of theory a physical theory is.\nPerhaps one might appeal here to the fact that we have a number of\nparadigms of what a physical theory is: common sense physical theory,\nmedieval impetus physics, Cartesian contact mechanics, Newtonian\nphysics, and modern quantum physics. While it seems unlikely that\nthere is any one factor that unifies this class of theories,\nperhaps there is a cluster of factors \u2014 a common or overlapping\nset of theoretical constructs, for example, or a shared methodology.\nIf so, one might maintain that the notion of a physical theory is a\nWittgensteinian family resemblance concept. However, whether this is\nenough to answer the question of what kind of theory a physical theory\nis remains to be seen. (For further discussion of Hempel\u2019s\ndilemma, see the papers in Elpidorou 2018a.) \n4.4 The panpsychism problem\n\nHempel\u2019s dilemma against the theory-conception is similar to an\nobjection that one often hears propounded against the\nobject-conception (cf. Jackson 1998). Consider a version of\npanpsychism according to which all the physical objects of our\nacquaintance are conscious beings just as we are. (For further\ndiscussion and different versions of this view, see\n Panpsychism.)\n Would physicalism be true in that situation? It seems intuitively\nnot; however, if physicalism is defined via reference to the\nobject-conception of a physical property then it is hard to see why\nnot. After all, according to that conception, something is a physical\nproperty just in case it is required by a complete account of\nparadigmatic physical objects. But this makes no reference to the\nnature of paradigmatic physical objects, and so allows the\npossibility that physicalism is true in the imagined situation.\n\nOne thing to say in response to this objection is that the mere\npossibility of panpsychism cannot really be what is at issue here. For\npanpsychism per se is not inconsistent with physicalism (cf. Lewis\n1983). After all, the fact that there are some conscious\nbeings is not contrary to physicalism \u2014 why then should the\npossibility that everything is a conscious being be contrary\nto physicalism? If so, what is at issue in the objection is not\npanpsychism so much as the possibility that the paradigms or exemplars\nin terms of which one characterizes the notion of the physical might\nturn out to be radically different from what we normally assume in a\nquite specific sense \u2014 they might turn out to be in some\nessential or ultimate respect mental.\n\nOnce the problem is put like that, however, the panpsychism problem\nlooks similar to a problem that arises in general whenever one one\ntries to understand or define a concept in terms of paradigmatic\nobjects which fall under it, viz., that these definitions have certain\nsort of empirical presuppositions that might turn out to be false.\nSuppose one tried to define the concept red in terms of similarity to\nparadigmatic red things, such as blood. Pursuing this strategy commits\none to the idea that the belief that blood is red is a piece of common\nknowledge shared among all those who are competent with the term. But\nthat seems wrong \u2014 someone who thought that blood was green\nwould be mistaken about blood but not about red. Now this problem is a\ndifficult problem, however \u2014 and this is the crucial point for\nour purposes \u2014 the problem is also a quite general problem; it\narises because of the paradigm style of definition. So to that extent,\nthe concept of the physical does not seem to be any worse off than the\nconcept of red, the panpsychism problem notwithstanding. (For\ndiscussion of the general strategy see Lewis 1997)\n\nOf course, one would reject this entire line of thought if one\nrejected its starting point, viz., that panpsychism is consistent with\nphysicalism. Wilson (2006, 78\u20139), for example, suggests that\nwhile physicalism is consistent with the view that some conscious\nbeings exist, it is not consistent with the view that some fundamental\nconscious beings exist, and it is this last claim that is definitive\nof panpsychism. But in fact even that is consistent with physicalism,\nthough admittedly of an unusual sort. To illustrate, imagine a world\nin which the fundamental properties are both mental and physical. That\nis certainly a far-fetched scenario but it doesn\u2019t seem to be\nimpossible. Would physicalism be true in such a world? It is hard to\nsee why not; at least it may be true at that world that any physical\nduplicate of it is a duplicate simpliciter. Would panpsychism\nlikewise be true at such a world? Again, it is hard to see why not,\nsince the fundamental properties instantiated at such a world are\nmental, though of course they are also physical.\n4.5 The via negativa \n\nOne idea that often emerges in the context of Hempel\u2019s dilemma\nand the panpsychism problem, but deserves separate treatment, is the\nso-called Via Negativa (see e.g. Montero and Papineau 2005, Wilson\n2006, Fiorese 2016). \n\nThe simplest way to introduce the Via Negativa is to interpret it as a\ndefinition of the notion a physical property something like this:\nF is a physical property if and only if F is a\nnon-mental property. But there are many reasons to resist such a\ndefinition. Take vitalism. Vitalism isn\u2019t true, but it might\nhave been true; there is no contradiction in it for example. So\nimagine a world in which plants and animals instantiate the key\nproperty associated with vitalism, viz., \u00e9lan vital. It seems\nreasonable to say that in that case plants and animals instantiate a\nproperty that is non-physical, i.e. \u00e9lan vital is not physical.\nAnd yet one should not say on this account that plants and animals\ninstantiate a mental property, i.e., \u00e9lan vital is not mental.\nIn short, \u00e9lan vital is neither mental nor physical. But the\nVia Negativa as stated cannot accommodate that fact.\n\nOne might try to meet this objection by revising the Via Negativa so\nthat what is intended is only a partial definition along these lines:\nF is a physical property only if F is non-mental. Even\nso problems remain. As we have seen \u00e9lan vital causes a problem\nbecause it is neither mental nor physical. But there might be\nproperties that are both mental and physical. Consider a version of\nthe identity theory according to which being in pain just is c-fibers\nfiring. If we suppose that such a theory is true, is the property of\nbeing in pain then mental or physical? Both presumably; but this could\nnot be true on the Via Negativa construed as a definition of what a\nphysical property is, even a partial definition. For if a property is\nmental and physical, then, given the Via Negativa, it will be both\nmental and non-mental which (of course) it can\u2019t be! Now\nobviously, there are good questions about whether an identity theory\nalong these lines is or could be true, but regardless of whether it is\ntrue, it should not be ruled out simply because of a proposal about\nhow to define the words in which it is stated. \n\nAlternatively, one might try to meet the objection by adopting what\nWilson 2006 calls the \u2018no fundamental mentality\u2019\nconstraint. On this interpretation, what proponents of the Via\nNegativa have in mind is that F is a physical property only if\nF is not fundamentally mental, where in turn to be \u2018not\nfundamentally mental\u2019 is most naturally understood as entailing\nthat if F is a fundamental property then it is non-mental. This\nversion of the view avoids the problem about having c-fibers since\npresumably that property is not fundamental. But once again problems\nremain. Take the world we considered above at which the fundamental\nproperties are both mental and physical; in effect, what applies to\nc-fibers firing (if the identity theory is true) applies to the\nfundamental properties instantiated at this world. As I said, this\nscenario is far-fetched, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be impossible,\nand it is certainly not impossible simply as a matter of the\ndefinition of the words. And yet it would be impossible for that\nreason if the \u2018no fundamental mentality\u2019 version of the\nVia Negativa were true.\n\nOf course, to raise these problems for the Via Negativa is not to deny\nthat there is something right about it. For example, when we think of\nproperties that would falsify physicalism we do often think of\n*certain* mental properties, e.g., the distinctive properties of\nectoplasm or ESP. However, this fact\u2014that certain mental\nproperties would, if instantiated, falsify physicalism\u2014can be\ncaptured without defining the physical in general as the non-mental. A\nbetter way would be to require, of any spelling out of the notion of\nthe physical, whether it be the object-based account or the\ntheory-based account, that it respect that fact that some\n(uninstantiated) mental properties are non-physical.\n4.6 Structuralist Approaches\n\nAnother idea about how to define the physical that has become\nprominent in recent times is a structuralist approach to the\nphysical.\n\nOne way to introduce the structuralist approach is to see it as a\ndevelopment of the theory conception formulated above. On the theory\nview, a property is physical just in case it is tied in the right way\nto a physical theory. One problem that arises for such a view, as we\nhave seen, is what \u2018physical theory\u2019 is supposed to mean\nhere. For the structuralist (at least in the context;\n\u2018structuralism\u2019 can mean many different things), a\nphysical theory is one that employs a restricted vocabulary. One\nparticularly frank version of this sort of view is suggested by\nRussell 1927; on this view, the vocabulary in question is restricted\nto logical or mathematical vocabulary. Contemporary philosophers adopt\na less restricted view according to which the vocabulary is either\nlogical or mathematical or causal or nomological (i.e. pertaining to\nlaws) or some combination of these (see Alter 2016, Chalmers 2020,\nGoff 2017; for criticism see Stoljar 2020). In effect, proposals like\nthis provide a topic-neutral conception of the physical, and hence a\ntopic-neutral conception of physicalism.\n\nAn attractive feature of this approach is that it provides an answer\nto Hempel\u2019s dilemma and similar problems. Physics may indeed\nchange over time, but according to the structuralist, any physical\ntheory must be restricted to this sort of vocabulary. Hence we can\nappeal to the notion of a physical theory to formulate a version of\nphysicalism on which everything supervenes on or is realised by or is\ngrounded in physical properties that can be expressed in that limited\nvocabulary. (Here structuralism about the physical draws support from\nstructural realism in philosophy of science, a position to which it is\nin some ways quite similar; see, e.g.\n Structural Realism)\n\nHowever, a problem for structuralism (developed in Stoljar 2020) is\nthat, while placing restrictions of this sort on the notion of a\nphysical theory helps with Hempel\u2019s dilemma, it also seems\noverly stringent. Physical theories on the face of it tell you lots of\nthings about the physical world which are not topic-neutral, for\nexample, about mass, energy, electrons, protons and a myriad other\nthings. The idea that we can capture all of this using a language that\nemploys only logical/mathematical or causal/nomic vocabulary\nmay seem an overly ambitious one. \n\nWhile there are problems with structuralist approaches to the\nphysical, as with the Via Negativa, there is also something right\nabout it. We have noted one idea in philosophy of science that is\nsimilar to the structuralist approach to the physical, namely,\nstructural realism. A different idea that philosophers of science have\nemphasised a lot in recent literature is that physicists and other\nscientists often construct mathematical models of the systems they are\ninterested in; moreover, they often focus on the mathematical\nproperties of these models themselves (see, e.g. Weisberg 2013).\nPerhaps a structuralist approach to such mathematical models is\nplausible. Nevertheless, structuralism about the physical is a thesis,\nnot about these mathematical models, but about the target systems that\nthese models correspond to, and it precisely this that causes the\nproblem.\n4.7 Physicalism as an Attitude\n\nIn view of the difficulties posed by Hempel\u2019s dilemma and\nrelated problems, some philosophers have explored the interesting idea\nthat to be a physicalist is not to hold some thesis or belief \u2013\nthat is, to hold something that may be true or false \u2013 but is\nrather to adopt a kind of attitude or stance. As Alyssa Ney (2008, p.\n9, see also Van Fraassen 2002) develops this \u201cattitudinal\u201d\nview, for example, \u201cphysicalism is an attitude one takes to form\none\u2019s ontology completely and solely according to what physics\nsays exists\u201d. \n\nNow, as with other ideas we have looked at, there is certainly\nsomething right about the attitudinal view. As we will see below,\ncontemporary physicalists are often methodological naturalists, and\nmethodological naturalists may well hold the attitude Ney describes.\nNevertheless, there is a major problem for the view, viz., that on the\nface of it holding this sort of attitude is neither necessary nor\nsufficient for being a physicalist. \n\nTo see it is not necessary, consider such ancient philosophers as\nDemocritus or Lucretius. These philosophers are physicalists, or at\nleast are usually classified that way, i.e., since they held the\ndoctrine traditionally called \u2018materialism\u2019. But they did\nnot hold the attitude Ney describes, either implicitly or explicitly,\nfor physics (at least identified sociologically) did not exist in\ntheir day at all.\n\nIn response, one might adjust the attitudinal view so that the\n\u2018physics\u2019 towards which one holds the relevant attitude is\nnot identified sociologically, but is instead understood as a certain\nsort of theory considered in the abstract. But then further problems\narise. First, it is now difficult to see the difference between\nholding the relevant attitude and simply believing a thesis. If one\nresolves to be guided in one\u2019s ontology by the truth of a\nparticular theory, how is that different from just believing the\ntheory? Second, if one holds an attitude toward a particular theory,\nHempel\u2019s dilemma seems to arise again though in a slightly\ndifferent form. For which physical theory is meant? If one means\ncurrent physics, as in fact Ney suggests, then one might argue that\nthis is not an attitude that physicalists should reasonably hold,\nsince current physics is incomplete; and if one means ideal physics,\nit is hard to see what the content or nature of the attitude is.\n\nTo see that the attitude is not sufficient, imagine a situation in\nwhich physics postulates properties or objects which are like those\npostulated by traditional dualists; as Ney puts it imagine \u201cit\nis the year 3000 AD and physicists have been forced to introduce\nirreducible mental entities into their theory.\u201d (2008, p. 12).\nIn such a situation, a person might hold the attitude Ney describes,\nand yet intuitively not be a physicalist. \n\nIn response, Ney agrees that this is a possibility but points out,\nfirst, it would still be reasonable to criticize the people who hold\nthe attitude \u2013 for example, on the grounds that those who hold a\ndifferent attitude might have arrived at correct ontology more quickly\n\u2013 and, second, that it doesn\u2019t follow that the attitude\ndefinitive of physicalism is identical to the attitude definitive of\ndualism. (The ideas underlying this second point are (a) if one adopts\nthe attitudinal view about physicalism then one should in fairness\nadopt it about dualism as well; and (b) that from the fact that two\nattitudes coincide in a possible situation it does not follow that\nthey are identical.) However, while both these suggestions might be\ntrue, it is hard to see them as responding to the basic point that\nperson who holds the attitude Ney describes in the imagined situation\nis not correctly described as a physicalist. In principle, after all,\nsuch a person may be criticized in many ways; moreover, the fact that\nholding a particular attitude is not sufficient for being a\nphysicalist does not entail that doing so is necessary for being a\ndualist.\n5. The Case Against Physicalism\n\nHaving provided an answer to the interpretation question, I now turn\nto the truth question: is physicalism (as we have interpreted it so\nfar) true? I will first discuss three reasons for supposing that\nphysicalism is not true. Then I will consider the case for\nphysicalism.\n5.1 Qualia and Consciousness\n\nThe main argument against physicalism is usually thought to concern\nthe notion of qualia, the felt qualities of experience. The notion of\nqualia raises puzzles of its own, puzzles having to do with its\nconnection to other notions such as consciousness, introspection,\nepistemic access, acquaintance, the first-person perspective and so\non. However the idea that we will discuss here is the apparent\ncontradiction between the existence of qualia and physicalism.\n\nPerhaps the clearest version of this argument is Jackson\u2019s\nknowledge argument; see\n qualia: the knowledge argument.\n This argument asks us to imagine Mary, a famous neuroscientist\nconfined to a black and white room. Mary is forced to learn about the\nworld via black and white television and computers. However, despite\nthese hardships Mary learns (and therefore knows) all that physical\ntheory can teach her. Now, if physicalism were true, it is plausible\nto suppose that Mary knows everything about the world. And yet \u2014\nand here is Jackson\u2019s point \u2014 it seems she does not know\neverything. For, upon being released into the world of color, it will\nbecome obvious that, inside her room, she did not know what it is like\nfor both herself and others to see colors \u2014 that is, she did not\nknow about the qualia instantiated by particular experiences of seeing\ncolors. Following Jackson (1986), we may summarize the argument as\nfollows:\n\n\nP1. Mary (before her release) knows everything physical there is to\nknow about other people. \n\nP2. Mary (before her release) does not know everything there is to\nknow about other people (because she learns something about them on\nbeing released).\n\nConclusion. There are truths about other people (and herself) that\nescape the physicalist story.\n\n\nClearly this conclusion entails that physicalism is false: for if\nthere are truths which escape the physicalist story how can everything\nsupervene on the physical? So a physicalist must either reject a\npremise or show that the premises don\u2019t entail the\nconclusion.\n\nThere are many possible responses to this argument, but here I will\nbriefly mention only three. The first is the ability\nhypothesis due to Lawrence Nemerow (1988) and developed and\ndefended by David Lewis (1994). The ability hypothesis follows Ryle\n(1949) in drawing a sharp distinction between propositional knowledge\nor knowledge-that (such as \u2018Mary knows that snow is\nwhite\u2019) and knowledge-how (such as \u2018Mary knows how to ride\na bike\u2019), and then suggests that all Mary gains is the latter.\nOn the other hand, P2 would only be true if Mary gained propositional\nknowledge.\n\nA second response appeals to the distinction between a priori\nand a posteriori physicalism. As we saw above, the crucial\nclaim of a posteriori physicalism is that (13) \u2014 i.e.\nthe claim that S entails S* \u2014 is a\nposteriori. Since (13) is a posteriori, you would need\ncertain experience to know it. But, it is argued, Mary has not had\n(and cannot have) the relevant experience. Hence she does not know\n(13). On the other hand, the mere fact that Mary has not had (and\ncannot have) the experience to know (13) does not remove the\npossibility that (13) is true. Hence a posteriori physicalism\ncan avoid the knowledge argument. (It is an interesting question which\npremise of the knowledge argument is being attacked by this response.\nThe answer depends on whether (13) is physical or not: if (13) is\nphysical, then the response attacks P1. But if (13) is not physical,\nthe response is that the argument is invalid.).\n\nA third response is to distinguish between various conceptions of the\nphysical. We saw above that potentially the class of properties\ndefined by the theory-conception of the physical was distinct from the\nclass of properties defined by the object-conception. But that\nsuggests that the first premise of the argument is open to\ninterpretation in either of two ways. On the other hand,\nJackson\u2019s thought experiment only seems to support the premise\nif it is interpreted in the one way, since Mary learns by learning all\nthat physical theory can teach her. But leaves open the\npossibility that one might appeal to the object-conception of the\nphysical to define a version of physicalism which evades the knowledge\nargument.\n\nOne of the most lively areas of philosophy of mind concerns the issue\nof which if any of these responses to the knowledge argument will be\nsuccessful. (See the papers in Ludlow, Nagasawa, and Stoljar 2004. See\nalso\n Qualia: The Knowledge Argument)\n The ability response raises questions about whether know-how is\ngenuinely non-propositional (cf. Lycan 1996, Loar 1997 and Stanley and\nWilliamson 2001), and about whether it gets the facts right to begin\nwith (Braddon Mitchell and Jackson 1996). As against a\nposteriori physicalism, it has been argued both that it rests on\na mistaken approach to the necessary a posteriori (Chalmers\n1996, 1999, Jackson 1998), and that the promise of the idea is\nchimerical anyway (cf. Stoljar 2000). The third response raises\nquestions about the distinction between the object and the theory\nconception of the physical and associated issues about dispositional\nand categorical properties, and also about the relation between\nphysicalism on the one hand, and a related view, sometimes called\nRussellian monism. See\n Russellian monism,\n as well as Chalmers 1996, Lockwood 1992, Stoljar 2000, 2001, Montero\n2010, 2015) \n5.2 Meaning and Intentionality\n\nPhilosophers of mind often divide the problems of physicalism into\ntwo: first, there are the problems of qualia, typified by the\nknowledge argument; second, there are problems of intentionality. The\nintentionality of mental states is their aboutness, their capacity to\nrepresent the world as being a certain way. One does not simply think,\none thinks of (or about) Vienna; similarly, one does\nnot simply believe, one believes that snow is white. Just as\nin the case of qualia, some of the puzzles of intentionality derive\nfrom facts internal to the notion, and from the relation of this\nnotion to the others such as rationality, inference and language; see\n Intentionality.\n But others derive from the fact that it seems difficult to square the\nfact that mental states have intentionality with physicalism. There\nare a number of ways of developing this criticism but much recent work\nhas concentrated on a certain line of argument that Saul Kripke has\nfound in the work of Wittgenstein (1982; see also\n Private Language).\n\nKripke\u2019s argument is best approached by first considering what\nis often called a dispositional theory of linguistic meaning.\nAccording to the dispositional theory, a word means what it does\n\u2014 for example, the word \u2018red\u2019 means red \u2014\nbecause speakers of the word are disposed to apply to word to red\nthings. Now, for a number of reasons, this sort of theory has been\nvery popular among physicalists. First, the concept of a disposition\nat issue here is clearly a concept that is compatible with\nphysicalism. After all, the mere fact that vases are fragile and sugar\ncubes are soluble (both are classic examples of dispositional\nproperties) does not cause a problem for physicalism, so why should\nthe idea that human beings have similar dispositional properties?\nSecond, it seems possible to develop the dispositional theory of\nlinguistic meaning so that it might apply also to intentionality.\nAccording to a dispositional theory of intentionality, a mental\nconcept would mean what it does because thinkers are disposed to\nemploy the concept in thought in a certain way. So a dispositional\ntheory seems to hold out the best promise of a theory of\nintentionality that is compatible with physicalism.\n\nKripke\u2019s argument is designed to destroy that promise. (In fact,\nKripke\u2019s argument is designed to destroy considerably more than\nthis: the conclusion of his argument is a paradoxical one to the\neffect that there can be no such a thing as a word\u2019s having a\nmeaning. However, we will concentrate on the aspects of the argument\nthat bear on physicalism.) In essence his argument is this. Imagine a\nsituation in which (a) the dispositional theory is true; (b) the word\n\u2018red\u2019 means red for a speaker S; and yet (c) the speaker\nmisapplies the word \u2014 for example, S is looking at a white thing\nthrough rose-tinted spectacles and calls it red. Now, in that\nsituation, it would seem that S is disposed to apply \u2018red\u2019\nto things which are (not merely red but)\neither-red-or-white-but-seen-through-rose-tinted-spectacles. But then,\nby the theory, the word \u2018red\u2019 means (not red but)\neither-red-or-white-as-seen-through-rose-tinted-spectacles. But that\ncontradicts our initial claim (b), that \u2018red\u2019 means red.\nIn other words, the dispositional theory, when combined with a true\nclaim about the meaning of word, plus a truism about meaning \u2014\nthat people can misapply meaningful words \u2014 leads to a\ncontradiction and is therefore false.\n\nHow might a physicalist respond to Kripke\u2019s argument? As with\nthe knowledge argument, there are many responses but here I will\nmention only two. The first response is to insist that Kripke\u2019s\nargument neglects the distinction between a priori and a\nposteriori physicalism. Kripke often does say that according to\nthe dispositionalist, one should be able to \u2018read off\u2019\ntruths about meaning from truths a physicalist can accept. (For a\nproposal like this, see Horwich 2000.) One problem with this proposal\nis, as we have seen, that its background account of the necessary\na posteriori is controversial. As we saw, a\nposteriori physicalists are committed to what we called the\nnon-derivation view about necessary a posteriori truths. But\nthe non-derivation view has come under attack in recent times.\n\nThe second response is to defend the dispositional theory against\nKripke\u2019s argument. One way to do this is to argue that the\nargument only works against a very simple dispositionalism, and that a\nmore complicated version of such a theory would avoid these problems.\n(For a proposal along these lines, see Fodor 1992 and the discussion\nin Braddon-Mitchell and Jackson 1996). A different proposal is to\nargue that Kripke\u2019s argument underestimates the complexity in\nthe notion of a disposition. The mere fact that in certain\ncircumstances someone would apply \u2018red\u2019 to white things\ndoes not mean that they are disposed to apply red to white things\n\u2014 after all, the mere fact that in certain circumstances\nsomething would burn does not mean that it is flammable in the\nordinary sense. (For a proposal along these lines see Hohwy 1998, and\nHeil and Martin 1998)\n\nAs with the knowledge argument, the issues surrounding Kripke\u2019s\nargument are very much wide open. But it is important to note that\nmost philosophers don\u2019t consider the issues of intentionality as\nseriously as the issue of qualia when it comes to physicalism. In\ndifferent vocabularies, for example, both Block (1995) and Chalmers\n(1996) distinguish between the intentional aspects of the mind or\nconsciousness, and the phenomenal aspects or qualia, and suggest that\nit is really the latter that is the central issue. As Chalmers notes\n(1996; p. 24), echoing Chomsky\u2019s famous distinction, the\nintentionality issue is a problem, but the qualia issue is a\nmystery.\n5.3 Numbers and Abstracta\n\nA third problem, which we mentioned briefly above, is the problem\nof abstracta (Rabin 2020). This concerns the status within\nphysicalism of abstract objects, i.e., entities apparently not located\nin space and time, such as numbers, properties and relations, or\npropositions.\n\nTo see the problem, suppose that abstract objects, if they exist,\nexist necessarily, i.e., in all possible worlds. If physicalism is\ntrue, then the facts about such objects must either be physical facts,\nor else bear a particular relation (grounding, realisation) to the\nphysical. But on the face of it, that is not so. Can one really say\nthat 5+7=12, for example, is realised in, or holds in virtue of, some\narrangement of atoms and void? Or can one say that it itself is a\nphysical fact or a fundamental physical fact? If not, physicalism is\nfalse: the property of being such that 5+7=12 obtains the actual world\nbut is neither identical to, nor grounded in or realized by, any\nphysical property. (Sometimes the problem of abstracta is formulated\nas concerning, not abstract objects such as numbers or properties, but\nthe grounding or realization facts themselves; see, e.g, Dasgupta\n2015. We will set this aside here.)\n\nThere are a number of responses to this problem in the literature; for\nan overview, see Rabin 2020, see also Dasgupta 2015 and Bennett 2017;\nfor more general discussion of physicalism and abstracta, see Montero\n2017, Schneider 2017, and Witmer 2017.\n\nOne response points out that, while the problem of abstracta confronts\nmany different versions of physicalism, it does not arise for\nsupervenience physicalism. After all, since numbers exist in all\npossible worlds, facts about them trivially supervene on the physical;\nany world identical to the actual world in physical respects will be\nidentical to it in respect of whether 5+7=12, because any world at all\nis identical to the actual world in that respect! But the difficulty\nhere is that supervenience physicalism seems, as we saw above, too\nweak anyway. Indeed, one might think that the example of abstracta is\nsimply a different way to bring out that it is too weak.\n\nAnother option is to adopt a version of nominalism, and deny the\nexistence of abstracta entirely. The problem with this option is that\ndefending nominalism about mathematics is no easy matter, and in any\ncase nominalism and physicalism are normally thought of as distinct\ncommitments.\n\nA third view, which seems more attractive than either of the two\nmentioned so far, is to expand the notion of a physical property that\nis in play in formulations of physicalism. For example, one might\ntreat the properties of abstract objects as topic-neutral in\nsomething like the sense discussed in connection with Smart and\nreductionism above (see section 3.1). Topic-neutral properties have\nthe interesting feature that, while they themselves are not physical,\nbut are capable of being instantiated in what is intuitively a\ncompletely physical world, or indeed what is intuitively a completely\nspiritual world or a world entirely made of water. If so, it becomes\npossible to understand physicalism so that the reference to\n\u2018physical properties\u2019 within it is understood more\ncorrectly as \u2018physical or topic-neutral properties\u2019. \n\nA final response to the problem does not expand the notion of the\nphysical as much as it restricts the scope of physicalism to\nproperties of a certain sort. One suggestion along these lines has\nbeen made by a number of writers (e.g. Rabin 2020, following Dasgupta\n2015) in the context of grounding physicalism, though perhaps the\nunderlying idea can be extended to other varieties as well. They\nsuggest that grounding physicalism, which we formulated above as (7),\nshould be revised to take the following form:\n\n(7*)\n Physicalism is true at a possible world w iff every\ngroundable property instantiated at w is either a\nphysical property or is grounded in a physical property.\n\n\nHere, a property is groundable just in case it is apt for being\ngrounded, i.e. it is the sort of property that can be either grounded\nor not. Ordinary psychological properties are presumably in this\nclass. If grounding physicalism is true, they are grounded in physical\nproperties, whereas if it is false, they are not grounded in physical\nproperties; either way, they are groundable properties. But\nmathematical properties and the properties of abstracta more generally\nmight in at least some instances not be groundable, they may\nfail to be properties that are apt for being grounded. If so, we have\nan alternative solution to the problem of abstracta: (7*) permits that\nsome properties of abstracta are not grounded in the physical, so long\nas they are ungroundable. \n5.4 Methodological Issues\n\nThe final argument I will consider against physicalism is of a more\nmethodological nature. It is sometimes suggested, not that physicalism\nis false, but that the entire \u2018project of physicalism\u2019\n\u2014 the project in philosophy of mind of debating whether\nphysicalism is true, and trying to establish or disprove its truth by\nphilosophical argument \u2014 is misguided. This sort of argument has\nbeen mounted by a number of writers, but perhaps its most vocal\nadvocate has been Noam Chomsky (2000; see also Searle 1992, 1999).\n\n\nIt is easiest to state Chomsky\u2019s criticism by beginning with two\npoints about methodological naturalism. In general it seems rational\nto agree with the methodological naturalists that the best hope for a\ntheoretical understanding of the world is by pursuing the methods\nwhich are typical of the sciences. It would then seem rational as a\nspecial case that our best hope for a theoretical understanding of\nconsciousness or experience is by pursuing the methods of the sciences\n\u2014 by pursuing, as we might put it, the naturalistic project with\nrespect to consciousness. So Chomsky\u2019s first point is that it is\nrational to pursue the naturalistic project with respect to\nconsciousness.\n\nChomsky\u2019s second point is that the physicalist project in\nphilosophy of mind is on the face of it rather different from the\nnaturalistic project. In the first place, the physicalist project is,\nas we have noted, usually thought of a piece of metaphysics. But there\nis nothing obviously metaphysical about the naturalistic project, it\nsimply raises questions about what we can hope to explain. In the\nsecond place, the physicalist project is normally thought of as being\namenable to philosophical argument, whereas it is unclear where\nphilosophical argument (if this is different from scientific argument)\nwould enter the naturalistic project. In short, there doesn\u2019t\nseem anything particularly \u2018philosophical\u2019 about the\nnaturalistic project \u2014 it simply applies the methods of science\nto consciousness. But the physicalist project is central to analytic\nphilosophy.\n\nIt is precisely at the place where the physicalist project departs\nfrom the naturalistic project that Chomsky\u2019s criticism begins to\ntake shape. For insofar as it is different from the naturalistic\nproject, there are a number of ways in which the physicalist project\nis questionable. First, it is hard to see what the project might be\n\u2014 it is true that throughout the history of philosophy and\nscience one encounters suggestions that one might find out about the\nworld in ways that are distinct from the ones used in the sciences,\nbut these suggestions have always been rather obscure. Second, it is\nhard to see how this sort of project could recommend itself to\nphysicalists themselves \u2014 such a project seems to be a\ndeparture from methodological naturalism but most physicalists endorse\nmethodological naturalism as a matter of fact. On the other hand, if\nthe physicalist project does not depart from the naturalistic project,\nthen the usual ways of talking and thinking about that project are\nhighly misleading. For example, it is misleading to speak of it as a\npiece of metaphysics as opposed to a piece of ordinary science.\n\nIn sum, Chomsky\u2019s criticism is best understood as a kind of\ndilemma. The physicalist project is either identical to the\nnaturalistic project or it is not. If it is identical, then the\nlanguage and concepts that shape the project are potentially extremely\nmisleading; but if it is not identical, then there are a number of\nways in which it is illegitimate.\n\nHow is one to respond to this criticism? In my view, the strongest\nanswer to Chomsky accepts the first horn of his dilemma and suggests\nthat what philosophers of mind are really concerned with is the\nnaturalistic project. Now, of course, what concerns them is not so\nmuch the details of the project \u2014 that would not distinguish\nthem from working scientists. Rather they are concerned with what the\nnature of the project and what its potential limits might be.\n\nThis theme might be developed in several ways, but one well-known\ndevelopment of it has been suggested by Thomas Nagel (1983) and\nBernard Williams (1985). According to them, any form of scientific\ninquiry will at least be objective, or will result in an objective\npicture of the world. On the other hand, we have a number of arguments\n\u2014 the most prominent being the knowledge argument \u2014 which\nplausibly show that there is no place for experience or qualia in a\nworld that is described in purely objective terms. If Nagel and\nWilliams are right that any form of scientific inquiry will yield a\ndescription of the world in objective terms, the knowledge argument is\nnothing less than a negative argument to the effect that the\nnaturalistic project with respect to consciousness will not\nsucceed.\n\nIf what is at issue is the limits of the naturalist project, why is\nthe debate so often construed as a metaphysical debate rather than a\ndebate about the limits of inquiry? In answer to this question, we\nneed to sharply divorce the background metaphysical framework within\nwhich the problems of philosophy of mind find their expression, and\nthe problems themselves. Physicalism is the background metaphysical\nassumption against which the problems of philosophy of mind are posed\nand discussed. Given that assumption, the question of the limits of\nthe naturalistic project just is the question of whether\nthere can be experience in a world that is totally physical.\nNevertheless, when properly understood, the problems that philosophers\nof mind are interested in are not with the framework themselves, and\nto that extent are not metaphysical. Thus, the common phrase\n\u2018metaphysics of mind\u2019 is misleading.\n6. The Case for Physicalism\n\nHaving considered one side of the truth question, I will turn finally\nto the other: what reason is there for believing that physicalism is\ntrue?\n\nThe first thing to say when considering the truth of physicalism is\nthat we live in an overwhelmingly physicalist or materialist\nintellectual culture. The result is that, as things currently stand,\nthe standards of argumentation required to persuade someone of the\ntruth of physicalism are much lower than the standards required to\npersuade someone of its negation. (The point here is a perfectly\ngeneral one: if you already believe or want something to be true, you\nare likely to accept fairly low standards of argumentation for its\ntruth.)\n\nHowever, while it might be difficult to assess dispassionately the\narguments for or against physicalism, this is still something we\nshould endeavor to do. Here I will review two arguments that are\ncommonly thought to establish the truth of physicalism. What unites\nthe arguments is that each takes something from the physicalist\nworld-picture which we considered previously and tries to establish\nthe metaphysical this of physicalism.\n\nThe first argument is (what I will call) The Argument from Causal\nClosure. The first premise of this argument is the thesis of the\nCausal Closure of the Physical \u2014 that is, the thesis that every\nevent which has a cause has a physical cause. The second premise is\nthat mental events cause physical events \u2014 for example we\nnormally think that events such as wanting to raise your arm (a mental\nevent) cause events such as the raising of your arm (a physical\nevent). The third premise of the argument is a principle of causation\nthat is often called the exclusion principle (Kim 1993, Yablo 1992,\nBennett 2003). The correct formulation of the exclusion principle is a\nmatter of some controversy but a formulation that is both simple and\nplausible is the following:\n\nExclusion Principle\n\nIf an event e causes event e*, then there is no\nevent e# such that e# is non-supervenient on\ne and e# causes e*.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is the mental events are supervenient\non physical events, or more briefly that physicalism is true. For of\ncourse, if the thesis of Causal Closure is true then behavioral events\nhave physical causes, and if mental events also cause behavioral\nevents, then they must supervene on the physical if the exclusion\nprinciple is true. \n\nThe Argument from Causal Closure is perhaps the dominant argument for\nphysicalism in the literature today. But it is somewhat unclear\nwhether it is successful. (For some discussion see,\n Mental Causation).\n One response for the anti-physicalist is to reject the second premise\nand to adopt a version of what is called epiphenomenalism, the view\nthat mental events are caused by, and yet do not cause, physical\nevents. The argument against this position is usually epistemological:\nif pains don\u2019t cause pain behavior how can it be that your\ntelling me that you are in pain gives me any reason for supposing you\nare? It might seem that epiphenomenalists are in trouble here, but as\na number of recent philosophers have argued, the issues here are very\nfar from being settled (Chalmers 1996, Hyslop 1999). The crucial point\nis that the causal theory of evidence is open to serious\ncounterexamples so it is unclear that it can be used against\nepiphenomenalism effectively.\n\nA different sort of response is to reject the causal principles on\nwhich the argument is based. As against the exclusion principle, for\nexample, it is often pointed out that certain events are\noverdetermined. The classic example is the firing squad: both the\nfiring by soldier A and by soldier B caused the prisoner\u2019s death\nbut since these are distinct firings, the exclusion principle is\nfalse. However, while this line of response is suggestive, it is in\nfact rather limited. It is true that the case of the firing squad\nrepresents an exception to the exclusion principle \u2014 an\nexception that the principle must be emended to accommodate. But is\ndifficult to believe that it represents an exception that can be\nwidespread. A more searching response is to reject the very idea of\ncausal closure on the grounds, perhaps, that (as Bertrand Russell\n(1917) famously argued) causation plays no role in a mature portrayal\nof the world. Once again, however, the promise of this response is\nmore imagined than real. While it is true that many sciences do not\nexplicitly use the notion of causation, it is extremely unlikely that\nthey do not imply that various causal claims are true.\n\nThe second argument for physicalism is (what I will call) The\nArgument from Methodological Naturalism. The first premise of\nthis argument is that it is rational to be guided in one\u2019s\nmetaphysical commitments by the methods of natural science. Lying\nbehind this premise are the arguments of Quine and others that\nmetaphysics should not be approached in a way that is distinct from\nthe sciences but should rather be thought of as continuous with it.\nThe second premise of the argument is that, as a matter of fact, the\nmetaphysical picture of the world that one is led to by the methods of\nnatural science is physicalism. The conclusion is that it is rational\nto believe physicalism, or, more briefly that physicalism is true.\n\nThe Argument from Methodological Naturalism has received somewhat less\nattention in the literature than the Argument from Causal Closure. But\nit seems just as persuasive \u2014 in fact, rather more so. For how\nmight one respond? One possibility is to reject its first premise. But\nthis is not something that most people are attracted to (or at least\nare attracted to explicitly.)\n\nThe other possibility is to reject its second premise. However, if\nphysicalism can be clearly stated \u2014 admittedly, this is a big\n\u2018if\u2019 \u2014 it is not terribly clear what this would\namount to or what the motivation for it would be. In the first place,\nour earlier discussion shows that physicalism is not inconsistent with\nexplanatory autonomy of the various sciences, so that one should not\nreject physicalism merely because one can\u2019t see how to reduce\nthose sciences to others. In the second place, while it is perfectly\ntrue that there are examples of non-physicalist approaches to the\nworld \u2014 vitalism in biology is perhaps the best example \u2014\nthis is beside the point. The second premise of the Argument from\nMethodological Naturalism does not deny that other views are possible,\nit simply says that physicalism is the most likely view at the moment.\nFinally, one might be inclined to appeal to arguments such as the\nknowledge argument to show that physicalism is false, and hence that\nmethodological naturalism could not show that physicalism is false.\nHowever, this suggestion represents a sort of confusion about the\nknowledge argument. As we saw above, if successful the knowledge\nargument suggests, not simply that physicalism is false but that any\napproach to the world that is compatible with methodological\nnaturalism is false. But if that is so, it is mistaken to suppose that\nthe knowledge argument gives one any reason to endorse\nanti-physicalism if that is supposed to be a position compatible with\nmethodological naturalism.",
