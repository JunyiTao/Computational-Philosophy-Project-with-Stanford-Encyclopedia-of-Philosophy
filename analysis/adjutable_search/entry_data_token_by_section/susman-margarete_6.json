    "main_text": "The Emancipation of Women and the Question of Gender Relations\n7. The Emancipation of Women and the Question of Gender Relations\n\nWhile Susman\u2019s approach to gender and the status of women in\nmodern culture and society had initially been framed in Of the\nMeaning of Love (1912), which was discussed in section 3, above,\nher thinking on these subjects developed during WWI, the Weimar\nRepublic, and afterwards, in their wake, as the debate on gender and\nwomen underwent radical changes. Starting with \u201cDie Revolution\nund die Frau\u201d (1918 [NFF 117\u2013128]), a number of essays reflect\nher increasing attention to the political dimension of these concerns,\nwhose particular cultural implications she further explores in\nFrauen der Romantik (Women of the Romantic Period,\n1929) and Deutung einer grossen Liebe: Goethe und Charlotte von\nStein (Interpretation of a Great Love: Goethe and Charlotte\nvon Stein, 1951).\n\nSusman mounts her critique of the muting of the female voice on an\nanalysis of the image of domesticated woman that male culture has\ncreated and reinforced over the centuries. First formulated in Of\nthe Meaning of Love, Susman\u2019s analysis of the symbolical\nrepresentation of women as a form of domination is now brought into\nsharper focus as a \u201cstruggle about language and image\u201d\n(\u201cFrauenproblem\u201d, 1926: 432). For Susman, the decisive\nresponse to the crisis of the time consists in women taking back and\nowning their own image: \u201cThe tough struggle between man\u2019s\nimage of the woman and of woman herself\u201d is \u201cthe whole\nproblem of woman\u201d (1926: 433). This work, which, according to\nSusman, will ultimately determine the success of women\u2019s\nmovement, involves the renegotiation of the symbolic representation of\nthe role and place of women in culture and society.\n\nFrauen der Romantik examines the lives of five German women,\ntracking the untold story of the women\u2019s perspective of a\nliterary movement that claimed to be all about love but cast women as\nultimately uncreative but fortunate beneficiaries of male fantasy. A\nperceptive critique of Romanticism\u2019s necrophiliac tendencies,\nwhose renewal Susman witnessed under the banner of the rise of\nreactionary forces in Weimar Germany, the study also examined the\nundercurrents of religious difference under whose sign the prominent\nJewish Romantics Dorothea von Schlegel (Moses Mendelssohn\u2019s\noldest daughter) and Rahel Varnhagen sought to find their own way,\nalbeit in an often palpably restricted fashion. Similarly, Deutung\neiner grossen Liebe seeks to present a great albeit often\nconflicted dialogue between Goethe and the woman who became his\nguiding star, a relationship that was profoundly affected by the way\nthe feminine gender role determined the lives of the even most\ncreative and independent minds.\n\nSusman views the rising up of women in the context of two other\nrevolutions: the proletarian and the sexual revolution:\n\n\n[T]his is the third revolution of our world: the woman who enters as\nindependent human being with her own problems and own reality the\nhitherto exclusively male world. (\u201cM\u00e4chte im\nWeltgeschehen\u201d, hereafter MW, 654; see also\n\u201cAufl\u00f6sung und Werden in unserer Zeit\u201d [Dissolution\nand Becoming in Our Age], 1928, hereafter AW, 342 and 348)\n\n\nIn order to comprehend the full ramifications of women\u2019s\nrevolution, Susman points out, we need to understand it as part of the\nprofound sea change that these three revolutions bring about\ntogether.\n\nSusman sees this liberation as something of a Pyrrhic victory, one\nthat comes at the cost of the radical, destabilizing loss of all\ntraditionally-valued certainties (AW 347). She casts the situation\ndryly:\n\n\nWhen finally almost overnight the doors opened to the desired world\nthis took place in the most tremendous collapse. It turned out: man\nhad no world at all to offer to woman; all his orders and laws had\ndisintegrated. (WF 1933 [GK 161])\n\n\nIt is not just that marriage and motherhood along with traditional\nideas of femininity had been dissolved, but that the question\n\u201cwhere is the world that a mother can offer her child?\u201d no\nlonger had an answer (GK 165). As women experience cataclysmic\ndevelopments of these kinds more profoundly and more existentially\nthan men, it is up to women to be leaders during these processes of\ncultural transition (GK 174). The task, as Susman understands it, is\nnot for women to cease being women, but, on the contrary, to take back\nand appropriate \u201cmale existence in order to achieve full female\nhumanity\u201d (GK 175). Woman, then, \u201cmust not only recognize,\nunderstand, and love man\u2014she must in order to grasp his life\nreally become man\u201d (GK 175). In other words, woman, according to\nSusman, has to fully own the world even though\u2014and\nbecause\u2014it has been defined by man and has excluded her for\nmillennia. Only a full and radical appropriation of maleness, she\nsuggests, will render the transformation of woman into a new,\nself-determined female possible, and this transformation has already\nbegun (GK 176). As she notes elsewhere:\n\n\nIn the mind of the most modest and uneducated ordinary workingwoman\nstill lives today a greater and deeper dream of life than in the most\nsignificant man of our world completely dedicated to matter of facts\nand work. (MW 654)\n\n\nWorld War 1 and the social and political revolutions that followed\nbrought about a fundamental change in inter-human relationships:\n\u201cthe old forms of love are dead\u201d (WF 1933 [GK 173]). The\ntime-honored conventions of binding the \u201cworld powers\u201d\nlove and sex into culturally stable forms through the mediating power\nof Eros have become obsolete and there are no non-anachronistic\nconceptions of woman and gender relations to turn to. The contemporary\nwoman has become metaphysically homeless (WF 1933 [GK 163], \u201cDas\nFrauenproblem in der gegenw\u00e4rtigen Welt\u201d, 146 and 151 and\nMW). For Susman, this is the most formidable challenge: women are\nforced to imagine themselves anew in a world marked by radical change.\nIn this time of transition, they must create themselves by reimagining\nlove and sex through an engagement with Eros of an unprecedented form\n(WF 1933 [GK 173]; \u201cDas Frauenproblem\u201d, and MW). In 1933,\non the eve of the demise of the Weimar Republic, Susman writes that\nthe women\u2019s movement no longer exists in its original form,\nhaving transformed into the common project shared by women and men\nalike to bring about a human renewal. In a changed world this no\nlonger means submission to the design of a male vision: \u201cMen\ndesign the ways; women walk them. It is her way to walk the way\nherself\u201d (WF 1933 [GK 177]).\n",
