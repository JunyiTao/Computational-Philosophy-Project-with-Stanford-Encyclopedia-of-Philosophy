    "main_text": "Returning to the Everyday Lifeworld: Not One || Zen\u2019s Freedom\n9. Concluding Remarks\n\nThis article has articulated a Zen Philosophy, though as\nanti-philosophy, by thematizing such topics as \u201covercoming\ndualism,\u201d \u201cZen-seeing,\u201d \u201cZen\u2019s\nunderstanding of time and space,\u201d \u201cZen person,\u201d and\n\u201cZen freedom,\u201d and in the process has noted a sense of the\nmovement from \u201cnot two\u201d to \u201cnot one.\u201d This was\nto indicate Zen\u2019s sense of achieving personhood. Zen\u2019s\nmethods of meditative practice are concrete ways for an individual to\nbecome a Zen person by awakening to the fundamental reality in the\neveryday human lifeworld. In so doing, it teaches us to\nparticipate in the whole, and to express freedom in daily action, by\nshowing one\u2019s \u201coriginal face\u201d right here-now and\nright in front of one\u2019s eyes. \n\nIn closing this entry, a cautionary remark is in order, however: all\nof the preceding accounts are simply a heuristic way of\nconceptually articulating Zen philosophy. Or to use a Zen phrase, this\nconceptual articulation is only \u201ca finger pointing to the\nmoon,\u201d where Zen insists that there should not be a confounding\nof the moon with a finger. In Zen language, the moon metaphorically\ndesignates an experience of enlightenment and the finger a linguistic\nor reflective endeavor.\n",
