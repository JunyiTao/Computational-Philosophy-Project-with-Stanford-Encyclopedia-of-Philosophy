    "main_text": "The World and Rational Cosmology\n4. The World and Rational Cosmology\n\nThe second discipline of rationalist metaphysics rejected by Kant is\nRational Cosmology. Rational cosmology is concerned with the arguments\nabout the nature and constitution of the \u201cworld,\u201d\nunderstood as the sum-total of all appearances (objects and events in\nspace and time) (A420/B448). The arguments about the world occupy an\nespecially important place in Kant\u2019s rejection of metaphysics.\nNot only does Kant address himself to the task of discounting the\nmetaphysical arguments in cosmology, but the resolution to some of\nthese conflicts provides, he claims, an indirect argument for his own\ntranscendental idealism.\n\nThe arguments about the world are referred to by Kant as\n\u201cantinomies\u201d because in the field of cosmology, reason\ngives rise to sets of opposing arguments (the \u201cthesis\u201d and\nthe \u201cantithesis\u201d) with respect to each issue. Thus, the\ncase here differs from the paralogisms (and, as we shall see, from the\nIdeal). The reason for this difference resides in the nature of the\nidea of reason in question. The idea of the \u201cworld\u201d\npurports to be an idea of an unconditioned but somehow still sensible\nobject (cf. A479/B509). Unlike the soul and God, which are clearly\nsupposed to be non-sensible metaphysical entities, the sum total of\nall appearances refers specifically to spatio-temporal objects or\nevents. Kant highlights this unique feature of the idea of the world\nby noting that whereas the ideas of the soul and God are\n\u201cpseudo-rational,\u201d the idea of the world is\n\u201cpseudo-empirical.\u201d It is precisely this feature of the\nidea (that it both purports to refer to a somehow sensible object AND\nthat it involves thinking that object as already given in its\nunconditioned totality) that leads to the two opposed sets of\narguments. For with respect to each problem addressed (the finitude\nvs. the infinitude of the world, freedom vs. causality, etc.), one can\neither adopt a broadly \u201cdogmatic\u201d (Platonic) or broadly\n\u201cempiricist\u201d (Epicurean) approach, each reflecting a\ndifferent way of thinking the totality of conditions (See\nA471\u20132/B499\u2013500). More specifically, one can either think\nthe unconditioned as an intelligible ground of appearances, or as the\ntotal (even if infinite) set of all appearances. Unfortunately, each\nof these conceptual strategies is unsatisfying. To accommodate the\nthesis interest in ultimate (intelligible) beginnings is to posit\nsomething \u201ctoo big\u201d for the understanding, something that\nis never to be met with empirically (e.g., freedom, ultimately simple\nsubstances). Thus, although the thesis positions satisfy\nreason\u2019s demand for the unconditioned, they do so by fleeing\n(however unwittingly) into an intelligible realm, by providing\nexplanations that abstract from that which is or could be given in any\nspatio-temporal experience. But adopting the empiricist approach is no\nmore rewarding, in the final analysis; although the antithesis\npositions remain securely lodged within \u201cnature\u2019s own\nresources,\u201d they can never measure up to the demands of\nreason\u2019s ideas. Such a strategy is \u201ctoo small\u201d for\nreason which, even despite its capacity to think beyond all standards\nof sense and by its demand for more thorough explanation. Worse, the\nantithesis arguments, in refusing to go beyond the spatio-temporal\nrealm, end up being just as dogmatic as their opposites, for the\nassumption is that whatever holds within space and time also holds\ngenerally. To assume this is to take what are for Kant merely\nsubjective features of our intuition (forms of sensibility, space and\ntime) to be universal ontological conditions holding of everything\nwhatsoever. \n\nBecause both sides to the cosmological disputes seem to be able to\nargue successfully against the opposite, Kant finds in the antinomies\na dramatic exhibition of the \u201cconflict\u201d into which reason\ninevitably falls (and in which it will remain) so long as it fails to\nadopt his own transcendental distinction between appearances and\nthings in themselves. The historical debacle of reason\u2019s\nconflict with itself provides Kant with a dramatic exhibition of the\nvacillation of reason between two alternatives, neither of which it\ncan accept (or dismiss) without dissatisfaction. Left unresolved, this\nconflict leads to the \u201ceuthanasia of pure reason\u201d\n(A407/B434), in the sense of provoking skeptical despair.\n",
