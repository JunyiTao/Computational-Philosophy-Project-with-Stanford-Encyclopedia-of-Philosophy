Late Nineteenth-Century Debates: Roux and Driesch\n\nWilhelm Roux adopted much the same approach as Weismann\u2019s and\nso, at first, did Hans Driesch. Yet their experiments ultimately led\nto new approaches and revised interpretations of what was at issue\nwith epigenesist and preformationist accounts of development\n(Maienschein 1991b and Weber 2022). In 1888, Roux published results of\nhis experiments on frog eggs. Working on the assumption of a mosaic\ntype preformationism, Roux was persuaded that starting from the very\nfirst cell division, each cell would be different because it was\nalready predetermined to be different.\n\nRoux proposed an experiment, a simple and elegant experiment on the\nface of it. He proposed to take a developing frog egg, after the first\ncell division, and to separate the two cells. Finding it impossible to\nseparate the two cells, however, he simply killed one by inserting a\nhot needle. That cell just hung there like a blob of material and no\nlonger differentiated. The other half organism, or single cell\nproceeded to develop, in Roux\u2019s interpretation, as it normally\nwould have developed (Roux 1888). The half became a half, just as it\nshould if it were already preformed or predetermined as to its fate in\nthe organism. Roux had, it seemed, confirmed the mosaic\nhypothesis.\n\nA few years later, Driesch was working at Naples and had access to sea\nurchin eggs. Fortunately, because of Oscar and his brother Richard\nHertwig\u2019s study of these eggs, Driesch knew that if he shook the\ntwo cells they would separate completely. Driesch reported agreeing\nwith Roux and intending to confirm Roux\u2019s results. But since the\nsea urchin eggs could actually be separated, he felt that his results\nwould be even more convincing. Imagine his surprise when he looked the\nnext morning after separating the eggs and found not two half embryos\nbut two smaller sized urchin larvae. As he noted,\n\n\nI must confess that the idea of a free-swimming hemisphere or a half\ngastrula open lengthwise seemed rather extraordinary. I thought the\nformations would probably die.\n\n\nNot so.\n\n\nInstead, the next morning I found in their respective dishes typical,\nactively swimming blastulae of half size. (Driesch 1892 [1964:\n46])\n\n\nIn later experiments they developed even further, into apparently\nperfectly normal pluteus larvae, and even the four cell stage could do\nthe same.\n\nDriesch concluded with an epigenetic account, but an epigenesis\nrelying strictly on materialistic factors (at least that was his\ninitial response; Driesch did turn later to a version of vitalism).\nThe early embryo retains its totipotency, he concluded. The fertilized\negg clearly has the capacity to become a whole organism and so,\napparently, do the cells after the early cell divisions. Not a mosaic\nof cells already predetermined by their inherited determinants in the\nnucleus, the early embryonic stages are instead a population of\nseparate totipotent organisms, each capable of becoming a whole. It is\nonly the interactions among them under normal conditions that lead to\na complex, organized, integrated differentiated organism.\n\nIt might seem that Roux would have had to acknowledge the superiority\nof Driesch\u2019s approach, since Driesch had actually separated the\ncells. But no. Instead Roux countered with an additional hypothesis.\nThe nucleus retains the capacity to adapt, especially in simpler\norganisms. They need the capacity to regenerate when injured, and\ntherefore the mosaic determination simply has not occurred yet. Each\ncell retains a \u201creserve idioplasm\u201d, he argued, and this\nprovides the necessary backup determination needed to form a whole\norganism (see Churchill 1966, 1973).\n\nIt seems that Wheeler was right. Roux, Weismann, and others had\ndecided that development must be guided by predetermined mosaic\ndifferences. Preformation, stability, and predictability stood on one\nside, with epigenesis, dynamic process, and change on the other. And,\nas Wheeler noted, by 1899 the way forward lay between the extremes of\nstrict preformation or epigenesis. Wheeler\u2019s dissertation\ndirector Charles Otis Whitman agreed. Whitman felt that what biology\nneeded was a clear statement of the alternative views, and then\nmovement to a new standpoint examining how much depends on the\norganism\u2019s developmental response to external conditions drawing\non preformation, rather than on programmed internal unfolding\nalone.\n\nWhitman, Edmund Beecher Wilson, and others at the Marine Biological\nLaboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, dedicated considerable energy\nto discovering the nature of each cell and its internal organization\nand relationships, in an attempt to discover the relative\ncontributions of preformation and epigenetic development to a\nmaterialistic explanation of development. By the early twentieth\ncentury, they had moved toward an understanding that included a\nfertilized egg that was to some extent preorganized and\ndifferentiated, including in the nuclear chromosomes, and also a\ncapacity of the individual organism to respond to changes in its\nenvironment or to self-regulate. This was epigenesis allowing some\nminimal predeterminism.\n",
