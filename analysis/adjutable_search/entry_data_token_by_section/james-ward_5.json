    "main_text": "Natural Theology\n6. Legacy\n\n\nWard\u2019s metaphysics has had very little impact upon later\nAnglo-American philosophy, but it was not without influence in the\nCambridge philosophical world in the first two or three decades of the\ntwentieth century. Bertrand Russell explicitly recognizes his\nindebtedness to his teacher in his scholarly study of 1900, A\nCritical Examination of the Philosophy of Leibniz. Although he\ncomplained that Ward\u2019s philosophy was \u2018dull and\nantiquate\u2019 in a letter to Ottoline Morrell (Griffin 1991: 39), it\nis arguable that the influence run deeper, as Russell cultivated an\ninterest in those questions at the verge between natural philosophy,\nphilosophy of mind and metaphysics that so much mattered to Ward. This\nbecomes clear as soon as one considers that he is not solely the\ncelebrated author of \u2018On Denoting\u2019 (1905) and The\nPrinciples of Mathematics (1903), but also of The Analysis of\nMind (1921) and The Analysis of Matter (1927).\n\n\nOther Cambridge thinkers that might have been influenced by Ward are\nJohn Ellis McTaggart, C. D. Broad, and Alfred North Whitehead. In\nThe Nature of Existence (1921/1927) McTaggart developed a\nsystem of idealistic metaphysics that bears some resemblance with\nLeibniz\u2019s theory of monads. Broad says in his\n\u2018Autobiography\u2019 (1959) that his idealist professor had\n\u2018little influence\u2019 on his thought (50), yet he favorably\n(and acutely) reviewed Ward\u2019s The Realm of Ends and\ndevoted an important study to Leibniz\u2019s philosophy. Arguably,\nthe greatest ascertained influence was exerted on Alfred North\nWhitehead; the system of metaphysics that he exposed in Process\nand Reality (1929) incorporates all the crucial ideas of\nWard\u2019s philosophy of nature, while his conception of the\nGod-World relationship is a way of bringing to completion Ward\u2019s\nfragmentary account. (Basile 2009: 61\u201362, 142\u201343) One\nmight reasonably expect that, outside of Cambridge, his philosophy\nshould have been taken into serious consideration by thinkers with an\ninterest in Naturphilosophie, and especially so by a\nphilosopher usually referred to as an \u2018idealist\u2019 such as\nRobin G. Collingwood, but there seems to be no documentary evidence of\nthis. American process philosopher and theologian Charles Hartshorne,\nwhose speculative system approximates to Whitehead\u2019s, displays\nin print knowledge of Ward\u2019s works. (1963: 19)\n\n\nWard\u2019s philosophy is little known today and scholarly\ndiscussions of his thought are scanty. In the widely read A\nHundred Years of Philosophy, John Passmore compares it\nunfavourably with McTaggart\u2019s: \u201cIn McTaggart\u2019s case,\nthe difficulty is to give a summary account of a highly intricate\npattern of argument; in Ward\u2019s case, to decide what he really\nmeant to say on the issues of central philosophical importance\u201d\n(82). In an age in love with logical technicalities, this is like\nputting a heavy stone on the philosopher\u2019s grave.\n\n\nPassmore\u2019s judgment is not entirely justified; the essentials\nof Ward\u2019s philosophical credo are clear enough. The\nreasons for the oblivion in which his thought has fallen are historical\nand have much to do with a general shift of philosophical concerns, as\nhe belonged to a philosophical world that was swept away as a\nwhole by the mounting tide of linguistic philosophy\u2014a world\nin which other towering figures were, just to mention a few names,\nforgotten but truly exceptional personalities like Francis Herbert\nBradley, Bernard Bosanquet, Samuel Alexander, and George Santayana. It\nis not a sheer accident that Ward\u2019s chair was inherited by Moore, and\nthen by Wittgenstein. Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to regard his\nphilosophy as little more than a relic from the past. The question\nconcerning the mind\u2019s place in nature is still at very centre of\nphilosophical debate; panpsychism has been recently recognized as a\nhypothesis worth contemplating by acclaimed philosophers such as Nagel\n(1979) and Chalmers (1996); more surprisingly perhaps, the idea that\nthe riddle of the universe might be solved by a theory of interacting\nmonads has resurfaced in recent \u2018revisionary\u2019 work by Galen\nStrawson (2006: 274).\n\n\nAt a deeper level, Ward\u2019s thought is admirable for his sincere\nattachment to the ideal of philosophical speculation as a non-dogmatic\nsource of orientation. His belief in the creative powers and\n\u2018freedom\u2019 of the monad\u2014which he defended from\nPeircian tychism, scientistic determinism and traditional\ntheism\u2014implicitly grounds an ethics of responsibility, while his\nevolutionary theism (a form of meliorism, rather than of\noptimism) inspires a confident yet not naive attitude towards\nlife and its challenges. Surely, Ward\u2019s own\nvicissitudes\u2014from debilitating poverty to public recognition as\nCambridge Professor of Mental Philosophy\u2014are reflected in his\ngrand vision of reality as comprising an indefinite number of conative\nsubjects obstinately striving to achieve self-realization and social\nharmonization; in this only sustained, as he was wont to say, by\n\u2018faith in light to come\u2019 (1927: 66).\n",
