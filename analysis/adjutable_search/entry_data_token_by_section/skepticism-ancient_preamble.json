    "main_text": "\n\nThe Greek word skepsis means investigation. Literally, a\n\u201cskeptic\u201d is an inquirer. Not all ancient philosophers\nwhom in retrospect we call \u201cskeptics\u201d refer to themselves\nas such. Nevertheless, they all embrace ways of life that are devoted\nto inquiry. Ancient skepticism is as much concerned with belief\nas with knowledge. As long as knowledge has not been attained, the\nskeptics aim not to affirm anything. This gives rise to their most\ncontroversial ambition: a life without belief.\n\nAncient skepticism is, for the most part, a phenomenon of\nPost-Classical, Hellenistic philosophy. The Academic and Pyrrhonian\nskeptical movements begin roughly in the third century BCE, and end\nwith Sextus Empiricus in the second century CE. Hellenistic philosophy\nis a large-scale conversation, not unlike philosophy today. The\nskeptics (among them Pyrrho, Timon, Arcesilaus, Carneades,\nAenesidemus, and Sextus Empiricus) do engage with Pre-Socratic\nphilosophy, Socrates, Protagorean relativism, Plato, and perhaps\nAristotle. But their contemporary and principal interlocutors are\nEpicureans, Stoics, Cynics, and Megarian logicians (cf. Long 2006, ch.\n4 and 5).\n",
