    "main_text": "The Naturalistic Fallacy\n1. The Naturalistic Fallacy\n\n\nMoore famously claimed that naturalists were guilty of what he called\nthe \u201cnaturalistic fallacy.\u201d In particular, Moore accused\nanyone who infers that X is good from any proposition\nabout X\u2019s natural properties of having committed the\nnaturalistic fallacy. Assuming that being pleasant is a natural\nproperty, for example, someone who infers that drinking beer is good\nfrom the premise that drinking beer is pleasant is supposed to have\ncommitted the naturalistic fallacy. The intuitive idea is that\nevaluative conclusions require at least one evaluative\npremise\u2014purely factual premises about the naturalistic features\nof things do not entail or even support evaluative conclusions. Moore\nhimself focused on goodness, but if the argument works for goodness\nthen it seems likely to generalize to other moral properties.\n\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, Moore in effect also argues that most forms\nof non-naturalism are also guilty of what he calls the naturalistic\nfallacy. In particular, he argues that so-called \u201cmetaphysical ethics,\u201d\naccording to which goodness is a non-natural property existing in\n\u201csupersensible reality\u201d also are guilty of the naturalistic fallacy.\nSo, for example, a view according to which goodness is the property of\nbeing commanded by God where God is understood as existing outside of\nNature is also charged with having committed the naturalistic fallacy.\nThis suggests that the naturalistic fallacy is not well named in that\nit is not specifically a problem for naturalists, and Moore admits as\nmuch. If the point were purely terminological then it would be trifling\nbut an important philosophical point is at stake here. The real force\nof Moore\u2019s argument is supposed to be that attempts to reduce moral\nproperties to anything else are doomed to fail. This is why Moore\u2019s own\nview of goodness as sui generis and irreducible is supposed to\navoid the naturalistic fallacy. Since the\nreductionist/anti-reductionist distinction cuts across the\nnaturalist/non-naturalist distinction (properly understood), this\nsuggests that the real target of Moore\u2019s argument is reductionism\nrather than naturalism. Admittedly, if Moore is right then at least\nreductionist forms of naturalism fall prey to the naturalistic fallacy\nand it is therefore still relevant to the debate over naturalism and\nnon-naturalism. However, the non-naturalist will need a separate\nargument against those naturalists who hold that moral properties\nnatural but irreducible. As noted in the Introduction, Moore seems to\nhave ignored the distinction between naturalism and reductionism and\nthis is one important case in which that mistake seems important.\n\n\nThe naturalistic fallacy is very poorly named indeed (a point also\nmade by Bernard Williams; see Williams 1985: 121\u2013122). For not\nonly is it not especially a problem for naturalists, it is also not\nreally a fallacy even if Moore is right that it embodies a mistake of\nsome kind.  For it is highly uncharitable to charge anyone who\nadvances the sorts of arguments to which Moore alludes as having\ncommitted a logical fallacy. Rather, charity demands that we interpret\nsuch arguments as enthymematic, and usually this is easy enough. For\nexample, we should understand \u2018X is pleasant,\ntherefore X is good\u2019 as an enthymeme whose suppressed\npremise is \u2018Whatever is pleasant is good\u2019. Nor must the\nnon-naturalist even quarrel with such a suppressed premise. One can\nallow that goodness is itself a non-natural property but grant that\nall pleasant things necessarily have that non-natural property. What\nthe non-naturalist must reject is the thesis that such suppressed\npremises are true in virtue of the identity of goodness with the\nnatural property in question (being pleasant, in this case). So the\nso-called naturalistic fallacy is no fallacy at all.  Rather, if Moore\nis right then the so-called naturalistic fallacy actually embodies a\nmistaken belief about the reducibility of goodness, perhaps the belief\nthat \u2018good\u2019 just means \u2018pleasant\u2019 (or\nwhatever). However, to suppose that whenever someone is metaphysically\nor semantically confused he is guilty of a \u2018fallacy\u2019 robs\nthe term of its more standard and useful meaning. This point was made\nvery clearly by W.K. Frankena in a landmark article published\nin Mind (Frankena 1939).\n\n\nFinally, as Frankena also nicely pointed out, it cannot be assumed\nat the outset that what Moore calls the naturalistic fallacy really is\na mistake of any kind. For certain naturalists could then reasonably\ncomplain that the central question has been begged. The naturalist\nproposes a certain kind of definition of some moral term and the\nnon-naturalist then simply asserts that anyone who thinks such\ndefinitions are possible is mistaken. If we want to find a\nnon-question-begging argument against naturalism then we must look\nbeyond the so-called \u201cnaturalistic fallacy.\u201d\n",
