    "main_text": "Philosophy || Wittgenstein\n6.2 Wittgenstein\n\nOn March 10, 1928, Brouwer lectured in Vienna on his intuitionistic\nfoundations of mathematics. Ludwig Wittgenstein attended that lecture,\npersuaded by Herbert Feigl, who afterwards wrote about the hours he\nspent with Wittgenstein and others after the lecture: a great\nevent took place. Suddenly and very volubly Wittgenstein began talking\nphilosophy \u2013 at great length. Perhaps this was the turning\npoint, for ever since that time, 1929, when he moved to Cambridge\nUniversity, Wittgenstein was a philosopher again, and began to exert a\ntremendous influence.\n\nOthers dispute that Brouwer\u2019s lecture influenced\nWittgenstein\u2019s thinking (Hacker 1986, Hintikka 1992, Marion\n2003). In how far, if at all, Wittgenstein was influenced by\nBrouwer\u2019s ideas is not entirely clear, but there certainly are\ninteresting agreements and disagreements between their views. Marion\n(2003) argues that Wittgenstein\u2019s conception of mathematics as\ndescribed in the Tractatus is very close to that of Brouwer, and that\nWittgenstein agrees with the rejection of the Law of Excluded Middle\n(1929 manuscript, pp 155\u2013156 in Wittgenstein 1994) but disagrees\nwith Brouwer\u2019s arguments against it. Marion (2003) claims that\nWittgenstein\u2019s stance is more radical than Brouwer\u2019s in\nthat in the former\u2019s view the lack of validity of the Law of\nExcluded Middle in mathematics is a distinguishing feature of all\nmathematical propositions (as opposed to empirical propositions) and\nnot only a particularity of the mathematics of the infinite, as it is\nfor Brouwer.\n\nVeldman (forthcoming) discusses several points of (dis)agreement between\nBrouwer and Wittgenstein, such as the danger of logic, which,\naccording to both, may lead to constructions without mathematical\ncontent. One of the disagreements raised in the paper concerns\nWittgenstein\u2019s view that mathematics is a common undertaking,\nwhich is in stark contrast to Brouwer\u2019s Creating Subject and his\nview that mathematics is a languageless activity. \n",
