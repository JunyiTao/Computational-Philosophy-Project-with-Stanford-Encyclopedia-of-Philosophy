    "main_text": "Love as Robust Concern\n3. Love as Robust Concern\n\nAs this criticism of the union view indicates, many find caring about\nyour beloved for her sake to be a part of what it is to love her. The\nrobust concern view of love takes this to be the central and defining\nfeature of love (cf. Taylor 1976; Newton-Smith 1989; Soble 1990, 1997;\nLaFollette 1996; Frankfurt 1999; White 2001). As Taylor puts it:\n\nTo summarize: if x loves y\n then x wants to benefit and be with y etc., and he\n has these wants (or at least some of them) because he\n believes y has some determinate characteristics \u03c8 in\n virtue of which he thinks it worth while to benefit and be\n with y. He regards satisfaction of these wants as an end and\n not as a means towards some other end. [p. 157]\n\n\nIn conceiving of my love for you as constituted by my concern for you\nfor your sake, the robust concern view rejects the idea, central to\nthe union view, that love is to be understood in terms of the (literal\nor metaphorical) creation of a \u201cwe\u201d: I am the one who has\nthis concern for you, though it is nonetheless disinterested and so\nnot egoistic insofar as it is for your sake rather than for my\n own.[5]\n\nAt the heart of the robust concern view is the idea that love\n\u201cis neither affective nor cognitive. It is volitional\u201d\n(Frankfurt 1999, p. 129; see also Martin 2015). Frankfurt\ncontinues:\n\nThat a person cares about or that he loves something has less to do\nwith how things make him feel, or with his opinions about them, than\nwith the more or less stable motivational structures that shape his\npreferences and that guide and limit his conduct.\n\n\nThis account analyzes caring about someone for her sake as a matter of\nbeing motivated in certain ways, in part as a response to what happens\nto one\u2019s beloved. Of course, to understand love in terms of\ndesires is not to leave other emotional responses out in the cold, for\nthese emotions should be understood as consequences of desires. Thus,\njust as I can be emotionally crushed when one of my strong desires is\ndisappointed, so too I can be emotionally crushed when things\nsimilarly go badly for my beloved. In this way Frankfurt (1999)\ntacitly, and White (2001) more explicitly, acknowledge the way in\nwhich my caring for my beloved for her sake results in my identity\nbeing transformed through her influence insofar as I become vulnerable\nto things that happen to her.\n\nNot all robust concern theorists seem to accept this line, however; in\nparticular, Taylor (1976) and Soble (1990) seem to have a strongly\nindividualistic conception of persons that prevents my identity being\nbound up with my beloved in this sort of way, a kind of view that may\nseem to undermine the intuitive \u201cdepth\u201d that love seems to\nhave. (For more on this point, see Rorty 1986/1993.) In the middle is\nStump (2006), who follows Aquinas in understanding love to involve not\nonly the desire for your beloved\u2019s well-being but also a desire\nfor a certain kind of relationship with your beloved\u2014as a parent\nor spouse or sibling or priest or friend, for example\u2014a\nrelationship within which you share yourself with and connect yourself\nto your\n beloved.[6]\n\nOne source of worry about the robust concern view is that it involves\ntoo passive an understanding of one\u2019s beloved (Ebels-Duggan\n2008). The thought is that on the robust concern view the lover merely\ntries to discover what the beloved\u2019s well-being consists in and\nthen acts to promote that, potentially by thwarting the\nbeloved\u2019s own efforts when the lover thinks those efforts would\nharm her well-being. This, however, would be disrespectful and\ndemeaning, not the sort of attitude that love is. What robust concern\nviews seem to miss, Ebels-Duggan suggests, is the way love involves\ninteracting agents, each with a capacity for autonomy the recognition\nand engagement with which is an essential part of love. In response,\nadvocates of the robust concern view might point out that promoting\nsomeone\u2019s well-being normally requires promoting her autonomy\n(though they may maintain that this need not always be true: that\npaternalism towards a beloved can sometimes be justified and\nappropriate as an expression of one\u2019s love). Moreover, we might\nplausibly think, it is only through the exercise of one\u2019s\nautonomy that one can define one\u2019s own well-being as a person,\nso that a lover\u2019s failure to respect the beloved\u2019s\nautonomy would be a failure to promote her well-being and therefore\nnot an expression of love, contrary to what Ebels-Duggan suggests.\nConsequently, it might seem, robust concern views can counter this\nobjection by offering an enriched conception of what it is to be a\nperson and so of the well-being of persons.\n\nAnother source of worry is that the robust concern view offers too\nthin a conception of love. By emphasizing robust concern, this view\nunderstands other features we think characteristic of love, such as\none\u2019s emotional responsiveness to one\u2019s beloved, to be the\neffects of that concern rather than constituents of it. Thus\nVelleman (1999) argues that robust concern views, by understanding\nlove merely as a matter of aiming at a particular end (viz., the\nwelfare of one\u2019s beloved), understand love to be merely\nconative. However, he claims, love can have nothing to do with\ndesires, offering as a counterexample the possibility of loving a\ntroublemaking relation whom you do not want to be with, whose well\nbeing you do not want to promote, etc. Similarly, Badhwar (2003)\nargues that such a \u201cteleological\u201d view of love makes it\nmysterious how \u201cwe can continue to love someone long after death\nhas taken him beyond harm or benefit\u201d (p. 46). Moreover Badhwar\nargues, if love is essentially a desire, then it implies that we lack\nsomething; yet love does not imply this and, indeed, can be felt most\nstrongly at times when we feel our lives most complete and lacking in\nnothing. Consequently, Velleman and Badhwar conclude, love need not\ninvolve any desire or concern for the well-being of one\u2019s\nbeloved.\n\nThis conclusion, however, seems too hasty, for such examples can be\naccommodated within the robust concern view. Thus, the concern for\nyour relative in Velleman\u2019s example can be understood to be\npresent but swamped by other, more powerful desires to avoid him.\nIndeed, keeping the idea that you want to some degree to benefit him,\nan idea Velleman rejects, seems to be essential to understanding the\nconceptual tension between loving someone and not wanting to help him,\na tension Velleman does not fully acknowledge. Similarly, continued\nlove for someone who has died can be understood on the robust concern\nview as parasitic on the former love you had for him when he was still\nalive: your desires to benefit him get transformed, through your\nsubsequent understanding of the impossibility of doing so, into\n wishes.[7]\n Finally, the idea of concern for your beloved\u2019s well-being need\nnot imply the idea that you lack something, for such concern can be\nunderstood in terms of the disposition to be vigilant for occasions\nwhen you can come to his aid and consequently to have the relevant\noccurrent desires. All of this seems fully compatible with the robust\nconcern view.\n\nOne might also question whether Velleman and Badhwar make proper use\nof their examples of loving your meddlesome relation or someone who\nhas died. For although we can understand these as genuine cases of\nlove, they are nonetheless deficient cases and ought\ntherefore be understood as parasitic on the standard cases. Readily to\naccommodate such deficient cases of love into a philosophical analysis\nas being on a par with paradigm cases, and to do so without some\nspecial justification, is dubious.\n\nNonetheless, the robust concern view as it stands does not seem\nproperly able to account for the intuitive \u201cdepth\u201d of love\nand so does not seem properly to distinguish loving from liking.\nAlthough, as noted above, the robust concern view can begin to make\nsome sense of the way in which the lover\u2019s identity is altered\nby the beloved, it understands this only an effect of love,\nand not as a central part of what love consists in.\n\nThis vague thought is nicely developed by Wonderly (2017), who\nemphasizes that in addition to the sort of disinterested concern for\nanother that is central to robust-concern accounts of love, an\nessential part of at least romantic love is the idea that in loving\nsomeone I must find them to be not merely important for their own sake\nbut also important to me. Wonderly (2017) fleshes out what\nthis \u201cimportance to me\u201d involves in terms of the idea of\nattachment (developed in Wonderly 2016) that she argues can make sense\nof the intimacy and depth of love from within what remains\nfundamentally a robust-concern\n account.[8]\n",
