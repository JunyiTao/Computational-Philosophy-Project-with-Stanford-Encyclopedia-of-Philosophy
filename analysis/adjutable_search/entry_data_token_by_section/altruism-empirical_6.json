    "main_text": "The Egoism vs. Altruism Debate in Psychology || The Aversive-Arousal Reduction Hypothesis\n5.2 The Aversive-Arousal Reduction Hypothesis\n\nAnother popular egoistic strategy for explaining the link between\nempathy and helping behavior is the aversive-arousal reduction\nhypothesis, which maintains that witnessing someone in need, and\nthe empathy it evokes, is an unpleasant or aversive experience, and\nthat helping is motivated by the desire to diminish that aversive\n experience.[17]\n If this is right, Batson maintains, people in a high empathy\ncondition will sometimes have two quite different ways of reducing the\naversive experience\u2014they can help the person in need or they can\nsimply leave. Which strategy a person adopts will depend, in\npart, on how difficult or costly it is to depart the scene. If escape\nis easy, people will be more likely to take that option, while if\nleaving is more difficult people will be more likely to help, since\nthat is a less costly way of ending the aversive experience. If, on\nthe other hand, the empathy-altruism hypothesis is correct and empathy\nleads to genuinely altruistic motivation, one would expect people in a\nhigh empathy condition to help whether escape is easy or hard, since\nonly helping will satisfy an altruistic desire.\n\nAltruism and egoism both allow that even in the absence of empathy, an\nemotionally disturbing need situation will produce feelings of\npersonal distress, thus they would both predict that people\nin a low empathy condition will be more inclined to help when escape\nis difficult, and less inclined when escape is easy. Batson summarizes\nthese predictions in Tables 4 and 5 (Batson 1991: 111).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEscape\nEmpathy\n\nLow\nHigh \n\nEasy\nLow\nLow\n\nDifficult\nHigh\nHigh/Very High\n\n \n\n\u2190\nLevel of Empathy\n\n\u2190\nLevel of Helping\n\n\n\nTable 4.

Predictions from the\nEmpathy-Altruism Hypothesis for the Rate of Helping in an Escape X\nEmpathy Design\n\n\nTo test these predictions, Batson and his associates conducted a total\nof six experiments. In one of these (experiment 1 in Batson, Duncan,\net al. 1981), student subjects were required to watch, via what they\nbelieved to be closed circuit TV transmission\u2014actually a\nscripted video recording\u2014as another student subject,\nElaine\u2014actually a confederate\u2014attempted to perform a task\nwhile receiving electric shocks at random intervals. Observer subjects\nwere told that their task would be to form and report an impression of\nhow Elaine performs under aversive conditions. On the tape, Elaine is\nclearly finding the shocks very uncomfortable, and after her second\ntrial at doing the task, she explains to Martha, the assistant\nadministering the shocks, that she is unusually sensitive to mild\nelectric shocks because of a childhood trauma. Martha then suggests\nthat perhaps the observer subject might be willing to help Elaine by\ntaking her place, and the experimenter asks whether the subject is\nwilling to do that. To manipulate ease of escape, some subjects were\ntold that if they decide not to take Elaine\u2019s place, they will\nbe required to watch eight additional trials, while other subjects\nwere told that if they decide not to take Elaine\u2019s place they\nare free to go. To manipulate the level of empathy that subjects feel\nfor Elaine, subjects were given a copy of a personal values and\ninterests questionnaire, allegedly filled out by Elaine, in order to\nhelp them form an impression of her performance. In the high empathy\ncondition, Elaine\u2019s values and interests were very similar to\nthe subject\u2019s (which had been determined in a screening session\nseveral weeks before), while in the low empathy condition, they were\nvery different.\n\nThe results, given in Table 6, clearly exhibit the pattern predicted\nby the empathy-altruism hypothesis, not the pattern predicted by the\naversive-arousal reduction hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEscape\nEmpathy\n\nLow\nHigh \n\nEasy\n0.18\n0.91\n\nDifficult\n0.64\n0.82\n\n \n\n\u2190\nLevel of Empathy\n\n\u2190\nLevel of Helping\n\n\n\nTable 6. Proportion of Subjects Agreeing\nto Take Shocks for Elaine (Batson, Duncan, et al. 1981,\nExperiment\u00a01)\n\n\nIn additional experiments, Batson and his associates used four\ndifferent techniques to create the low- and high-empathy conditions,\ntwo techniques for manipulating ease of escape, and two different need\nsituations (Batson, Duncan, et al. 1981; Toi and Batson 1982; Batson,\nO\u2019Quin et al. 1983). The results in all of these experiments\nexhibited the same pattern. Intriguingly, in another experiment,\nBatson and colleagues attempted to break the pattern by telling the\nsubjects that the shock level they would have to endure was the\nhighest of four options, \u201cclearly painful but not\nharmful\u201d. They reasoned that, under these circumstances, even if\nhigh empathy subjects had an ultimate desire to help, this desire\nmight well be overridden by the desire to avoid a series of very\npainful shocks. As expected, the pattern of results in this experiment\nfit the pattern in\n Table 4.\n\nThese are impressive findings. Over and over again, in well designed\nand carefully conducted experiments, Batson and his associates have\nproduced results which are clearly compatible with the predictions of\nthe empathy-altruism hypothesis, as set out in\n Table 5,\n and clearly incompatible with the predictions of the aversive-arousal\nreduction hypothesis, as set out in\n Table 4.\n Even the \u201cclearly painful shock\u201d experiment, which\nproduced results in the pattern of Table 4, are comfortably compatible\nwith the empathy-altruism hypothesis; as noted earlier, the\nempathy-altruism hypothesis allows that high empathy subjects may have\ndesires that are stronger than their ultimate desire to help the\ntarget, and the desire to avoid a painful electric shock is a very\nplausible candidate.\n\nThere is, however, a problem to be overcome before one concludes that\nthe aversive-arousal reduction hypothesis cannot explain the findings\nthat Batson and his associates have reported. In arguing that\n Table 4\n reflects the predictions made by the aversive-arousal reduction\nhypothesis, Batson must assume that escape will alleviate the aversive\naffect in both low & high empathy situations, and that subjects\nbelieve this (although the belief may not be readily\navailable to introspection). One might call this the out of\nsight, out of mind assumption. Elaborating on an idea suggested\nby Hoffman (1991) and Hornstein (1991), an advocate of egoism might\npropose that although subjects do believe this when they have little\nempathy for the target, they do not believe it when they have high\nempathy for the target. Perhaps high empathy subjects believe\nthat if they escape they will continue to be troubled by the thought\nor memory of the distressed target and thus that physical escape will\nnot lead to psychological escape. Indeed, in cases where empathy is\nstrong and is evoked by attachment, this is just what common sense\nwould lead us to expect. Do you really believe that if your mother was\nin grave distress and you left without helping her you would not\ncontinue to be troubled by the knowledge that she was still in\ndistress? We\u2019re guessing that you don\u2019t. But if the\nhigh-empathy subjects in Batson\u2019s experiments believe that they\nwill continue to be plagued by distressing thoughts about the target\neven after they depart, then the egoistic aversive-arousal reduction\nhypothesis predicts that these subjects will be inclined to help in\nboth the easy physical escape and the difficult physical escape\nconditions, since helping is the only strategy they believe will be\neffective for reducing the aversive arousal. So neither the results\nreported in\n Table 6\n nor the results of any of Batson\u2019s other experiments would give\nus a reason to prefer the empathy-altruism hypothesis over the\naversive-arousal reduction hypothesis, because both hypotheses make\nthe same prediction.\n\nIs it the case that high empathy subjects in experiments like\nBatson\u2019s believe that unless they help they will continue to\nthink about the target and thus continue to feel distress, and that\nthis belief leads to helping because it generates an egoistic\ninstrumental desire to help? This is, of course, an empirical\nquestion, and a cleverly designed experiment by Stocks and his\nassociates (Stocks et al. 2009) suggests that, in situations like\nthose used in Batson\u2019s experiments, a belief that they will\ncontinue to think about the target does not play a\nsignificant role in causing the helping behavior in high empathy\nsubjects.\n\nBatson\u2019s work on the aversive-arousal reduction hypothesis,\nbuttressed by the Stocks et al. finding, is a major advance in the\negoism vs. altruism debate. The aversive-arousal reduction hypothesis\nhas been one of the most popular egoistic strategies for explaining\nhelping behavior. But the experimental findings strongly suggest that\nin situations like those that Batson and his associates have studied,\nthe empathy-altruism hypothesis offers a much better explanation of\nthe subjects\u2019 behavior than the aversive-arousal reduction\nhypothesis.\n\nAs noted earlier, Batson and his colleagues have also designed\nexperiments pitting the empathy-altruism hypothesis against a\nsubstantial list of other egoistic explanations for the link between\nempathy and helping behavior. In each case, the evidence appears to\nchallenge the egoistic alternative, though as is almost always the\ncase in empirical work of this sort, some researchers remain\n unconvinced.[18]\n There is however, an influential critique of Batson\u2019s work that\nchallenges all of his experimental work on the\nempathy-altruism hypothesis. It argues that empathy and its precursors\nalter people\u2019s self-concept in a way that undermines the claim\nthat their helping behavior is genuinely altruistic.\n",
