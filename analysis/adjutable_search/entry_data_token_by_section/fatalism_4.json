    "main_text": "Logical Fatalism: Aristotle\u2019s argument and the nature of truth || A-theories and B-theories of time\n1.4 A-theories and B-theories of time\n\nOn a B-theory of time an event\u2019s being past, present or future\nis simply a relational matter; it is simply a matter of its occurring\nat a time which is earlier than, or simultaneous with, or later than\nsome time which is taken as the reference point \u2013 the time at\nwhich I am having this thought, say. On an A-theory, on the other\nhand, that this time (or this event) is now is an absolute (if\ntemporary) fact about it. But, in addition, a B-theory will typically\nhold that all times are equally real, whereas, typically, an\nA-theory will hold either that only the present and the past are real\n(type 1), or that only the present is real (type 2). So, on a\nB-theory, there can be future facts to make propositions about the\nfuture true; but, on an A-theory of type 1, a proposition about the\nfuture can be made true only by present and past facts together with\ntimeless facts; and, on an A-theory of type 2, propositions both about\nthe future and about the past, can be made true only by present facts\ntogether with timeless facts. And, evidently, on either type of\nA-theory a proposition may be true at one time, but not true at\nanother, depending on what facts exist at the time. (For a fuller\ndescription of the A-theory and B-theory, see the Section 5 of the\nentry on\n time.)\n Suppose, then, that we hold a correspondence view of truth, and that\nwe espouse a version of the A-theory of time which says that there are\nno future facts. In that case we will naturally be attracted by the\nAristotelian solution. If, on the other hand, we espouse a version of\nthe B-theory which allows that there are future facts, we will\nnaturally reject this solution.\n\n",
