    "main_text": "Regress Objections to LOTH || Understanding a Language\n6.2 Understanding a Language\n\nWhat is it to understand a natural language word? On a popular\npicture, understanding a word requires that you mentally represent the\nword\u2019s denotation. For example, understanding the word\n\u201ccat\u201d requires representing that it denotes cats. LOT\ntheorists will say that you use Mentalese words to represent\ndenotations. The question now arises what it is to understand a\nMentalese word. If understanding the Mentalese word requires\nrepresenting that it has a certain denotation, then we face an\ninfinite regress of meta-languages (Blackburn 1984: 43\u201344).\n\nThe standard response is to deny that ordinary thinkers represent\nMentalese words as having denotations (Bach 1987; Fodor 1975:\n66\u201379). Mentalese is not an instrument of communication.\nThinking is not \u201ctalking to oneself\u201d in Mentalese. A\ntypical thinker does not represent, perceive, interpret, or reflect\nupon Mentalese expressions. Mentalese serves as a medium within which\nher thought occurs, not an object of interpretation. We should not say\nthat she \u201cunderstands\u201d Mentalese in the same way that she\nunderstands a natural language.\n\nThere is perhaps another sense in which the thinker\n\u201cunderstands\u201d Mentalese: her mental activity coheres with\nthe meanings of Mentalese words. For example, her deductive reasoning\ncoheres with the truth-tables expressed by Mentalese logical\nconnectives. More generally, her mental activity is semantically\ncoherent. To say that the thinker \u201cunderstands\u201d Mentalese\nin this sense is not to say that she represents Mentalese\ndenotations. Nor is there any evident reason to suspect that\nexplaining semantic coherence will ultimately require us to posit\nmental representation of Mentalese denotations. So there is no regress\nof understanding.\n\nFor further criticism of this regress argument, see the discussions of\nKnowles (1998) and Laurence and Margolis\n (1997).[8]\n",
