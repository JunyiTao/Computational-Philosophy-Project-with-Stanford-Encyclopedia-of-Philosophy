    "main_text": "Study of Specific Constitutions\n5. Aristotle and Modern Politics\n\nAristotle has continued to influence thinkers up to the present\nthroughout the political spectrum, including conservatives (such as\nHannah Arendt, Leo Strauss, and Eric Voegelin), communitarians (such\nas Alasdair MacIntyre and Michael Sandel), liberals (such as William\nGalston and Martha C. Nussbaum), libertarians (such as Tibor R.\nMachan, Douglas B. Rasmussen, and Douglas J. Den Uyl), and democratic\ntheorists (such as Jill Frank and Gerald M. Mara).\n\nIt is not surprising that such diverse political persuasions can lay\nclaim to Aristotle as a source. For his method often leads to\ndivergent interpretations. When he deals with a difficult problem, he\nis inclined to consider opposing arguments in a careful and nuanced\nmanner, and he is often willing to concede that there is truth on each\nside. For example, though he is critical of democracy, in one passage\nhe allows that the case for rule by the many based on the superior\nwisdom of the multitude \u201cperhaps also involves some truth\u201d\n(Pol. III.11.1281a39\u201342). Again, he sometimes applies his own\nprinciples in a questionable manner, for example, when he reasons that\nbecause associations should be governed in a rational manner, the\nhousehold should be run by the husband rather than by the wife, whose\nrational capacity \u201clacks authority\u201d (I.13.1260a13). Modern\ncommentators sympathetic with Aristotle\u2019s general approach often\ncontend that in this case he applies his own principles\nincorrectly\u2013leaving open the question of how they\nshould be applied. Further, the way he applies his principles\nmay have seemed reasonable in his socio-political context\u2013for\nexample, that the citizen of a polity (normally the best attainable\nconstitution) must be a hoplite soldier (cf. III.7,1297b4)\u2013but\nit may be debatable how these might apply within a modern democratic\nnation-state.\n\nThe problem of extrapolating to modern political affairs can be\nillustrated more fully in connection with Aristotle\u2019s discussion of\nlegal change in Politics II.8. He first lays out the argument\nfor making the laws changeable. It has been beneficial in the case of\nmedicine, for example, for it to progress from traditional ways to\nimproved forms of treatment. An existing law may be a vestige of a\nprimitive barbaric practice. For instance, Aristotle mentions a law in\nCyme that allows an accuser to produce a number of his own relatives\nas witnesses to prove that a defendant is guilty of murder.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Aristotle concludes, \u201cit is evident from the\nforegoing that some laws should sometimes be changed. But to those who\nlook at the matter from a different angle, caution would seem to be\nrequired\u201d (1269a12\u201314). Since the law gets its force from the\ncitizens\u2019 habit of obedience, great care should be exercised in making\nany change in it. It may sometimes be better to leave defective laws\nin place rather than encouraging lawlessness by changing the laws too\nfrequently. Moreover, there are the problems of how the laws are to be\nchanged and who is to change them. Although Aristotle offers valuable\ninsights, he breaks off the discussion of this topic and never takes\nit up elsewhere. We might sum up his view as follows: When it comes to\nchanging the laws, observe the mean: don\u2019t be too bound by traditional\nlaws, but on the other hand don\u2019t be overeager in altering them. It is\nobvious that this precept, reasonable as it is, leaves considerable\nroom for disagreement among contemporary\n\u201cneo-Aristotelian\u201d theorists. For example, should the laws\nbe changed to allow self-described transsexual persons to use sexually\nsegregated restrooms? Conservatives and liberals might agree with\nAristotle\u2019s general stricture regarding legal change but differ widely\non how to apply it in a particular case.\n\nMost scholars of Aristotle advisedly make no attempt to show that he\nis aligned with any contemporary ideology. Rather, insofar as they\nfind him relevant to our times, it is because he offers a remarkable\nsynthesis of idealism and pragmatism unfolding in deep and\nthought-provoking discussions of perennial concerns of political\nphilosophy: the role of human nature in politics, the relation of the\nindividual to the state, the place of morality in politics, the theory\nof political justice, the rule of law, the analysis and evaluation of\nconstitutions, the relevance of ideals to practical politics, the\ncauses and cures of political change and revolution, and the\nimportance of a morally educated citizenry.\nGlossary of Aristotelian Terms\n\naction: praxis\ncitizen: polit\u00eas\ncity-state: polis (also \u2018city\u2019 or\n\u2018state\u2019)\ncommunity: koin\u00f4nia\nconstitution: politeia (also \u2018regime\u2019)\nfaction: stasis (also \u2018civil war\u2019)\nfree: eleutheros\nfriendship: philia\ngood: agathos\nhappiness: eudaimonia\nhappy: eudaim\u00f4n\njustice: dikaiosun\u00ea\nlaw: nomos\nlawgiver: nomothet\u00eas\nmaster: despot\u00eas\nnature: phusis\nnoble: kalon (also \u2018beautiful\u2019 or\n\u2018fine\u2019)\npeople (d\u00eamos)\npolitical: politikos (of, or pertaining to, the\npolis)\npolitical science: politik\u00ea\nepist\u00eam\u00ea\npolitician: politikos (also \u2018statesman\u2019)\npractical: praktikos\npractical wisdom: phron\u00easis\nrevolution: metabol\u00ea (also\n\u2018change\u2019)\nright: exousia (also \u2018liberty\u2019)\nruler: arch\u00f4n\nself-sufficient: autark\u00eas\nsovereign: kurios\nvirtue: aret\u00ea (also \u2018excellence\u2019)\nwithout qualification: hapl\u00f4s (also\n\u2018absolute\u2019)\nwithout authority: akuron\n\n",
