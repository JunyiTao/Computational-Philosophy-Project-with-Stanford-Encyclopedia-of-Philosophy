    "main_text": "Absolutist Ethics and Necessitarian Theology\n5. Absolutist Ethics and Necessitarian Theology\n\nSince the Restoration More had concentrated exclusively on religious\nwritings, some of which were demanded by the writings of his critics.\nIn 1667, however, he produced a work on moral philosophy, the\nEnchiridion ethicum. It is known that More wrote Latin with\ndifficulty, and it is not clear why he did not publish this in\nEnglish. It is possible that he hoped to reach a wider, European\naudience\u2014certainly this would be the motivation, a few years\nlater, for translating his earlier works into a Latin Opera\nomnia (1675\u201379)\u2014but this seems an unlikely book with\nwhich to introduce oneself to a European readership. There is another\npossible explanation, with much more restricted local concerns: More\npublished it in Latin to leave room for his friend and colleague Ralph\nCudworth to publish his very similar system of ethics in English.\n\nThe fact is, as with so many other aspects of their thinking, More and\nCudworth shared essentially the same moral philosophy. Cudworth had\nbeen preparing his own book on ethics for a number of years but in the\nevent he never published anything in this area. It seems that he\nabandoned the project when he heard that More was also working on a\nbook on ethics. Cudworth\u2019s system was posthumously published\nunder the title, A Treatise Concerning Eternal and Immutable\nMorality (1731), but it is a title that More might also have\nused. One of the main aims of More\u2019s Manual of Ethics\nwas to leave the reader in no doubt that there are absolute values of\ngood and evil which are co-eternal with God. That is to say, More\nwished to refute the Calvinist theological position that whatever God\ndecrees to be good is good, in favour of the alternative theological\nposition, that God wills what is good (and he does so necessarily\nbecause He himself conforms to an absolute standard of goodness).\n\nThis marks a new phase in More\u2019s life-long opposition to\nCalvinism. The theology of Calvinism is known as voluntaristic\ntheology because it emphasises God\u2019s will in the Creation. God\ncould, and did, create the world freely by the power of his omnipotent\nwill. His choices in the Creation could not be held to have been\nconstrained by pre-existing notions of good or evil, or by\npre-existing essences or natures of things, because there were no such\npre-existing notions before the Creation. The opposing view,\nrepresented by More, is known as necessitarian, or intellectualist, or\neven rationalist theology, and is most familiar to modern readers\nthrough the satirical representation of it in Voltaire\u2019s\nCandide (1759). In this theology, God cannot create a world\narbitrarily, with no constraints upon his creativity. God has to\nconform to pre-existing, co-eternal, moral and conceptual principles.\nGod must conform to principles of goodness and justice. Similarly, he\nmust create matter that embodies the principles of materiality,\nnamely, inertness and passivity. Because God is supremely good he must\ncreate the best of all possible worlds. The clear implication of this\nis that what makes a good world, or a better one, and what makes the\nbest one possible, can be specified independently of God. More\nbelieved the concepts of good and evil were absolute terms, presumably\nco-eternal with God, and must necessarily guide, and indeed restrain,\nGod\u2019s creative omnipotence (Henry 1990, Taliaferro 2005).\n\nMore\u2019s necessitarian theology is very much to the fore in the\nDivine Dialogues of 1668. Although this is intended to\npresent the main features of his philosophical theology to a much\nwider audience, it is presented, as the extended title makes plain, in\nthe context of a discussion about the nature of God\u2019s\nProvidence. At one point More tells us that \u201call the Orders of\nthe Creation in the whole Universe\u201d issue from God\u2019s\n\u201cinfinite Goodness, Wisdome and Power\u201d, and that His\ngoodness is\n\nSo perfect, immutable and permanent, as never\u2026 to be carried\notherwise than to what is the best, and his wisdome never at a loss to\ndiscern, nor his power to execute it\u2026\n\n\nIt is repugnant to reason, More insists, that God \u201cshould ever\nwill any thing but what is absolutely for the best\u201d (More 1668,\nII, 24\u201325). More even discusses in this connection the existence\nof animals which do not seem to be beneficial to mankind; arguing that\nthey must serve some purpose in the whole system of this best of all\npossible worlds (Muratori 2017).\n\nMore\u2019s new theological emphasis is also evident in the rather\ndifferent attempt to reach a wider audience, this time a learned\nLatinate audience across Europe, which he published in 1671, his\nEnchiridion metaphysicum. The Manual of Metaphysics\nis a major re-statement of More\u2019s views on incorporeal\nsubstance, or spirit. The main claims are familiar from his earlier\nphilosophical works, therefore, but there are two new, and highly\nsignificant, features. Firstly, More fully develops his ideas on\nabsolute infinite space and presents it as a major exemplar of\nincorporeal spirit (Koyr\u00e9 1957, Reid 2007, 2012). Secondly,\nwhile drawing on contemporary experimental natural philosophy to\nprovide him with examples of phenomena which cannot be explained\nsolely in terms of matter and motion, More explicitly draws upon a\nspecific experiment performed by Robert Boyle, and published by him in\nhis New Experiments Physico-mechanicall touching the Spring of the\nAir (1660). If Boyle knew of More\u2019s Immortality of the\nSoul (and it is almost certain that he did), he never troubled to\ncomment publicly upon it. Once his own experiments, and his own name,\nwere deliberately invoked to support More\u2019s philosophical\ntheology, however, Boyle could not let it pass (Henry 1990).\n",
