Some hold that it does not bear scrutiny. Moreover,\nthose who accept the distinction hold competing views on its\nsignificance as well as on the relation between substantive and\nstructural rationality.\n\nFirst, there are those who identify rationality simpliciter\nwith structural rationality (Scanlon 1998; Broome 2013, 2020; Ridge\n2014: ch. 8). Such philosophers deny that what others call\n\u2018substantive rationality\u2019 is genuinely a kind of\nrationality at all: they hold that the requirements of structural\nrationality exhaust the requirements of rationality\nsimpliciter. It is debatable to what extent this dispute is\nmerely terminological or substantive. These philosophers don\u2019t\ndeny that there is an important normative notion \u2013 viz.\n\u2018ought\u2019 or \u2018most reason\u2019 \u2013 that can be\nunderstood in terms of what one\u2019s reasons, on balance, support.\nBut they want to withhold the label \u2018rationality\u2019 from\nit.\n\nOne argument for withholding the label \u2018rationality\u2019 from\n(what we\u2019ve called) substantive rationality proceeds from the\npurported conceptual constraint that rationality supervenes on the\nmind: there can be no change in whether an agent counts as rational\nwithout a change in her mental states (Wedgwood 2002; Broome 2013,\n2020). It then holds that reasons do not supervene on the mind:\none\u2019s reasons can change without one\u2019s mental states\nchanging. Thus, it is concluded, rationality cannot require us to\ncorrectly respond to our reasons. The argument can be supported by\nintuitions about cases. In a famous case (Broome 2007a), Lois has a\npiece of fish in front of her, which unbeknownst to her, contains\nsalmonella. The fact that the fish contains salmonella is a decisive\nreason for Lois not to eat it; yet, since Lois is unaware of this\nreason, she cannot be irrational for failing to respond to it.\nArguably, it is precisely because rationality supervenes on the mind\nthat Lois cannot be irrational for failing to respond to a reason that\nshe is entirely unaware of.\n\nDefenders of the notion of substantive rationality reply that the\nnotion of \u2018reasons\u2019 at work in the conception of\nrationality as reasons-responsiveness is in some important way\nconstrained by the agent\u2019s epistemic position (Kiesewetter 2017;\nLord 2018). Perhaps, for example, substantive rationality requires us\nto respond only to the reasons that our evidence makes available to us\n\u2013 often called \u201cavailable\u201d or\n\u201cpossessed\u201d reasons. If this is so, then eating the fish\nmay well be substantively rational for Lois. Moreover, while\nunpossessed reasons do not supervene on the mind, it is less clear\nthat the same is true for possessed reasons. Thus, the rational\nrequirement to correctly respond to these reasons may be compatible\nwith the supervenience of rationality on the mind (Kiesewetter\n2020).\n\nIt is also worth noting that the proposal that rationality\nsimpliciter is just structural rationality is much less\npopular in epistemology than it is in ethics and the practical\nrationality literature (Worsnip 2016b). In epistemology, it is\northodoxy that agents who fail to respond to their evidential reasons\nfor belief thereby fail to be\n rational,[3]\n and thus that there are rational requirements of\nreasons-responsiveness \u2013 i.e. requirements of substantive\nrationality. By contrast, purely coherentist theories of epistemic\nrationality \u2013 which effectively identify epistemic rationality\nwith a kind of structural rationality \u2013 are now widely\nrejected.\n\nA second view about the relationship between structural and\nsubstantive rationality contends that these two notions of rationality\nultimately come to the same thing (Wedgwood 2017; Smithies,\nforthcoming). This position can be motivated in part by taking on\nboard the aforementioned point that substantive rationality requires\nus only to respond to those reasons that our evidence makes available\nto us. Putting this together with the claim that our evidence consists\nin or at least supervenes on our mental states, it can be argued that\nthe rational requirement to respond to our evidentially available\nreasons is itself a requirement to ensure a kind of coherence between\nour mental states, in a broad sense of \u2018coherence\u2019. Thus,\nit is argued, the distinction between substantive rationality (viz.\nreasons-responsiveness) and structural rationality (viz. coherence)\nbreaks down.\n\nDefenders of the structural-substantive distinction respond that the\nnotion of (in)coherence that we should employ in order to understand\nstructural rationality is narrower than the one needed to break the\ndistinction down (Fogal and Worsnip 2021). Consider someone who has a\nbelief that is insufficiently supported by her (available) evidence:\nsay, she believes that the Orioles will win today\u2019s baseball\ngame, when her (available) evidence doesn\u2019t, in fact, give her\nsufficient grounds for thinking this. Suppose, however, that she holds\nher belief not in knowing defiance of her evidence, but rather because\nshe simply mistakenly overestimates the probative strength of her\nevidence. In this case, she has a belief that is insufficiently\nsupported by her (available) evidential reasons, and thus fails to be\nsubstantively rational. Yet it is only in a very broad sense of\n\u2018incoherent\u2019 that she is incoherent. In a narrower sense\nof \u2018incoherent\u2019, she need not be incoherent: as long as\nshe does not recognize what her (available) reasons support believing,\nthere seems to be no internal clash between her attitudes here. This\nnarrow sense of \u2018incoherent\u2019 \u2013 it is held \u2013 is\nthe one relevant for structural rationality. This position can be\nbolstered by appeal to the central characteristics of structural\nrationality identified in \u00a71.2 above. The judgment that there is\na rational shortcoming involved in believing that the Orioles will win\ntoday depends on substantive judgments about reasons, and the\ncircumstances and evidence of the agent. Moreover, this rational\nshortcoming isn\u2019t an instance of a more general pattern of\nirrationality that can be identified in abstraction from the content\nof the attitude involved. Additionally, the narrower sense of\n(in)coherence relevant for structural (ir)rationality is held to\nobtain only between what Scanlon (1998, 18ff.) has called\n\u201cjudgment-sensitive attitudes\u201d, such as beliefs and\nintentions, and cannot involve other mental states such as\nperceptions, which are not responsive to judgment or reasoning. Thus,\nto have beliefs that are out of whack with one\u2019s perceptual\nevidence will not be incoherent in this narrower sense, nor\nstructurally irrational.\n\nA third set of views holds that, though substantive and structural\nrationality can be intelligibly distinguished, one is reducible to the\nother. Some hold that structural rationality can be reduced to\nsubstantive rationality (Kiesewetter 2017; Lord 2018; Henning 2018;\nLasonen-Aarnio 2021; see also Singh forthcoming). One way of effecting\nthis reduction is via the claim that what it is to be structurally\nirrational is to have a combination of attitudinal mental states such\nthat it is guaranteed that, whatever one\u2019s situation\n(and thus, one\u2019s reasons) is like, at least one of the mental\nstates fails to be substantively rational (Kiesewetter 2017:\n235\u201339; see also Kolodny 2007a and 2008 and Lord 2018 for\nrelated ideas). For example, it seems plausible that whatever\none\u2019s situation (and thus, one\u2019s reasons) is like,\none\u2019s evidence can never sufficiently support both believing\n\\(p\\) and believing not-\\(p\\). If this is so, then to believe \\(p\\)\nand believe not-\\(p\\) is to have a combination of attitudinal mental\nstates such that it is guaranteed that, whatever one\u2019s situation\nis like, at least one of these mental states fails to be substantively\nrational. Similarly, it might be thought, one\u2019s reasons could\nnever support intending an end and believing that a means is\nnecessary for that end, while also supporting not intending\nthe means; and this is what makes the combination structurally\nirrational. Notice that this view is not one on which structural and\nsubstantive irrationality turn out to be the same property: having\nattitudes that guarantee a failure to respond correctly to one\u2019s\nreasons (structural irrationality) is a stronger property than merely\nhaving failed to respond correctly to one\u2019s reasons (a failure\nof substantive rationality). It thus accommodates the natural idea\nthat structural rationality involves a distinct kind of failure.\n\nCritics of this view push back in a number of ways, but perhaps the\nmost common response is to point to cases where jointly incoherent\nattitudes are individually permitted by one\u2019s reasons (Broome\n2013: 85\u20136; Way 2013). For example, suppose that your evidence\nindicates that to go to the supermarket, you must get on your bike\n(thus permitting, or perhaps even requiring, belief in this\nproposition). And suppose that your reasons permit, but don\u2019t\nrequire, you to go to the supermarket. In that case, it seems like\nyour reasons permit, but don\u2019t require, you to get on your bike.\nIn that case, neither the intention to go to the supermarket, nor the\nbelief that to do so you must get on your bike, nor the absence of an\nintention to get on your bike, fails to be substantively rational. Yet\nit seems that the three are still structurally irrational in\ncombination. If this is right, then the structural irrationality of\nsome combination of attitudes is not a guarantee that at least one of\nthe attitudes fails to be substantively rational. Similarly, perhaps\nthere are permissive cases with respect to one\u2019s doxastic\nattitudes (Ballantyne and Coffman 2011; Schoenfield 2014). For\nexample, perhaps your evidence can permit a credence of 0.6 for \\(p\\),\nbut also permit a credence of 0.61 for \\(p\\). Correspondingly, then,\nit permits a credence of either 0.39 or 0.4 for not-\\(p\\). In that\ncase, neither a credence of 0.61 for \\(p\\) nor a credence of 0.4 for\nnot-\\(p\\) fails to be substantively rational. Yet the combination of\nthe two is structurally irrational (Staffel 2020).\n\nVarious strategies have been proposed to deal with this challenge.\nKolodny (2011) and Lord (2018: Ch.2) both suggest that the adoption of\nan intention can alter one\u2019s reasons to take the means,\nrendering a means-intention that was merely permitted prior to the\nadoption of the end-intention, substantively required (an analogous\nstory about credences is suggested in Lord 2020). Drawing on work by\nBratman (1987), Kiesewetter (2017: Ch. 10) argues that in cases of\nmerely permissible ends, means-end incoherent agents will flout\neconomical reasons because maintaining intentions that one\nwill not carry out makes one susceptible to waste resources. With\nrespect to doxastic incoherence, it is also an option to reject the\nkind of permissivism that is in conflict with explaining structural\nirrationality in terms of substantive requirements of rationality\n(e.g., White 2005, Schultheis 2018). On one alternative view,\nsubstantive epistemic rationality permits us to have imprecise\ncredences rather than several precise credences that are\nprobabilistically incoherent.\n\nOther philosophers can be understood as pursuing a reduction in the\nopposite direction: that is, a reduction of substantive rationality to\nstructural rationality. For example, some hold that what it is to have\na reason to \\(\\Phi\\) is to be such that, were one\u2019s\nmental states to be corrected for structural irrationality, one would\nbe motivated to \\(\\Phi\\) \u2013 or desire to \\(\\Phi\\), or intend to\n\\(\\Phi\\), or similar (Smith 1994; Markovits 2014). Such accounts of\nreasons are often called \u201cidealized attitudes\u201d accounts.\nIf reasons can be reduced to facts about structural rationality, this\nplausibly provides the materials to reduce substantive rationality\n(itself understood in terms of reasons-responsiveness) to facts about\nstructural rationality too. However, idealized attitudes accounts of\nreasons have been subjected to numerous objections (see e.g. Enoch\n2005). One important objection in the present context is that it is\nquite unclear how to generalize this view to reasons for (and thus,\nthe substantive irrationality of) belief (Cuneo 2007: ch. 7). Another\nis that, since there is typically more than one way to correct for\nstructural irrationality, such views will leave it radically\nindeterminate what our reasons are, or perhaps generate reasons for\nalmost anything (Sampson 2021).\n\nFourth, and finally, some philosophers hold that substantive and\nstructural rationality are both equally genuine kinds of rationality\nand that neither is reducible to the other (Worsnip 2021). Such views\nowe us an account of how, if at all, these two kinds of rationality\nrelate to one another: for example, can they come into conflict with\none another? If substantive rationality often recommends one thing and\nstructural rationality recommends another, this may seem\ndissatisfying, especially if there is nothing to be said about which\ndemand takes rational precedence. Indeed, some may think the prospect\nof structural and substantive rationality conflicting shows that they\ncan\u2019t both be bona fide sources of rational requirements.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that the extent of any conflicts\nbetween structural and substantive rationality depends on the positive\ntheory of structural rationality that we adopt. On a\n\u201cwide-scope\u201d view about structural rationality (see\n\u00a72.1 below), its requirements are merely negative, prohibiting\nincoherent combinations of attitudes, and one can come to satisfy the\nrelevant requirement by revising any of the incoherent\nattitudes. If this is so, it reduces the potential for conflicts\nbetween substantive and structural rationality. This is because, on\nthis view, structural rationality simply tells one that one should\nrestore coherence in some way when one is incoherent, and\nthis leaves room for substantive rationality to (sometimes) determine,\nmore specifically, which way to do so. For example, consider\nagain Ali, who believes that he is Superman and that Superman can fly.\nIf Ali\u2019s evidence is normal, substantive rationality prohibits\nAli from believing he can fly. Does structural rationality require him\nto believe he can fly? Not obviously: it might permit him instead to\nrevise one of his original beliefs, requiring only that he\neither believe he can fly or revise one of these\noriginal beliefs. Some have argued, however, that conflicts between\nsubstantive and structural rationality can arise in subtler ways in\nspecial cases (Worsnip 2018a).\n",
