    "main_text": "Definition and Outline\n1. Definition and Outline\n\nColonialism is not a modern phenomenon. World history is full of\nexamples of one society gradually expanding by incorporating adjacent\nterritory and settling its people on newly conquered territory. In the\nsixteenth century, colonialism changed decisively because of\ntechnological developments in navigation that began to connect more\nremote parts of the world. The modern European colonial project\nemerged when it became possible to move large numbers of people across\nthe ocean and to maintain political control in spite of geographical\ndispersion. This entry uses the term colonialism to describe the\nprocess of European settlement, violent dispossession and political\ndomination over the rest of the world, including the Americas,\nAustralia, and parts of Africa and Asia.\n\nThe difficulty of defining colonialism stems from the fact that the\nterm is often used as a synonym for imperialism. Both colonialism and\nimperialism were forms of conquest that were expected to benefit\nEurope economically and strategically. The term colonialism is\nfrequently used to describe the settlement of North America,\nAustralia, New Zealand, Algeria, and Brazil, places that were\ncontrolled by a large population of permanent European residents. The\nterm imperialism often describes cases in which a foreign government\nadministers a territory without significant settlement; typical\nexamples include the scramble for Africa in the late nineteenth\ncentury and the American domination of the Philippines and Puerto\nRico. The distinction between the two, however, is not entirely\nconsistent in the literature. Some scholars distinguish between\ncolonies for settlement and colonies for economic exploitation. Others\nuse the term colonialism to describe dependencies that are directly\ngoverned by a foreign nation and contrast this with imperialism, which\ninvolves indirect forms of domination. Like colonialism, imperialism\nalso involves political and economic control over a dependent\nterritory. The etymology of the two terms, however, provides some\nclues about how they differ. The term colony comes from the Latin word\ncolonus, meaning farmer. This root reminds us that the\npractice of colonialism usually involved the transfer of population to\na new territory, where the arrivals lived as permanent settlers while\nmaintaining political allegiance to their country of origin.\nImperialism, on the other hand, comes from the Latin term\nimperium, meaning to command. Thus, the term imperialism\ndraws attention to the way that one country exercises power over\nanother, whether through settlement, sovereignty, or indirect\nmechanisms of control.\n\nThe confusion about the meaning of the term imperialism reflects the\nway that the concept has changed over time. Although the English word\nimperialism was not commonly used before the nineteenth century,\nElizabethans already described the United Kingdom as \u201cthe\nBritish Empire.\u201d As Britain began to acquire overseas\ndependencies, the concept of empire was employed more frequently.\nImperialism was understood as a system of military domination and\nsovereignty over territories. The day to day work of government might\nbe exercised indirectly through local assemblies or indigenous rulers\nwho paid tribute, but sovereignty rested with the British. The shift\naway from this traditional understanding of empire was influenced by\nthe Leninist analysis of imperialism as a system oriented towards\neconomic exploitation. According to Lenin, imperialism was the\nnecessary and inevitable result of the logic of accumulation in late\ncapitalism. Thus, for Lenin and subsequent Marxists, imperialism\ndescribed a historical stage of capitalism rather than a\ntrans-historical practice of political and military domination. The\nlasting impact of the Marxist approach is apparent in contemporary\ndebates about American imperialism, a term which usually means\nAmerican economic hegemony, regardless of whether such power is\nexercised directly or indirectly (Young 2001).\n\nGiven the difficulty of consistently distinguishing between the two\nterms, this entry will use colonialism as a broad concept that refers\nto the project of European political domination that began in the\nearly sixteenth century. While the national liberation movements of\nthe post-World War II era brought formal colonization to an end in\nmany parts of the world, Indigenous peoples still live in\nsettler-colonial states, and there are on-going struggles to reclaim\ncontrol of traditional territories. Post-colonialism will be used to\ndescribe the political and theoretical struggles of societies that\nexperienced the transition from political dependence to sovereignty.\nThis entry will use imperialism as a broad term that refers to\neconomic, military, political domination that is achieved without\nsignificant permanent European settlement.\n",
