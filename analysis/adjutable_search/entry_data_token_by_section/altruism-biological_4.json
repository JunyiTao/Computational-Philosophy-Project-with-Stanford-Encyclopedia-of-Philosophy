This was the definition\nused by Hamilton (1964), and by many subsequent authors. However,\nthere is less consensus on how to describe behaviours that boost the\nfitness of others but also boost the fitness of the organism\nperforming the behaviour. As West et al. (2007) note, such\nbehaviours are sometimes termed \u2018co-operative\u2019, but this\nusage is not universal; others use \u2018co-operation\u2019 to refer\nto behaviour that boosts the fitness of others irrespective of its\neffect on self; while still others use \u2018cooperation\u2019 as a\nsynonym for altruism. (Indeed, in the simple Prisoner's dilemma game\nabove, the two strategies are usually called \u2018co-operate\u2019\nand \u2018defect\u2019.) To avoid this confusion, West et\nal. (2007) suggest the term \u2018mutual benefit\u2019 for\nbehaviours that benefit both self and other, while Sachs et\nal. (2004) suggest \u2018byproduct benefit\u2019.\n\n\nWhatever term is used, the important point is that behaviours that\nbenefit both self and others can evolve much more easily than\naltruistic behaviours, and thus require no special mechanisms such as\nkinship. The reason is clear: organisms performing such behaviours\nthereby increase their personal fitness, so are at a selective\nadvantage vis-a-vis those not performing the behaviour. The fact that\nthe behaviour has a beneficial effect on the fitness of others is a\nmere side-effect, or byproduct, and is not part of the explanation for\nwhy the behaviour evolves. For example, Sachs et al. (2004)\nnote that an action such as joining a herd or a flock may be of this\nsort; the individual gains directly, via his reduced risk of\npredation, while simultaneously reducing the predation risk of other\nindividuals. By contrast with an altruistic action, there is no\npersonal incentive to \u2018cheat\u2019, i.e., to refrain from\nperforming the action, for doing so would directly reduce personal\nfitness.\n\nAlso indicative of the difference between altruistic behaviour and\nbehaviour that benefit both self and others is the fact that in the\nlatter case, though not the former, the beneficiary may be a member of\na different species, without altering the evolutionary dynamics of the\nbehaviour. Indeed, there are numerous examples where the\nself-interested activities of one organism produce an incidental\nbenefit for a non-conspecific; such behaviours are sometimes called\n\u2018mutualistic\u2019, though again, this is not the only way that\nthe latter term has been used (West et al. 2007). By\ncontrast, in the case of altruism, it makes an enormous difference\nwhether the beneficiary and the donor are con-specifics or not; for\nif not, then kin selection can play no role, and it is quite unclear how\nthe altruistic behaviour can evolve. Unsurprisingly, virtually all the\nbona fide examples of biological altruism in the living world involve\ndonors and recipients that are con-specifics. (Cases of so-called\n\u2018reciprocal altruism\u2019 are sometimes thought to be\nexceptions to this generalization; but see section 4 below.)\n",
