    "main_text": "The Argument For Fictionalism || Premise (1) and Paraphrase Nominalism\n1.2 Premise (1) and Paraphrase Nominalism\n\nParaphrase nominalism is the view that ordinary mathematical sentences\nlike \u20183 is prime\u2019 should not be read at face\nvalue\u2014or more specifically, that they should not be read as\nbeing of the form \u2018Fa\u2019 and making claims\nabout mathematical objects. There are a few different versions of this\nview. Perhaps the most famous is if-thenism. On this view,\n\u20183 is prime\u2019 is best interpreted as expressing a\nconditional claim, such as \u2018If there were numbers, then 3 would\nbe prime\u2019, or perhaps \u2018Necessarily, if there are numbers,\nthen 3 is prime.\u2019 (Versions of if-thenism have been developed by\nPutnam (1967a,b), Horgan (1984), Hellman (1989), Dorr (2008), and\nYablo (2017); moreover, a precursor to this view was endorsed by the\nearly Hilbert (see his 1899 and his letters to Frege in Frege 1980).\nFinally, other versions of paraphrase nominalism have been endorsed by\nChihara (1990), Yi (2002), Hofweber (2005), Rayo (2008, 2013), and\nMoltmann (2013); and one might also interpret Curry (1951) and\nWittgenstein (1956) in this way.) \n\nThe problem with paraphrase nominalist views is very simple: they\ninvolve empirical hypotheses about the meanings of ordinary\nmathematical utterances that are extremely implausible. For instance,\nin connection with if-thenism, it\u2019s just really hard to believe\nthat the best interpretation of what ordinary speakers of mathematical\ndiscourse (ordinary mathematicians and ordinary folk) are saying when\nthey utter, e.g., \u20183 is prime\u2019 is that if there were\nnumbers then 3 would be prime. This just seems to get wrong what\npeople actually mean when they utter sentences like this. Indeed, it\nseems that a more general point can be made here. There is a good\ninterpretive principle that says something like this: we should\ninterpret people\u2019s utterances at face value unless there\u2019s\nevidence that they have positive intentions to be interpreted\nnonliterally. Given this, and given (what seems obvious) that ordinary\npeople don\u2019t have positive intentions for their mathematical\nutterances to be interpreted nonliterally\u2014e.g., as expressing\nconditional propositions\u2014it seems to follow that we ought to\ninterpret our mathematical utterances at face value. But this means\nthat we ought to accept premise (1) and reject paraphrase\nnominalism.\n\nParaphrase nominalists might try to respond to this argument by\ndenying that they are committed to the thesis that their paraphrases\nfit with the intentions of ordinary mathematicians and ordinary folk.\nIndeed, claims of this sort have been made by both Chihara (1990,\n2004) and Hellman (1998). But paraphrase nominalists cannot endorse\nthis stance, for if they do, their view will collapse into a version\nof fictionalism. If paraphrase nominalists admit that platonists and\nfictionalists are right about the meanings of real\nmathematical utterances\u2014i.e., the utterances of actual\nmathematicians\u2014then (since they also want to maintain that there\nare no such things as abstract objects) they will be committed to the\nclaim that the utterances of actual mathematicians are untrue. Thus,\nif paraphrase nominalists don\u2019t claim that their paraphrases\ncapture the actual meanings of ordinary mathematical sentences, then\ntheir view won\u2019t provide a genuine alternative to fictionalism.\nIt will collapse into a version of fictionalism. More specifically, a\nparaphrase nominalist would just be a fictionalist who thinks that we\nought to alter our mathematical language, or what we mean by\nour mathematical utterances; or perhaps the claim would simply be that\nwe could alter our mathematical language if we wanted to and\nthat this fact provides fictionalists with a way of responding to\ncertain objections.\n",
