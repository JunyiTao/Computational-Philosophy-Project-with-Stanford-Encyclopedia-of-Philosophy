    "main_text": "Special Topics in the Study of Animal Consciousness || Self-consciousness and metacognition\n8. Summary\nAn article such as this perhaps raises more questions than it\nanswers, but the topic would be of little philosophical interest if it\nwere otherwise. \n\nIt is clear that for many philosophers, the topic of animal\nconsciousness is no longer only of peripheral interest. There is\nincreasing interest in animal cognition from a range of philosophical\nperspectives, including ethics, philosophy of mind, and the philosophy\nof science. Philosophers working in all of these areas are\nincreasingly attentive to the particular details of scientific theory,\nmethods, and results. Many scientists and philosophers believe that\nthe groundwork has been laid for addressing at least some of the\nquestions about animal consciousness in a philosophically\nsophisticated yet empirically tractable way. Yet there remain critics\nfrom both sides: on the one hand are those who still think that\nsubjective phenomena are beyond the pale of scientific research, and\non the other are those who think that science and philosophy have not\nmoved far enough or fast enough to recognize animal consciousness.\nThe arguments on both sides are by no means exhausted.\n",
