    "main_text": "Ontological Commitment in Ordinary Language || The Method of Paraphrase, and its Problems\n4.2 The Method of Paraphrase, and its Problems\nIf criteria of ontological commitment cannot be applied directly to\nordinary language, then attributions of ontological commitment to\nphilosophers\u2014or ordinary folk, but we will focus on\nphilosophers\u2014cannot be made just by examining the statements or\ntheories that they accept. Those statements or theories may\nhave prima facie ontological commitments, to be sure, in\nvirtue of their quantificational or referential apparatus. But some\nmethod is needed to determine which prima facie commitments\ncount as genuine commitments. Enter here the method of\nparaphrase endorsed by Quine and his modern day\nfollowers. According to this method, we must first ask the philosopher\nto provide paraphrases of her statements into the regimented portion\nof our language, paraphrases that are acceptable by standards agreed\nto in advance. We then apply our criterion of ontological commitment\nto the regimented paraphrases. If the philosopher provides acceptable\nparaphrases that are not ontologically committed to Ks, then\nshe is acquitted of commitment to Ks. If the paraphrases she\nprovides are ontologically committed to Ks, then she is\nguilty of such commitment. If she opts out, refusing to provide\nparaphrases into the regimented portion of language, then attributions\nof ontological commitment are moot.\nThe method of paraphrase dominated ontological discussion\nthroughout much of the twentieth century. For a detailed illustration\nof the method from its heyday, one can do no better than to turn to\nDavid and Stephanie Lewis's article \u201cHoles\u201d (Lewis and\nLewis 1970), a dialogue between two philosophers, a nominalist and a\nrealist about abstract objects. Suppose that the nominalist accepts\nstatements that are prima facie committed to\n(immaterial) holes, such as \u201cthere are holes in this\npiece of cheese\u201d. To be acquitted of this prima facie\ncommitment, the nominalist seeks a paraphrase that avoids\nit\u2014not just for this one sentence, but for ordinary discourse\nabout holes generally. To be acceptable, the paraphrases should\npreserve the truth of those statements about holes, and the validity\nof those arguments about holes, that are endorsed by ordinary\nspeakers. As a first stab, she might make use of the predicate\n\u2018perforated\u2019 and paraphrase \u201cthere are holes in\nthis piece of cheese\u201d as \u201cthe cheese is\nperforated\u201d. This allows the nominalist to continue to\n\u201cspeak with the vulgar\u201d without taking on a commitment to\nholes. But the predicate \u2018perforated\u2019 won't help in\nproviding paraphrases for statements that count holes, such as\n\u201cthere are seventeen holes in this piece of cheese\u201d.\nHere the nominalist could introduce a separate predicate,\n\u2018n-perforated\u2019, for each n. That,\nhowever, would violate strictures against infinitely many primitive\npredicates in the regimented language; and it wouldn't be of much\nhelp in paraphrasing numerical comparisons such as \u201cthere are\nas many holes in this piece of cheese as there are crackers on this\nplate\u201d. In the case of discourse about holes, the nominalist\ndoes better to turn to a different strategy of paraphrase:\nontological reduction.[41] \nAn ontological reduction maintains the\nquantificational structure of the discourse, but restricts the\nunderlying domain to uncontroversial entities, in this case, material\nobjects. For example, \u201cthere are holes in this piece of\ncheese\u201d can be taken to quantify, not over immaterial holes,\nbut over material hole-linings; talk of holes is interpreted as talk\nof the hole-linings that, intuitively, surround the holes. Problems\npersist: identity conditions for holes and hole-linings do not agree,\nmaking trouble for the paraphrasing of identity statements involving\nholes. But let us end the story here: enough has been said to\nillustrate how the method of paraphrase might used to avoid prima\nfacie ontological commitments.\nAvoiding ontological commitment, however, is not the only role that\nparaphrase plays in ontological disputes. The method of paraphrase has\nalso been used to bring hidden ontological commitments of ordinary\ndiscourse to the fore. One prominent example is Davidson's (1967)\nargument that action sentences are committed to an ontology of\nevents. For example, to explain the logical inference from \u201cJohn\nwalked slowly\u201d to \u201cJohn walked\u201d, we should treat the\nadverb \u2018slowly\u2019 as a description of an event over which\nthese sentences tacitly quantify. Paraphrases of action sentences into\nthe regimented portion of our language will thus be ontologically\ncommitted to events. A second well-known example is Lewis's argument\nfrom Counterfactuals that modal discourse, as he understands\nit, is committed to possible worlds: \n\nIt is uncontroversially true that things might be otherwise than\nthey are. \u2026 Ordinary language permits the paraphrase: there are\nmany ways things could have been besides the way they actually\nare. \u2026 I believe permissible paraphrases of what I believe;\ntaking the paraphrase at its face value, I therefore believe in the\nexistence of entities that might be called \u2018ways things could\nhave been\u2019. I prefer to call them \u2018possible worlds\u2019.\n(Lewis 1973: 84)\n\nIn both of these cases, a version of the method of paraphrase is\nused to support, rather than avoid, commitment to controversial\nontology.\nThe method of paraphrase provides a clear, well-defined\nstrategy\u2014some would say the only such\nstrategy[42]\u2014for\n determining the ontological\ncommitments of the two parties to an ontological dispute. But there\nhave been objections to the method, both early and late. Early on,\nAlston (1958) posed more or less the following dilemma (see also\nJackson 1980). Either the paraphrase and the sentence being\nparaphrased have the same truth conditions, or they do not. If they\ndo, then they cannot differ in their ontological commitments; for the\nrole of truth conditions, in part, is to specify what must exist in\norder for the sentence to be true. But then the method of paraphrase\ncannot be used to avoid ontological commitment. Suppose then that the\nparaphrase and the sentence being paraphrased do not have the same\ntruth conditions.  Then the paraphrase does nothing to support the\nclaim that the original sentence can be used without incurring\nontological commitment.  Indeed, whatever the precise relation\nbetween the paraphrase and the sentence being paraphrased, nothing\njustifies reading the ontological commitments of the original\nsentence off the paraphrase rather than the other way around (compare\nthe neo-Fregean account in \u00a75.2).\nThe best response on behalf of the defender of the method of\nparaphrase is to reject the assumption that the goal of paraphrase is\nto capture the truth conditions, or the ontological commitments, of\nthe original. For Quine, an acceptable paraphrase is just a sentence\nthat \u201cserves any purposes [of the original] that seem worth\nserving\u201d (Quine 1960: 214). A stronger notion of paraphrase is\nruled out because the truth conditions, and so the ontological\ncommitments, of sentences in ordinary language are, for the most\npart, semantically indeterminate. In applying the method of\nparaphrase, we ask the philosopher to make her ordinary language\ntheory precise through the process of regimentation, not to uncover\nthe hidden commitments of the original\ntheory.[43] If\nshe complies, then the ontological commitments of the regimented\ntheory can be attributed to her.  But there is no going back to\nassign ontological commitments to the original theory couched in\nordinary language.[44]\nMore recent critics of the method of paraphrase see the search for\nparaphrase as fundamentally misguided. Sider (1999), for example,\nsuggests that the project of discovering the ontological commitments\nof ordinary language should proceed by searching, not for paraphrases,\nbut for underlying truths (see also Melia 1995 and Yablo 1999\nfor related critiques). Suppose some sentence in ordinary language\nthat we use in describing the world is prima facie committed\nto Ks. Nonetheless, the attitude that we take to the sentence\nmay be something weaker than believing the sentence true. In that\ncase, our use of that sentence need not commit us to Ks, even\nif all acceptable paraphrases are committed to Ks. To get at\nour commitments, we should look, not to paraphrases, but to the truths\nthat underlie the descriptive role of the sentence; our commitment is\nthe commitment of those underlying truths. Roughly, we can say that\nthe underlying truths are true propositions that would still have been\ntrue and would have been sufficient for the truth of the original\nsentence, if there had been Ks (see Sider 1999:\n332\u20133). To illustrate with a simple example, consider the\nsentence: \u201cthe number of moons of Jupiter is sixty-seven\u201d.\nSuppose a philosopher uses this sentence to describe the world, but\ndoes not want to accept its prima facie commitment to\nnumbers. If, as seems plausible, the underlying truths for the\nsentence are just propositions stating what physical objects are in\nthe vicinity of Jupiter and what their motions are, then the sentence\nis ontologically committed only to those physical objects, not to\nnumbers. We may not know what these underlying truths are, or be able\nto express them in ordinary language. That matters not. For, unlike\nthe method of paraphrase, the philosopher is under no obligation to\nprovide the underlying truths in order to acquit herself of\nthe prima facie commitments. She can justify her use of\nsentences that are prima facie committed to numbers as long\nas she holds that there are underlying truths, and that the underlying\ntruths are not so committed.\n",
