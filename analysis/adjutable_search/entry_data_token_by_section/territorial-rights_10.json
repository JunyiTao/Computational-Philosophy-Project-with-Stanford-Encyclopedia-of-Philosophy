    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Territory || Justice accounts\n3.3 Justice accounts\n\nThere are many theorists of justice and political obligation who adopt\na Kantian view of the justification of the state, but fewer who try to\napply this theory to justify territory. A fairly typical view is\nexpressed by Allen Buchanan who argues that \u201cthe chief moral\npurpose of endowing an entity with political power is to achieve\njustice\u2026\u201d (Buchanan 2003a: 247; Waldron 2009). He then\nclarifies that justice involves acceptance of human rights, due\nprocess and the rule of law. This basically Kantian view is very\nhelpful for explaining why we need states, but, like Kant\u2019s own\naccount, has difficulty explaining where the state ought to wield that\npower (the particularity problem). This in turn gives rise to three\ndistinct, but inter-related, problems, and manoeuvres to deal with\nthat problem.\n\nBecause Kantian theory has no internal mechanism to address the\nparticularity problem, it accords rights over territory\nretrospectively, after some group or agent has succeeded in gaining\npolitical power. This seems unacceptable for a theory that, in other\nways, is guided by the importance of justice and the rule of law, and\ndeeply sub-optimal for a theory of territory, which ought to be able\nto adduce normative principles to adjudicate cases where more than one\npolitical community has claims to the same territory.\n\nAnother problem is that, as a theory of territory, it seems very\ndemanding. If states do not have rights over territory unless they are\njust states, then, one implication of the argument is that even on a\nrelatively minimalist view of justice (involving guarantees of human\nrights and due process), no state legitimately exercised territorial\nrights over its political community at any time prior to the twentieth\ncentury, and most states, even now, do not have legitimate territorial\nrights over their area (Banai 2014). But this seems counter-intuitive.\nOne of the reasons why imperialism was thought to be wrong is that it\nrepresents a violation of the colonized state\u2019s territorial\nrights. But if, say, Morocco had no territorial rights over its\nterritory in the nineteenth Century, when it was colonized by France\n(on the reasonable assumption that Morocco was not, at the time, human\nrights-respecting), then there was no specific wrong about\nimperialism, or indeed any specific violation in French governance\nover that territory. Of course, we could just say that French rule\nturned out to be wrongful because it turned out to be unjust, but that\nargument would also apply to the rule that preceded imperialism and\nthe rule after decolonization, which some have argued is\ncounter-intuitive (Moore 2014, 2015, 2019a).\n\nA third problem, which is closely related to the two difficulties\nabove, is that most theorists who adopt this line of argument tend to\ndistinguish full justice from legitimacy, and so confer territorial\nrights on less-than-ideally just states. This means that while the\ntheory seems to set the bar quite high in terms of the justification\nof the state, it is low when it is applied to actual states,\nespecially when we examine the historical trajectory that enabled the\nstate to gain rights over that geographical space. Many states have\noriginated in deeply unjust practices: they gained territory through\nconquest, trickery and other forms of brutality. This sits uneasily\nwith the overall emphasis on justice in the theory. It also introduces\na problematic, because very status quo-oriented realpolitik\nelement into the theory, and so tends to justify existing territorial\norders, including ones that gained their territory through conquest\nand deceit. This may be a problem in Lea Ypi\u2019s justice based\naccount (Ypi 2014), which contends that states are only\n\u201cprovisionally\u201d as opposed to \u201cconclusively\u201d\njustified until we have an international agreement on existing\nterritory. But since having a universal agreement on territory is very\nunlikely in the medium to long-term future, this amounts to accepting\n(albeit with the adjective \u2018provisionally\u2019) whatever\nterritorial entities there currently are, and treating these as\n\u2018provisionally\u2019 rightful.\n",
