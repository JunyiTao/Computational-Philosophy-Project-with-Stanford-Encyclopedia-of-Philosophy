    "main_text": "Practical Philosophy || Ethics\n3.1 Ethics\n3.1.1 Virtue ethics\n\nLike most medieval authors, Olivi can be understood as a virtue\nethicist. As with many of them, however, he does not defend virtue\nethics in its strict Aristotelian guise. To begin with, he criticizes\nthe Thomistic position, according to which some moral virtues are in\nthe sensory part of the soul, but he is also critical of Bonaventure,\nwho held that virtues belong to the free choice (liberum\narbitrium) and thus include both the will and the intellect.\nInstead, Olivi places all virtues, including prudence, firmly in the\nwill. Other powers of the soul may participate in these virtues due to\ntheir connection to the will, but apart from this connection they have\nno real virtues (Kent 1995, 233\u201336; Summa III q. 4, pp.\n224\u201325, 231). Virtues, on Olivi\u2019s account, are stable\ndispositions (or habits, habitus) of the will, which are\ngenerated by repeated actions, and they make good choices easier for\nthe agent (Summa II q. 58, p. 432).\n\nMoreover, Olivi is careful to secure the freedom and autonomy of the\nwill even against its own dispositions: virtues and vices do not\ndetermine our choices. A virtuous person is more likely to make good\nchoices than a vicious one, but ultimately every choice is always up\nto the will (Bobiller 2020, 155\u201356), and the agent can always\nact against her virtuous or vicious dispositions. Olivi emphasizes\nthat this kind of freedom is a necessary condition for being morally\nresponsible of one\u2019s actions: \u201cWhere the freedom of the\nwill is missing, there is absolutely no ground for merit and\ndemerit\u201d (Summa II q. 57, 337). Another important aspect\nof Olivi\u2019s virtue ethics is that he plays down the role of\nexternal action and focuses instead on the will of the agent: the\nmoral value of our actions stems from the internal intention and the\nfree decision to perform those actions (see, e.g. Summa II q.\n113, p. 307; ibid., q. 118, p. 443; Normore 2004, p. 144).\n\nDue to the emphasis on the freedom of the will and the internal\nintention, the individual moral agent is at the center of\nOlivi\u2019s ethics. In particular, his notions of person and\npersonhood are ethically significant, as they comprise two properties\nthat make human beings moral agents: awareness of oneself as the\nsubject and origin of one\u2019s actions and choices, and freedom of\nthe will. The moral agent, for Olivi, is first and foremost a free\nperson, an autonomous individual, who is aware of her own actions as\nsomething that originates in her and who must judge the moral worth of\nher choices by herself (Bobillier 2020, 27\u2013137). In order to\nmake this judgement, the agent must be able to reflect her own (past,\npresent, future) choices against the objective normative order that is\nthe natural law/will of God, which they know via innate conscience and\n\u201cexperiential taste\u201d that explains the affective aspect of\nmoral knowledge (Bobillier 2020, 144\u201367; Summa II qq.\n81\u201382).\n\nOlivi\u2019s radical voluntarism leads him also to treat Aristotelian\nakrasia in a special way: literally as weakness of the\nwill that explains why the agent chooses agains his better\nknowledge. Genuine cases of akrasia (in which the person is not making\nan intellectual error, e.g., due to the influence of emotions) exist\nand they reveal the fundamental nature of the will, namely, that its\nfreedom is not bound by intellectual judgments or emotional outbursts\n(Kent 1984, 184\u2013205; Bobillier 2020, 239, 252\u201360). Olivi\nargues explicitly against the view he takes to be Aristotle\u2019s,\nnamely that the conclusion of the practical syllogism is action or\nnecessarily turns into action. He emphasizes that since the will is\nabsolutely free, the conclusion of the practical syllogism must be\naccepted by the will before it turns into action, and the will can\nalways reject the conclusion, thus leading the agent to reconsider the\nsituation at hand. Moreover, he thinks that when an akratic person\nchooses to perform a morally wrong action, he may be fully aware that\nit is against the moral law. In Olivi\u2019s view, human beings are\nable to consider one and the same action from many angles at the same\ntime; they can think simultaneously several universal premises and\ncombine them freely with the particular premise, thus reaching\ncontrary conclusions: this act of fornication is both morally\nblameworthy and pleasant, and I am free to choose whether I go\nfor it or not (Summa II qq. 85\u201386, 186\u201391; ibid.,\nq. 57, pp. 309\u201310; see Toivanen 2012).\n\nThus, an akratic person knows actually that what he is about to do is\na sin, but his knowledge is theoretical and lacks the experiential\naffective aspect. By contrast, he finds the sinful action pleasant\nbecause his thought concerning it has this aspect to it (Bobillier\n2020, 257\u201358; Summa II q. 86, p. 193). To be sure, even\nthis experiential mode of thinking does not determine the will, and\nthus an akratic can always decide to do otherwise, and he is fully\nresponsible for his choice. Olivi criticizes the Aristotelian theory\nfor taking away the responsibility due to a momentary lack of\nunderstanding, caused by emotion (see e.g. Bobillier 2020, pp.\n254\u201356). In the end, there is no other explanation for bad\nchoices except that the person wills to make them.\n\nOne central difference between Olivi\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s\napproaches to virtue ethics is that while the latter thinks that a\nperson\u2019s moral character determines how he acts after the\npractical reasoning is done, Olivi argues that there always remains a\nchoice. Although one\u2019s moral character may statistically guide\nhim to choose a certain type of action, Olivi\u2019s focus is more on\nthe actual choice, which is in all cases completely free. Moral\neducation and habituation may improve one\u2019s ability to make\nmorally good choices, but ultimately moral improvement is a matter of\nsimply starting to do the right thing instead of wrong one. Thus,\nOlivi is a virtue ethicist but his virtue ethics is of a different\nbreed than Aristotle\u2019s.\n3.1.2 Unity of virtues\n\nOne question that late thirteenth-century authors discussed was\nrelated to the unity of the virtues. It was prompted by\nAugustine\u2019s critique of the Stoic position as well as by\nCicero\u2019s De officiis (Kent 1984, pp. 523\u201325), and\nit received a new impetus with Aristotle\u2019s argument that a\nvirtuous person necessarily has all virtues of character because\nprudence is necessary for each genuine virtue, and prudence in turn\nentails all other virtues (EN 6.12\u201313). The idea is\nroughly that a prudent person can grasp what is the best course of\naction all things considered, and this requires finding a\ncorrect balance that meets the requirements of all virtues: one who\nacts bravely must also act justly because unjust bravery is not a real\nvirtue.\n\nMany medieval philosophers accepted this view, but not all, and\ntowards the end of the thirteenth century critical voices were raised;\nOlivi seems to be one of the first to reject it completely. He thinks\nthat it is possible to have one virtue while lacking others, and his\nstrategy to ward off the Aristotelian theory is to argue that prudence\nitself is not one monolithic whole. Even if prudence turns out to be\nnecessary for every moral virtue, it is possible to possess only the\npart of prudence that is proper to one particular virtue:\n\n\n[\u2026] as moral virtue contains many virtues that differ from each\nother by their genera and species, so prudence contains many prudences\nor many partial dispositions. (Summa III q. 6, p. 277)\n\n\nIt is possible to, e.g., exercise moderation with respect to food and\ndrink and yet be covetous and amass money without limits, and the\nprudence that aids the agent to exercise moderation does not\nnecessarily convince him of the viciousness of covetousness. Virtues\nare essentially independent of each other. However, Olivi acknowledges\nthe unity of virtues in the sense that in order to become a fully\nvirtuous person, one must acquire all specific virtues. A virtuous\nagent functions as the unifying factor (Wood 1997, pp.\n51\u201353).\n\nMoreover, Olivi thinks that virtues may support each other in\npractical life. In particular, he argues that voluntary poverty is not\nonly one of the virtues but actually the highest virtue (QPE q.\n8, p. 85). It is not suitable for everyone but only for those who are\nable to follow Franciscan ideals. However, for the latter it proves to\nbe essential as it leads to a host of other virtues such as chastity,\nfortitude, generosity, magnanimity\u2014and to humility, which Olivi\nconsiders as abandonment of oneself and submission to the will of God\n(Bobillier 2020, 193\u2013222). In contrast to humility, wrongly\ndirected self-love and pride are the sources of all vices (Bobillier\n2020, pp. 217\u201321, pp. 236\u201352).\n3.2 Political Philosophy\n3.2.1 Poverty\n\nAlthough Olivi did not leave behind systematic treatises on political\nphilosophy, his works touched upon several politically loaded\ntheological and philosophical ideas. In particular, he played a\ncentral role in the controversy over how rigorously to understand the\nFranciscan vow of poverty, which would have a lasting effect on\nmedieval political reality (Burr 1989, 2001). Although the controversy\ncentered on Franciscan poverty and was thus strongly motivated by\ntheological worries and Church politics, it is not difficult to see\nthat it has several philosophical dimensions to it. For instance, it\nhas been argued that the modern conception of subjective rights was\nfirst developed in the debate between the Franciscan order and the\npope over the correct interpretation of poverty and the vow (see,\ne.g., van Duffel 2010).\n\nFranciscans held that the vow of poverty requires renouncing ownership\n(dominium), but that using products owned by someone\nelse (e.g., the Church) does not violate the vow. However, the\nquestion that divided them in the latter half of the thirteenth\ncentury was whether the vow requires that, even when merely using the\ngoods of another, one adheres to strict standards of austerity, the\nso-called \u201cpoor use\u201d (usus pauper). Olivi insisted\non these strict standards but claimed that they are part of the vow\nonly indeterminately. This means first that not every violation is a\nmortal sin, provided that one\u2019s general tendency is to strive\nfor spiritual humility by living poorly. It also means that what\nexactly counts as poor use depends on the circumstances and situation,\nsince it is impossible to find a precise and fixed line between poor\nand lax use of commodities. In other words, Olivi admitted a certain\nlatitude and flexibility in this notion (Burr 2001, pp.\n51\u201353).\n\nAnother central idea for Olivi was that one should not obey\none\u2019s superiors if obeying their commands entails sinful action\nor the violation of the Franciscan vow, thus endangering one\u2019s\nsalvation. Given Olivi\u2019s flexible view of the scope of the poor\nuse, this last restriction makes the limit between the duties of\nobedience and disobedience vague. Each individual friar must judge in\nhis own conscience whether he should obey or disobey (and ultimately\nprotest) the commands of their superiors. It is not surprising that\nOlivi\u2019s theoretical model of the vow, in conjunction with the\npotential for disobedience, fueled the political controversy within\nthe Franciscan order and the Church (Burr 2001, pp. 64\u201365).\n\nFrom a philosophical perspective, one of the most important aspects of\nOlivi\u2019s view is the connection between the freedom of the will\nand the evangelical vow\u2019s renunciation of ownership understood\nas dominion (dominium). The idea that ownership is a form of\ndominion stems from a more general theory according to which freedom\nof the will can be understood as a dominion that one has over\none\u2019s will. This dominion is extended to one\u2019s body and\nexternal actions, and ultimately to external goods. Olivi thinks that\nthe Franciscan vow means not only giving up the dominion over external\ngoods but also over one\u2019s own actions (obedience) and ultimately\none\u2019s own freedom, as it means subjection to the will of God.\nYet, when someone voluntarily subjects his will to God, he\nparadoxically proclaims his ultimate freedom: the vow must be\ncontinuously renewed. The choice to give up the freedom of the will is\na voluntary choice that is freely given every moment as long as one\nkeeps to the vow (QPE, q. 8, p. 169; QPE, q. 14, p.\n135; Piron 1996; Toivanen 2016a).\n3.2.2 The nature of political power\n\nOne of the most important texts where Olivi deals with political\nphilosophy is his Quid ponat ius (= Summa IV q. 1). His aim in\nthis text is to provide a theoretical foundation for his discussion on\nthe sacraments, and he considers it useful to start with a detailed\nanalysis of the ontology of political power and property rights.\nAlthough it has been pointed out that Olivi seems to prefer a mixed\nform of government (Blythe 1992, pp. 151\u201352), this particular\ntext does not aim at offering a political theory; it is a\nphilosophical exercise in social ontology, which centers on a question\nconcerning the ontological foundation of relational terms such as\n\u2018right\u2019 (ius), \u2018authority\u2019\n(auctoritas), \u2018power\u2019 (potestas),\n\u2018obligation\u2019 (obligatio), and \u2018property\nright\u2019 (proprietas). (For discussion, see Piron 1996,\n2016; Rode 2014, 2016; Toivanen 2016a.)\n\nOlivi develops his view in relation to two opposing views. According\nto the first view, there must be something real in the end-terms of\nthese relations because otherwise they would not be real: \u201ca\nrelation that posits nothing in the related things is only a relation\naccording to what is said (relatio secundum dici) [\u2026]\nbut it is clear that the power of a king, or any real jurisdiction, or\nobligation, or subordination of some people are really actual even\nwhen none of us thinks or talks about them\u201d (Summa IV q.\n1, par. 7). The second view holds that relational properties such as\ndominium are radically different from natural properties, and\nthat no ontological change takes place when, for instance, someone is\ncrowned a king. Olivi seeks for a position between these two views,\nand he finds one when he argues that relations of this kind are based\non rationes reales (see\n \u00a7 2.1).\n They are real relations in the sense that they do not depend on\nsomeone actually thinking of them but they do not entail any real\n(Aristotelian) ontological addition to the relata.\n\nThe relation that a ruler has to the subjects is a form of dominion,\nand it it principally related to the will of the ruler:\n\n\nTherefore, since this kind of power does not add anything intrinsic to\nthe person of the king, it can relate to the whole person of the king\nin such a way that it will not determinately relate to any of his\npowers, unless it perhaps relates to the free will (liberum\narbitrium) and the powers that are bound to it, insofar as they\nare such. (Summa IV q. 1, par. 53)\n\n\nCoronation extends the dominion of the king over his subjects, and\nthis is due to the human ability to change the normative reality by\nestablishing new relations between human beings, between human beings\nand property, and so forth (Rode 2014, pp. 377\u201378). Although the\nnormative reality ultimately depends on the will of God and natural\nlaw (Rode 2016, pp. 117\u201319), the human will plays an important\nrole in the detailed explanation of how it works.\n3.2.3 Economic theory\n\nIn addition to his philosophical and theological ambitions, Olivi took\npart in a theoretical discussion concerning economic justice. He\ncomposed a short treatise Tractatus de contractibus (ed. Piron\n2012) while he was working at the Franciscan studium generale\nof Narbonne in mid-1290s. The work is a theoretical treatise that is\nrelated to the moral dimension of economic activities and it was\nprobably occasioned by pastoral duties that Franciscan friars had in\nan urban context. Although Olivi\u2019s views can be traced back to\nearlier discussions on Roman and Canon law, as well as other works\ndealing with just price, scholars have also argued that his overall\napproach profoundly changed medieval economic theory (Kaye 1998, 2014;\nLangholm 1992, 1998; Piron 2012; Todeschini 2009; a more critical\nevaluation is Kirshner and Lo Prete 1984).\n\nIn De contractibus Olivi discusses several topics related to\nthe morality of economic activity, such as contracts, commerce, usury,\nvalue, and capital. The first question of the treatise serves as an\nillustrative example of his general approach to economics. It focuses\non the notion of just price, which Olivi analyzes with the intention\nof setting normative limits that regulate but do not completely\nprevent economic activity. As in Quid ponat ius, he proposes a\ntheory that reconciles two sets of opposing arguments. According to\nthe first set of arguments, a voluntary contract between a buyer and a\nseller suffices to establish a just price. The price the parties\nfreely agree upon is just, because any other way of setting the just\nprice would make commercial activities liable to immorality. Without\nfull knowledge of the just price, the buyer and the seller might\naccidentally deviate from it and thus sin. By contrast, the second set\nof arguments aims to prove that there must be objectively determinable\nlimits for the just price. Otherwise there might be a situation in\nwhich someone charges an extremely high price for a glass of water,\nand one who is dying of thirst pays it voluntarily, thereby making the\nprice just. Thus, all deviations from the objectively just price are\nagainst the principles of justice.\n\nOlivi treats just price in a similar way as usus pauper: it\ncannot be a pre-fixed and universally applicable single point but\nthere must be some amount of latitude and flexibility to it. He adopts\nthe Aristotelian idea of virtuous action as a middle-point between two\nopposing vices: just as virtue is not a fixed middle that can be known\na priori but depends on the context and situation, so just price has\nlimits but is open to variation due to various contextual factors.\n(Piron 2012, p. 45.) There are normative limits for the just\nprice\u2014for instance, vital needs may force the buyer to agree on\na price that is unjust, but the seller should refrain from asking more\nthan a fair price. Yet, the flexibility of the limits of just price\nleave room for economic activity and allow merchants to profit, and\nwithin these limits the participants agree on the price freely. Olivi\nalso submits that if neither party deceives the other and both enter\nthe transaction freely (no compelling circumstances obtain), one may\neven give away one\u2019s commodities for free.\n\nOlivi provides more detailed set of criteria for determining the\nlimits of just price in various situations in scholastic literature\n(Kaye 2014, p. 114). Among these criteria are the obvious quality of\nthe commodity, the materials and the amount of work needed to produce\nit, and rarity, but also individual desires and personal values (De\ncontractibus 1.1, pp. 98\u2013102; Toivanen 2016b). Further, he\nargues that the just price is affected by social factors such as\ncommon estimation and common needs, and that ultimately economic\nactivity exists for the sake of the common good of the community\n(Tractatus de contractibus 1.2, pp. 108\u201310). In this way,\nOlivi\u2019s analysis reflects the fact that medieval economic\ndiscourse was fundamentally normative and related to moral\ntheology\u2014unlike contemporary economics, which is more\ndescriptive and lacks the normative dimension (Piron 2012).",
