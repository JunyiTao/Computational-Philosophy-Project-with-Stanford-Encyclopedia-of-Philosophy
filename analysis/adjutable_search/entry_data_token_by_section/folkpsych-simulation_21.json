    "main_text": "Simulation Theory: Pros and Cons || Developmental Findings\n6.3 Developmental Findings\n\nThe development of mindreading capacities in children has been one of\nthe central areas of empirical investigation. In particular,\ndevelopmental psychologists have put a lot of effort into detailing\nhow the ability to attribute false beliefs to others develops. Until\n2005, the central experimental paradigm to test this ability was the\nverbal false belief task (Wimmer & Perner 1983). Here is\na classic version of it. A subject is introduced to two dolls, Sally\nand Anne, and three objects: Sally\u2019s ball, a basket, and a box.\nSally puts her ball in the basket and leaves the scene. While Sally is\naway, Anne takes the ball out of the basket and puts it into the box.\nSally then returns. The subject is asked where she thinks Sally will\nlook for the ball. The correct answer, of course, is that Sally will\nlook inside the basket. To give this answer, the subject has to\nattribute to Sally the false belief that the ball is in the\nbasket. A number of experiments have found that while four-year old\nchildren pass this task, three-year old children fail it (for a\nreview, see Wellman et al. 2001). For a long time, the mainstream\ninterpretation of these findings has been that children acquire the\nability to attribute false beliefs only around their fourth birthday\n(but see Clements & Perner 1994 and Bloom & German 2000).\n\nIn 2005, this developmental timeline was called into question.\nKristine Onishi and Ren\u00e9e Baillargeon (2005) published the\nresult of a non-verbal version of the false belief task,\nwhich they administered to 15-month old infants. The experiment\ninvolves three steps. First, the infants see a toy between two boxes,\none yellow and one green, and then an actor hiding the toy inside the\ngreen box. Next, the infants see the toy sliding out of the green box\nand hiding inside the yellow box. In the true belief condition (TB),\nthe actor notices that the toy changes location, while in the false\nbelief condition (FB) she does not. Finally, half of the infants see\nthe actor reaching into the green box, while the other half sees the\nactor reaching into the yellow box. According to the\nviolation-of-expectation paradigm, infants reliably look for\na longer time at unexpected events. Therefore, if the infants expected\nthe actor to search for the toy on the basis of the\nactor\u2019s belief about its location, then when the actor had a\ntrue belief that the toy was hidden in one box, the infants\nshould look longer when the actor reached into the other box instead.\nConversely, the infants should look longer at one box when the actor\nfalsely believed that the toy was hidden in the other box.\nStrikingly, these predictions were confirmed in both the (TB) and (FB)\nconditions. On this basis, Onishi and Baillargeon (2005) concluded\nthat children of 15 months possess the capacity to represent\nothers\u2019 false beliefs.\n\nThis and subsequent versions of non-verbal false belief tasks\nattracted a huge amount of interest (at the current stage of research,\nthere is evidence that sensitivity to others\u2019 false beliefs is\npresent in infants as young as 7 months\u2014for a review, see\nBaillargeon at al. 2016). Above all, the following two questions have\nbeen widely discussed: why do children pass the non-verbal false\nbelief task at such an early age, but do not pass the verbal version\nbefore the age of 4? Does passing the non-verbal false belief task\nreally indicate the capacity to represent others\u2019 false beliefs?\n(Perner & Ruffman 2005; Apperly & Butterfill 2009; Baillargeon\net al. 2010; Carruthers 2013; Helming et al. 2014).\n\nGoldman and Jordan (2013) maintain that ST has a good answer to both\nquestions. To begin with, they argue that it is implausible to\nattribute to infants such sophisticated meta-representational\nabilities as the ability to represent others\u2019 false beliefs.\nThus, Goldman and Jordan favour a deflationary view, according to\nwhich infants are sensitive to others\u2019 false beliefs,\nbut do not represent them as such. In particular, they\npropose that rather than believing that another subject S\n(falsely) believes that p, infants simply imagine how the\nworld is from S\u2019s perspective\u2014that is, they simply\nimagine that p is the case. This\u2014Goldman and Jordan\nsay\u2014is a more primitive psychological competence than\nmindreading, since it does not involve forming a judgment about\nothers\u2019 mental states. This brings us to Goldman and\nJordan\u2019s answer to the question \u201cwhy do children pass the\nverbal false belief task only at four?\u201d Passing this task\nrequires fully-fledged mindreading abilities and executive functions\nsuch as inhibitory control. It takes quite a lot of time\u2014around\n3 to 4 years\u2014before these functions and abilities come\nonline.\n",
