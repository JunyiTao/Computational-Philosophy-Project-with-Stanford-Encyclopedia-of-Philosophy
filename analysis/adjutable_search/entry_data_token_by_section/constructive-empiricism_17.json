One might worry, though, as\nJames Ladyman (2000) does, that such a view brings with it a\ncommitment to modal realism and belief in whatever entities such a\ncommitment may require. So, for instance, talk of observability might\ncommit the constructive empiricist to belief in the existence of\npossible worlds, a commitment that an empiricist would prefer not to\nmake.\n\nTo understand why one might think this way, consider the following. As\nnoted in section 1.6 above, one natural way of understanding\n\u201cx is observable\u201d is in the following\ncounterfactual manner:\n\nx is observable iff if a suitably constituted observer were in\nrelevant circumstances C, she would observe x.\n\n\nIf the truth conditions of counterfactuals are understood in terms of\npossible worlds, it is easy to see how beliefs about what is\nobservable entail commitments to the existence of such worlds.\n\nOne reply to this threat of modal realism is that contrary to the\ninitial impression provided by the counterfactual characterization of\nobservability, observability is not a modal property, after all\n(Monton and van Fraassen 2003, 411). As explained in section 2.5\nabove, van Fraassen takes the truth of counterfactuals to be\ncontext-dependent. Once a context is fixed, counterfactuals can be\nexpressed as non-modal conditionals. In the case of the\ncounterfactuals that explicate observability, then, fixing the\nepistemic community of the \u201csuitably constituted observer\u201d\ntransforms the counterfactuals into straightforward non-modal\nconditionals whose truth or lack thereof we can empirically\ninvestigate (Monton and van Fraassen 2003, 413\u2013414). Belief in\nthe truth of some claim of the form \u2019x is observable\u2019\namounts simply to belief in the truth of such a context-fixed,\nnon-modal conditional.\n\nWhether such conditionals are true is an empirical question to which\nour best scientific theories may provide an answer. So even though\nobservability represents some objective, theory-independent property\nof the world (van Fraassen 1980, 57), we can use our best scientific\ntheories to answer the question, \u201cWhat is observable?\u201d\n(Monton and van Fraassen 2003, 415\u2013416):\n\nConsider the claim \u2018if the moons of Jupiter were present to us\n(in the right kind of circumstances) then we would observe\nthem\u2019. The way to understand the claim is to note that, even\nthough it is a counterfactual, it is entailed by facts about the\nworld: facts that the moons of Jupiter are constituted in a certain\nway, and facts that we are constituted in a certain way. These facts\ncan be disclosed by empirical research. In practice, not all the\nempirical research has been done, so we have to rely on our current\nbest theories to determine what these facts are.\n\n\nFor worries about methodological circularity in using our accepted\ntheories to supply facts about observability\u2014facts that bear on\nthe theories\u2019 own empirical adequacy\u2014see section 3.7\nbelow.\n\nOne additional worry about Monton and van Fraassen\u2019s non-modal\ncharacterization of observability is given by Ladyman (2004). Consider\nthe claim \u2018x is observable\u2019 for some x that\nis never actually observed. Ladyman asserts that no empirical\ninvestigation will be sufficient to establish the truth of the\nrelevant non-modal conditional \u201cunless we take it that the\nspecification by science of some regularities among the actual facts\nas laws \u2026 is latching onto objective features of the\nworld\u201d (Ladyman 2004, 762). As Ladyman sees it, only objectively\nexisting laws, and not pragmatically selected empirical regularities,\ncan underwrite claims about the observability of objects never\nactually observed.\n\nPaul Dicken (2007) offers another promising way for the constructive\nempiricist to resist the threat of a commitment to modal realism that\nis posed by talk of observability. He suggests that the constructive\nempiricist take the same attitude toward the truth of observability\ncounterfactuals that she takes toward other claims of endorsed\nscientific theories: namely, acceptance of the counterfactuals rather\nthan belief in them (608).\n\nIndeed, given that observability is itself supposed to be a subject of\nscientific theory (as noted above), acceptance is the natural attitude\nfor a constructive empiricist to take toward the counterfactuals that\nexplicate observability. She relies on those counterfactuals in the\nway she relies on the other elements of the theories she accepts, even\n(in certain contexts) talking as if the counterfactuals are true. In\nthis way, according to Dicken, she can make use of claims about what\nis observable while at the same time being agnostic about possible\nworlds whose existence is purportedly entailed by the truth of the\ncounterfactuals explicating observability.\n",
