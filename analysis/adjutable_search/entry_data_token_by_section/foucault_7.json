The first volume of this project, The\nHistory of Sexuality, Vol. I: The Will to Knowledge, published in\n1976, was intended as the introduction to a series of studies on\nparticular aspects of modern sexuality (children, women,\n\u201cperverts,\u201d population). It outlined the project of the\noverall history, explaining the basic viewpoint and the methods to be\nused.\n\nOn Foucault\u2019s account, modern control of sexuality parallels\nmodern control of criminality by making sex (like crime) an object of\nallegedly scientific disciplines, which simultaneously offer knowledge\nand domination of their objects. However, it becomes apparent that\nthere is a further dimension in the power associated with the sciences\nof sexuality. Not only is there control exercised via other\npeople\u2019s knowledge of individuals such as doctors\u2019\nknowledge, for example; there is also control via individuals\u2019\nknowledge of themselves. Individuals internalize the norms laid down\nby the sciences of sexuality and monitor themselves in an effort to\nconform to these norms. Thus, they are controlled not only as\nobjects of disciplines but also as self-scrutinizing and\nself-forming subjects.\n\nFoucault shows how sexuality becomes an essential construct in\ndetermining not only moral worth, but also health, desire, and\nidentity. Subjects are further obligated to tell the truth about\nthemselves by confessing the details of their sexuality. Foucault\nargued that modern sexuality was characterized by the secularization\nof religious techniques of confession: one no longer confesses the\ndetails of one\u2019s sexual desire to a priest; one goes to a\ndoctor, a therapist, a psychologist, or a psychiatrist.\n\nThe book begins with a repudiation of the \u201crepressive\nhypothesis,\u201d the idea that sexuality in the Victorian era was\nrepressed and discourse on it silenced. Foucault claims that\nrepression did not characterize the primary attitude of modern society\ntowards sex; rather, sexuality became the object of new kinds of\ndiscourse\u2014medical, juridical and psychological \u00ad\u2013 and\nthat discourse on it actually increased. Sexuality was inextricably\nlinked to truth: these new discourses were able to tell us the\nscientific truth about ourselves through our sexuality.\n\nAlthough the book is a historical study of the emergence of modern\nsexuality in the nineteenth century, Foucault\u2019s targets were\nalso contemporary ideas and practices. The prevalent views on\nsexuality in the 1960s and 1970s held that there was a natural and\nhealthy sexuality that all human beings shared simply in virtue of\nbeing human, and this sexuality was presently repressed by cultural\nprohibitions and conventions such as bourgeois morality and capitalist\nsocio-economic structures. Repressed sexuality was the cause of\nvarious neuroses and it was important to have an active and free\nsexuality. The popular discourse on sexuality thus fervently argued\nfor sexual liberation: we had to liberate our true sexuality from the\nrepressive mechanisms of power.\n\nFoucault challenged this view by showing how our conceptions and\nexperiences of sexuality are in fact always the result of specific\ncultural conventions and mechanisms of power and could not exist\nindependently of them. The mission to liberate our repressed sexuality\nwas thus fundamentally misguided because there was no authentic or\nnatural sexuality to liberate. To free oneself from one set of norms\nonly meant adopting different norms in their stead, and that could\nturn out to be just as controlling and normalizing. He wrote mockingly\nthat the irony of our endless preoccupation with sexuality was that we\nbelieved that it had something to do with our liberation.\n\nIn order to challenge the dominant view of the relationship between\nsexuality and repressive power, Foucault had to re-conceive the nature\nof power. His major claim is that power is not essentially repressive\nbut productive. It does not operate by repressing and prohibiting the\ntrue and authentic expressions of a natural sexuality. Instead it\nproduces, through cultural normative practices and scientific\ndiscourses, the ways in which we experience and conceive of our\nsexuality. Power relations are \u201cthe internal conditions\u201d\nof our sexual identities.\n\nFoucault outlined what became one of the most influential contemporary\nunderstandings of power in a series of short propositions over three\npages of The History of Sexuality, Volume 1. He elucidated\nand developed this understanding of power in a number of essays,\nlectures and interviews throughout the rest of his life, but the basic\nidea was already present in these pages. We should not try to look for\nthe center of power, or for the individuals, institutions or classes\nthat rule, but should rather construct a \u201cmicrophysics of\npower\u201d that focuses on the multitude of loci of power spread\nthroughout a society: families, workplaces, everyday practices, and\nmarginal institutions. One has to analyze power relations from the\nbottom up and not from the top down, and to study the myriad ways in\nwhich the subjects themselves are constituted in these diverse but\nintersecting networks.\n\nAlthough dispersed among various interlacing networks throughout\nsociety, power nevertheless has a rationality, a series of aims and\nobjectives, and the means of attaining them. This does not imply that\nany individual has consciously formulated them. As the example of the\nPanopticon shows, power often functions according to a clear\nrationality irrespective of the intentions and motives of the\nindividual who guards the prison from the tower. Despite the\ncentrality of the Panopticon as a model for power, Foucault does not\nhold that power forms a deterministic system of overbearing\nconstraints. Power should rather be understood and analyzed as an\nunstable network of practices implying that where there is power,\nthere is always resistance too. Just as there is no center of power,\nthere is no center of resistance somewhere outside of it. Resistance\nis rather inherent in power relations and their dynamics, it is\n\u201cthe odd term in the relations of power\u201d (1976 [1978:\n96]). While power relations permeate the whole body of society, they\nmay be denser in some regions and less dense in others.\n\nFoucault\u2019s short but influential discussion of biopower also\nfirst appears at the end of The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1.\nFoucault contrasts it to what he calls sovereign power: a form of\npower that was historically founded on violence\u2014the right to\nkill. It was exercised mainly by \u201cdeduction\u201d (taking\nsomething away): it consisted of the right to appropriate a portion of\nthe nation\u2019s wealth, for example by imposing a tax on products,\ngoods and services, or by demanding a portion of the subjects\u2019\ntime, strength, and ultimately life itself. The obligation to wage war\non behalf of the sovereign and the imposition of death penalty for\ngoing against his will were the clearest forms of such power. But\nFoucault claims that the West has undergone a profound transformation\nin its mechanisms of power since the seventeenth century. Deductive\nand violent sovereign power has been gradually complemented and partly\nreplaced by biopower, a form of power that exerts a positive influence\non life, \u201cthat endeavors to administer, optimize, and multiply\nit, subjecting it to precise controls and comprehensive\nregulations\u201d (1976 [1978: 137]). This era of biopower is marked\nby the explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the\ncontrol of populations: techniques that, for example, coordinate\nmedical care, normalize behavior, rationalize mechanisms of insurance,\nand rethink urban planning. The aim is the effective administration of\nbodies and the calculated management of life through means that are\nscientific and continuous. Mechanisms of power and knowledge have\nassumed responsibility for the life process in order to optimize,\ncontrol, and modify it. The exercise of power over living beings no\nlonger carries the threat of death, but instead takes charge of their\nlives.\n\nThe rationality of biopower is markedly different from that of\nsovereign power in terms not just of its objectives, but also of its\ninstruments. A major consequence of its development is the growing\nimportance of norms at the expense of the juridical system of the law.\nFoucault claims that the dominance of biopower as the paradigmatic\nform of power means that we live in a society in which the power of\nthe law has subsided in favor of regulative and corrective mechanisms\nbased on scientific knowledge. Biopower penetrates traditional forms\nof political power, but it is essentially the power of experts and\nadministrators.\n\nThe genealogical attempt to historicize the body is prominent also in\nThe History of Sexuality, Vol. 1, but now Foucault\u2019s\ntarget is the naturalist explanations of sex and sexuality. At the end\nof the book Foucault takes up the question of whether we can find a\nscientific truth about sex. He makes clear that his genealogical\ninvestigation of sexuality implies a challenge to a certain kind of\nexplanatory framework of sexuality and gender: the idea of sex as a\nnatural foundation or an unobserved cause, which supports the visible\neffects of gender and sexuality. He critically appraises the idea of a\nnatural, scientifically defined true sex by revealing the historical\ndevelopment of this form of thought. He does not claim that sex,\nunderstood as the categories of maleness and femaleness, was invented\nin a particular historical period. He rather analyses the ways in\nwhich these categories were founded and explained in discourses\nclaiming the status of scientific truth, and how this allegedly\n\u201cpure\u201d explanation in fact constituted these categories so\nthat they were understood as \u201cnatural.\u201d This idea has had\nenormous influence on feminist philosophers and queer theorists.\nJudith Butler has appropriated this idea in her influential book\nGender Trouble to argue that allegedly scientific ideas of\nsex as a natural and necessary ground for sexual and gendered\nidentities in fact have a normative function: they constitute our\nconceptions of \u201cnormal\u201d men and women and their\n\u201cnatural\u201d sexual desire for each other.\n",
