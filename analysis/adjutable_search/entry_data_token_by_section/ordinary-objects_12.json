    "main_text": "Against Revisionary Ontologies || Arguments from Entailment\n3.3 Arguments from Entailment\n\nArguments from entailment purport to establish that eliminativism is\nself-defeating, insofar as certain things that eliminativists affirm\nentail the existence of the very ordinary objects that they wish to\neliminate. Here is a representative argument from entailment: \n\n(ET1)\n There are atoms arranged statuewise.\n(ET2)\n If there are atoms arranged statuewise, then there are\nstatues.\n(ET3)\n So, there are statues.\n\n\nNow consider two arguments for ET2: the argument from identity and the\nargument from application conditions.\n\nThe argument from identity proceeds from the assumption that ordinary\nobjects are identical to the smaller objects of which they are\ncomposed. The statue, for instance, is identical to its atomic parts.\nAccordingly, by affirming that there are atoms arranged statuewise,\neliminativists let into their ontology the very things that they had\nintended to\n exclude.[65]\n\n\nHowever, the view that composites are identical to their parts is\nhighly controversial. One common objection is that the identity\nrelation simply isn\u2019t the sort of relation that can hold between\na single thing and many things. Another common objection is that\nordinary objects have different persistence conditions from their\nparts. For instance, the atoms arranged statuewise, unlike the statue,\nwill still exist if the statue disintegrates and the atoms disperse.\nIt would then seem to follow by Leibniz\u2019s Law that the atoms are\nnot identical to the\n statue.[66]\n\n\nThe argument from application conditions arises out of some general\nconsiderations about how it is that kind terms refer to what they do.\nSuppose an archaeologist uncovers an unfamiliar artifact, gestures\ntowards it, and introduces the name \u2018woodpick\u2019 for things\nof that kind. Yet there are numerous things before her: the woodpick,\nthe woodpick\u2019s handle, the facing surface of the woodpick, etc.\nFurthermore, the woodpick itself belongs to numerous kinds:\nwoodpick, tool, artifact, etc. So how is it\nthat \u2018woodpick\u2019 came to denote woodpicks rather than\nsomething else? (This is an instance of what is known as the\nqua problem.) It must be because the speaker associates\ncertain application conditions and perhaps other descriptive\ninformation with the term \u2018woodpick\u2019, which single out\nwoodpicks\u2014rather than all tools or just the facing surfaces of\nwoodpicks\u2014as the denotation of the term. And the same is\nplausibly so for already-entrenched kind terms like\n\u2018statue\u2019: their reference is largely determined by the\napplication conditions that speakers associate with\n them.[67]\n\n\nArmed with this account of reference determination, one might then\nargue for ET2 as follows. The application conditions that competent\nspeakers associate with \u2018statue\u2019\u2014together with facts\nabout the distribution of atoms\u2014determine whether it applies to\nsomething. But these applications conditions are fairly undemanding:\nnothing further is required for their satisfaction than that there be\natoms arranged statuewise. Accordingly, so long as there are atoms\narranged statuewise, \u2018statue\u2019 does apply to something,\nfrom which it trivially follows that there are\n statues.[68]\n\nThis argument may be resisted on the grounds that the application\nconditions that ordinary speakers associate with \u2018statue\u2019\naren\u2019t quite so undemanding. It\u2019s not enough simply that\nthere be atoms arranged statuewise. Rather, there must be an object\nthat is composed of the atoms\u2014and (eliminativists might go on to\ninsist) there are no such objects. However, those who are moved by the\nqua problem might respond that \u2018object\u2019 itself must be\nassociated with application conditions, which are likewise\nsufficiently undemanding as to be satisfied so long as there are atoms\narranged\n statuewise.[69]\n",
