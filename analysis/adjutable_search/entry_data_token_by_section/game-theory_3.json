    "main_text": "Basic Elements and Assumptions of Game Theory || Trees and Matrices\n2.3 Trees and Matrices\n\nThe difference between games of perfect and of imperfect information\nis related to (though certainly not identical with!) a distinction\nbetween ways of representing games that is based on order\nof play. Let us begin by distinguishing between sequential-move\nand simultaneous-move games in terms of information. It is natural, as\na first approximation, to think of sequential-move games as being ones\nin which players choose their strategies one after the other, and of\nsimultaneous-move games as ones in which players choose their\nstrategies at the same time. This isn\u2019t quite right, however,\nbecause what is of strategic importance is not the temporal\norder of events per se, but whether and when players know\nabout other players\u2019 actions relative to having to choose\ntheir own. For example, if two competing businesses are both planning\nmarketing campaigns, one might commit to its strategy months before\nthe other does; but if neither knows what the other has committed to\nor will commit to when they make their decisions, this is a\nsimultaneous-move game. Chess, by contrast, is normally played as a\nsequential-move game: you see what your opponent has done before\nchoosing your own next action. (Chess can be turned into a\nsimultaneous-move game if the players each call moves on a common\nboard while isolated from one another; but this is a very different\ngame from conventional chess.)\n\nIt was said above that the distinction between sequential-move and\nsimultaneous-move games is not identical to the distinction between\nperfect-information and imperfect-information games. Explaining why\nthis is so is a good way of establishing full understanding of both\nsets of concepts. As simultaneous-move games were characterized in the\nprevious paragraph, it must be true that all simultaneous-move games\nare games of imperfect information. However, some games may contain\nmixes of sequential and simultaneous moves. For example, two firms\nmight commit to their marketing strategies independently and in\nsecrecy from one another, but thereafter engage in pricing competition\nin full view of one another. If the optimal marketing strategies were\npartially or wholly dependent on what was expected to happen in the\nsubsequent pricing game, then the two stages would need to be analyzed\nas a single game, in which a stage of sequential play followed a stage\nof simultaneous play. Whole games that involve mixed stages of this\nsort are games of imperfect information, however temporally staged\nthey might be. Games of perfect information (as the name implies)\ndenote cases where no moves are simultaneous (and where no\nplayer ever forgets what has gone before).\n\nAs previously noted, games of perfect information are the (logically)\nsimplest sorts of games. This is so because in such games (as long as\nthe games are finite, that is, terminate after a known number of\nactions) players and analysts can use a straightforward procedure for\npredicting outcomes. A player in such a game chooses her first action\nby considering each series of responses and counter-responses that\nwill result from each action open to her. She then asks herself which\nof the available final outcomes brings her the highest utility, and\nchooses the action that starts the chain leading to this outcome. This\nprocess is called backward induction (because the reasoning\nworks backwards from eventual outcomes to present choice\nproblems).\n\nThere will be much more to be said about backward induction and its\nproperties in a later section (when we come to discuss equilibrium and\nequilibrium selection). For now, it has been described just so we can\nuse it to introduce one of the two types of mathematical objects used\nto represent games: game trees. A game tree is an example of\nwhat mathematicians call a directed graph. That is, it is a\nset of connected nodes in which the overall graph has a direction. We\ncan draw trees from the top of the page to the bottom, or from left to\nright. In the first case, nodes at the top of the page are interpreted\nas coming earlier in the sequence of actions. In the case of a tree\ndrawn from left to right, leftward nodes are prior in the sequence to\nrightward ones. An unlabelled tree has a structure of the following\nsort:\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nThe point of representing games using trees can best be grasped by\nvisualizing the use of them in supporting backward-induction\nreasoning. Just imagine the player (or analyst) beginning at the end\nof the tree, where outcomes are displayed, and then working backwards\nfrom these, looking for sets of strategies that describe paths leading\nto them. Since a player\u2019s utility function indicates which\noutcomes she prefers to which, we also know which paths she will\nprefer. Of course, not all paths will be possible because the other\nplayer has a role in selecting paths too, and won\u2019t take actions\nthat lead to less preferred outcomes for her. We will present some\nexamples of this interactive path selection, and detailed techniques\nfor reasoning through these examples, after we have described a\nsituation we can use a tree to model.\n\nTrees are used to represent sequential games, because they\nshow the order in which actions are taken by the players. However,\ngames are sometimes represented on matrices rather than\ntrees. This is the second type of mathematical object used to\nrepresent games. Matrices, unlike trees, simply show the outcomes,\nrepresented in terms of the players\u2019 utility functions, for\nevery possible combination of strategies the players might use. For\nexample, it makes sense to display the river-crossing game from\n Section 1\n on a matrix, since in that game both the fugitive and the hunter have\njust one move each, and each chooses their move in ignorance of what\nthe other has decided to do. Here, then, is part of the\nmatrix:\n\n\n\n\nHunter\n\nSafe Bridge\nRocky Bridge\nCobra Bridge\n\nFugitive\nSafe Bridge\n0,1\n1,0\n1,0\n\nRocky Bridge\n?\n0,1\n?\n\nCobra Bridge\n?\n?\n0,1\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nThe fugitive\u2019s three possible strategies\u2014cross at the safe\nbridge, risk the rocks, or risk the cobras\u2014form the rows of the\nmatrix. Similarly, the hunter\u2019s three possible\nstrategies\u2014waiting at the safe bridge, waiting at the rocky\nbridge and waiting at the cobra bridge\u2014form the columns of the\nmatrix. Each cell of the matrix shows\u2014or, rather would\nshow if our matrix was complete\u2014an outcome defined in\nterms of the players\u2019 payoffs. A player\u2019s payoff\nis simply the number assigned by her ordinal utility function to the\nstate of affairs corresponding to the outcome in question. For each\noutcome, Row\u2019s payoff is always listed first, followed by\nColumn\u2019s. Thus, for example, the upper left-hand corner above\nshows that when the fugitive crosses at the safe bridge and the hunter\nis waiting there, the fugitive gets a payoff of 0 and the hunter gets\na payoff of 1. We interpret these by reference to the two\nplayers\u2019 utility functions, which in this game are very simple.\nIf the fugitive gets safely across the river he receives a payoff of\n1; if he doesn\u2019t he gets 0. If the fugitive doesn\u2019t make\nit, either because he\u2019s shot by the hunter or hit by a rock or\nbitten by a cobra, then the hunter gets a payoff of 1 and the fugitive\ngets a payoff of 0.\n\nWe\u2019ll briefly explain the parts of the matrix that have been\nfilled in, and then say why we can\u2019t yet complete the rest.\nWhenever the hunter waits at the bridge chosen by the fugitive, the\nfugitive is shot. These outcomes all deliver the payoff vector (0, 1).\nYou can find them descending diagonally across the matrix above from\nthe upper left-hand corner. Whenever the fugitive chooses the safe\nbridge but the hunter waits at another, the fugitive gets safely\nacross, yielding the payoff vector (1, 0). These two outcomes are\nshown in the second two cells of the top row. All of the other cells\nare marked, for now, with question marks. Why? The problem\nhere is that if the fugitive crosses at either the rocky bridge or the\ncobra bridge, he introduces parametric factors into the game. In these\ncases, he takes on some risk of getting killed, and so producing the\npayoff vector (0, 1), that is independent of anything the hunter does.\nWe don\u2019t yet have enough concepts introduced to be able to show\nhow to represent these outcomes in terms of utility\nfunctions\u2014but by the time we\u2019re finished we will, and this\nwill provide the key to solving our puzzle from\n Section 1.\n\nMatrix games are referred to as \u2018normal-form\u2019 or\n\u2018strategic-form\u2019 games, and games as trees are referred to\nas \u2018extensive-form\u2019 games. The two sorts of games are not\nequivalent, because extensive-form games contain\ninformation\u2014about sequences of play and players\u2019 levels of\ninformation about the game structure\u2014that strategic-form games\ndo not. In general, a strategic-form game could represent any one of\nseveral extensive-form games, so a strategic-form game is best thought\nof as being a set of extensive-form games. When order of play\nis irrelevant to a game\u2019s outcome, then you should study its\nstrategic form, since it\u2019s the whole set you want to know about.\nWhere order of play is relevant, the extensive form\nmust be specified or your conclusions will be unreliable.\n",
