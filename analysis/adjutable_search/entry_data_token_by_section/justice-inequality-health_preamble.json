    "main_text": "\n\nAmong American men, there is a 14.6 year difference in life expectancy\nbetween the top 1% and the bottom 1% of the income distribution\n(Chetty et al. 2016). Among American women, the corresponding\ndifference is 10.1 years. In a recent survey, 38.2% of U.S.\nrespondents in the bottom third of the income distribution reported\nfair or poor health, compared to 21.4% of respondents in the middle\nthird, and 12.3% of respondents in the top third (Hero, Zaslavsky,\n& Blendon 2017). These disparities were reduced but not eliminated\nby adjustment for health insurance status.\n\nAmericans also experience health disparities along racial and ethnic\nlines. In 2019, the life expectancy at birth for Hispanic Americans\nwas 81.8 years, while it was 78.8 years for non-Hispanic white\nAmericans, and 74.7 years for non-Hispanic Black Americans (Arias,\nTejada-Vera, & Ahmad 2021). A recent study estimates that the\nCOVID-19 pandemic disproportionately reduced the life expectancy (at\nbirth) for Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black Americans from 2018 to\n2020: 3.88 years for Hispanic Americans, 3.25 years for non-Hispanic\nBlack Americans, compared to 1.36 years for non-Hispanic white\nAmericans (Woolf, Masters, and Aron 2021).\n\nIf one turns to the international context, significant inequalities in\nlife expectancy can be observed between people in low-income and\nhigh-income countries. In 2016, life expectancy in low-income\ncountries was 62.7 years, compared to 80.8 years in high-income\ncountries, a gap of 18.1 years (WHO 2020).\n\nOn the face of it, these inequalities in life expectancy and\nself-reported health are seriously unjust. But whether the appearances\nof injustice here will withstand close scrutiny is a separate\nquestion. Not all inequalities in life expectancy seem unjust. For\nexample, in 2018, life expectancy for all American women was 81.2\nyears, whereas for all American men it was only 76.2 years (Xu et al.\n2020). Presumably, little (if any) of this 5 year inequality in life\nexpectancy represents an injustice. However, if some inequalities in\nhealth are not unjust, then inequalities in health are not unjust\nper se.\n\nSo what makes a health inequality an injustice, when it is one? Do\nhealth inequalities have some significance in justice that\ndiffers from other important inequalities? Or is the injustice of an\nunjust inequality in health simply due to the application of general\nprinciples of equality and justice to the case of health?\n\nTo answer these questions, one has to examine two rather different\nliteratures. On the one hand, there is an empirical literature\nconcerning the underlying determinants of health; on the other hand,\nthere is a philosophical literature concerned with the ethics of\npopulation health. The former literature is considerably more\nextensive and developed than the latter. Even there, however, the\nanswers on offer are hardly complete or fully established.\n",
