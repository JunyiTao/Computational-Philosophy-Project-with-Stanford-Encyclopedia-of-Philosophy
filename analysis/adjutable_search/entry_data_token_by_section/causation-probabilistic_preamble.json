    "main_text": "\n\n\u201cProbabilistic Causation\u201d designates a group of theories\nthat aim to characterize the relationship between cause and effect\nusing the tools of probability theory. The central idea behind these\ntheories is that causes change the probabilities of their effects.\nThis article traces developments in probabilistic causation, including\nrecent developments in causal modeling.\n\nThis entry surveys the main approaches to characterizing causation in\nterms of probability. Section 1 provides some of the motivation for\nprobabilistic approaches to causation, and addresses a few preliminary\nissues. Section 2 surveys theories that aim to characterize causation\nin terms of probability-raising. Section 3 surveys developments in\ncausal modeling. Section 4 covers probabilistic accounts of actual\ncausation.\n",
