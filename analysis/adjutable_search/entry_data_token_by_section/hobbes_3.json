    "main_text": "Mind and Language || Signification\n2.2 Signification\n\nHobbes\u2019s account of language is crucial for his account of the\nmind, and has important connections to his views in political\nphilosophy (Pettit 2008). Reading Hobbes\u2019s various accounts of\nlanguage, it quickly becomes clear that the notion of signification is\ncentral. It is apparently the central semantic relationship in\nHobbes\u2019s story, playing the sort of role that\u2019s played in\nmore recent accounts by meaning or sense or reference (Abizadeh 2015;\nP\u00e9charman 2004). But what is signification? One important\nquestion here is whether and how Hobbes distinguishes signification\n(and the thing signified) from naming (and the thing named).\n\nWhen Hobbes introduces his story about names in the The Elements\nof Law he tells us that \u201cA NAME or APPELLATION therefore is\nthe voice of a man, arbitrarily imposed, for a mark to bring to his\nmind some conception concerning the thing on which it is imposed.\nThings named are either the objects themselves, as man; or the\nconception itself that we have of man, as shape or motion; or some\nprivation, which is when we conceive that there is something which we\nconceive, not in him\u201d (Hobbes 1640, 5.2\u20133). That is,\nHobbes first introduces names as having a private use for individuals,\nto help them to bring particular ideas to mind. (Hobbes uses\n\u2018name\u2019 in a very broad sense. In that chapter alone, he\ngives \u2018Socrates\u2019, \u2018Homer\u2019, \u2018man\u2019,\n\u2018just\u2019, \u2018valiant\u2019, \u2018strong\u2019,\n\u2018comely\u2019, and \u2018faith\u2019 as example of names.)\nNotice here that though the point of using names is to recall ideas,\nthe thing named is not necessarily an idea. It may well be an external\nobject such as, in Hobbes\u2019s example, a man. Later in that\nchapter, Hobbes starts to talk explicitly about signifying rather than\nnaming. Thus in talking about ambiguity Hobbes says that \u201cthe\nword faith sometimes signifieth the same with belief; sometimes it\nsignifieth particularly that belief which maketh a Christian; and\nsometimes it signifieth the keeping of a promise\u201d (Hobbes 1640,\n5.7). However, it is not at all clear that he really means to\nintroduce signifying as a relation distinct from naming here. Indeed,\nhe seems rather to be giving the same relation two different\nnames.\n\nIn Leviathan and De Corpore something more complex\ngoes on (Duncan 2011). The equivalent chapters in Leviathan\nand De Corpore start in the same way, with discussions of the\nrole of names as marks to aid the memory (Hobbes 1651, 4.3; Hobbes\n1655, 2.1). However, both then go straight on to introduce another\nrole for names, as signs to the hearer of the speaker\u2019s thoughts\n(Hobbes 1651, 4.3; Hobbes 1655, 2.2\u20135). And\n\u2018signify\u2019 appears to be the verb corresponding to what\nsigns do. Though there are hints of this account in\nLeviathan, it is set out in most detail in De\nCorpore. There Hobbes says that names alone are not signs:\n\u201cthey are not signs except insofar as they are arranged in\nspeech and are its parts\u201d (Hobbes 1655, 2.3). So when we talk\nabout signification, it\u2019s the act of signifying, of\ncommunicating one\u2019s thoughts by using words that are a sign of\nthem, that is basic. In other terminology, while words name things,\nit\u2019s utterances that have signification.\n\nSomeone might think that, and nevertheless have a derivative notion of\nwhat a word signifies. Hobbes takes some steps in this direction. In\nparticular, we can understand two words having the same signification\nas their being interchangeable without changing the signification of\nthe utterance (Hungerland and Vick 1981, 68). Thus Hobbes uses\n\u2018signify\u2019 when talking about a translation relation, as\nwhen he says in Leviathan that \u201cthe Greeks call it\nfancy, which signifies appearance\u201d (Hobbes\n1651, 2.2). And some interpreters go further, and take Hobbes to\nbelieve that words signify ideas, which are the ideas they call to\nmind when used in utterances.\n",
