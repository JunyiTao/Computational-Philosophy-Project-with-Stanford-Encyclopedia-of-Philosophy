    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Territory || Self-determination theories\n3.6 Self-determination theories\n\nSelf-determination theories of territory have the same overall shape\nas nationalist theories, but they seek to avoid the difficulties of\nassuming culturally homogeneous nations by ascribing territorial\nrights to a \u2018people\u2019 understood as a politically-organized\nrather than cultural group. Anna Stilz (2019: 10) argues that her\naccount is built on three pillars: a property-like right of occupancy;\nthe value of \u2018basic justice\u2019, conceptualized in Kantian\nterms of the requirements of an \u2018omnilateral will\u2019; and\nthe value of collective self-determination. Margaret Moore (2015: 66)\nappeals to the first and third: that a state holds territorial rights\n(by acting as a vehicle of self-determination\u201d for a group; and\nthat the group must \u201clegitimately occupy\u201d the territory.\nAlthough Moore does not emphasize basic justice as a requirement for\nholding territorial rights (though she claims it is necessary for\nlegitimate governance), she argues that there are functional and\njustice reasons why the state should be organized\nterritorially\u2014to secure equal treatment for all citizens of the\nstate, justice, and the rule of law. Stilz deploys more Kantian\nlanguage, to describe her commitment to justice, but this isn\u2019t\ncentral to her theory of territory, in the sense that it does not help\nto define the boundaries of particular territories, nor does this\nargument contribute to the justification for particular\nterritories.\n\nBoth Moore and Stilz explore the moral relationship between people and\nplace through invoking the idea of what it means for a people to\noccupy a place. The central difference between Moore\u2019s and\nStilz\u2019s accounts are the different accounts of the holders of\noccupancy rights. Both agree that the occupancy right-holder must\noccupy the land legitimately (meaning that it has not displaced\nsomeone else) and it must be rooted in that geographical space by the\nlife-plans and projects of the group\u2019s members. However,\nStilz\u2019s theory describes the holder of occupancy rights as the\nindividual; and Moore disaggregates different \u2018incidents\u2019\nof occupancy rights, so that some are held by individuals (which she\ncalls individual residency rights) and some are held by groups (which\nshe calls a group-based occupancy right). The key element, for Moore,\nin the transition to territorial rights is the group-based occupancy\nright. Both argue that occupancy requires more than physical presence:\nthe individual and/or group must be rooted in that geographical space\nby the individual life-plans, and, for Moore, the collective projects\nof the group\u2019s members.\n\nThere are three important challenges to self-determination theories.\nBoth Stilz and Moore can explain why people should not be expelled or\nrelocated\u2014because it will disrupt their located life plans\u2014but\nneither can offer precise guidelines for boundary\u2013drawing. This\nis because Moore\u2019s group occupancy principle can only identify\nheartlands of groups, but as she concedes, in many cases, this does\nnot draw precise boundaries because often groups overlap on the same\nland. It does not therefore provide an easy solution to border\ndisputes. In many cases, territories cannot be parcelled into discrete\nunits and power-sharing forms of self-determination between groups are\nnecessary in particular areas. Stilz\u2019s theory seems to be even\nless determinate with respect to identifying the location and scope of\nterritorial rights because it\u2019s not clear that individual\nlocated life plans would converge on the same place at all. Although\nStilz uses the case of Navajos as a case of a group that was wrongly\nexpelled, it\u2019s not clear where the individual Navajos are\nentitled to return to, and why their claims are any different from any\nother person, who has plans with respect to a place, and in which,\nindividual variation being as it is, there may or may not be overlap\namong different individual Navajos. \n\nSecond, the emphasis on collective self-determination as the value\nthat territorial rights realize seems to apply most straightforwardly\nto groups that engage in democratic self-determination, because then\nwe can then be confident that the state is the vehicle of the group\nself-determination. If this is so, then, both Moore and Stilz are\nvulnerable to the criticism that is parallel to one that is levelled\nagainst justice theorists, viz., that either the bar to being a\nterritorial right-holder is so high that many states would not meet it\n(which seems somewhat counter-intuitive); or the bar is so low that it\nraises questions whether such an entity could be justified on a\nself-determination argument. Both Moore and Stilz partially avoid the\nmost troubling implication of this as they argue that the appeal to\nself-determination distinguishes between internal and external threats\nto state territorial integrity and that they can thereby explain the\nvalue that is lost by external intervention. \n\nThird, whether self-determination could be realized or not depends on\nwhether the occupancy group (in Moore\u2019s theory) or the aggregate\nindividuals who have occupancy rights (in Stilz\u2019s theory) have\nthe capacity to be the right kind of agent to exercise jurisdiction.\nHowever, the capacity condition is normatively problematic. If we\ndefine capacity broadly, it suggests that any state that is conquered\nor failed lacks capacity and is therefore not an appropriate agent for\nterritorial rights. This is counter-intuitive, because many groups\nlack capacity because they have been denied it through previous\ninjustice. Thus it seems that this condition is too sensitive to power\nconfigurations for a normative theory of territorial rights. Moore\nattempts to avoid this problem by emphasizing that there are\nthird-party duties to refrain from interference and to assist groups\nthat suffer from burdened conditions. However, this strategy could be\ncriticized as being ad hoc, in the sense that it is not based\non a principled definition of what counts as\n\u2018capacity\u2019.\n",
