    "main_text": "Intellectual Creatures\n4. Intellectual Creatures\n\nWhen we arrive at the threshold of intellectual cognition, we are\nentering the next step along the Bonaventurean journey. This level of\ncreaturely being points to the Divine Source, but in ways that are\nmore direct than those in which sensible creatures do. In exercising\ntheir powers of intellect and will, intellectual creatures discover\nthe highest and most perfect object of their powers in the Divine\nSource of their being, since God is the First or Highest Truth and the\nFirst or Chief Good. Accordingly, intellectual creatures have God as\ntheir ultimate object, whereas all creatures have God as their Cause.\nConsequently, intellectual creatures show themselves to be\n\u201cimages\u201d and \u201clikenesses\u201d of God, while they\nshow that all creatures are \u201cshadows\u201d and\n\u201cvestiges\u201d of God.\n\nBonaventure traces out how intellectual creatures and intelligible\nobjects reflect the divine Source. If we begin with something as\nimmediate and basic as simple apprehension on the part of the human\nintellect, we find that an object of simple apprehension (such as the\nnatural kind \u201cdog\u201d) is susceptible of definition. Yet\nevery definition requires a genus and a differentia. Through the\ngeneric term we are led to a further object of simple apprehension,\nusually itself susceptible of definition. If the genus is definable,\nwe may state its definition, but we shall eventually find ourselves\nthrough continuing the process of definition arriving similarly at one\nof the supreme general or Aristotelian categories; if the genus is not\ndefinable, then we have arrived at one of the Aristotelian categories.\nOnce we arrive at a category, we confront an item not susceptible of\nfurther definition, though it admits of description. If the\ncategorical item is an accident, it satisfies the description of an\naccident as \u201cbeing through another;\u201d if we are dealing\nwith substance, then the item we are considering satisfies the\ndescription of substance as \u201cbeing in itself\u201d.\n\nThe resolution of all our items of simple apprehension into the\nconcept of being is metaphysically and epistemologically crucial:\nmetaphysically, it opens up a route of argumentation that leads to the\nexistence of God; epistemologically, such a resolution means that\nbehind all, even the most determinate and specific, conceptions of\nthings lies a transcendental awareness of being that informs all of\nour knowledge. If we take the concept of substance as being in itself,\nwe cannot come to know a particular substance\u2019s definition\nwithout the concept of being presupposed in the background, and in\naddition we are concomitantly aware of the transcendental properties\nof being (unity, truth, and goodness) in any such notion. Such\nco-extensive transcendental properties, however, are only one of the\ntwo types of properties that belong to being; the other transcendental\nproperties (later called disjunctive properties) prove extremely\nuseful for increasing our metaphysical knowledge. Being may be\nconceived of as either actual or potential, absolute or dependent,\nprior or posterior, immutable or mutable. Yet to conceive of being as\npotential, dependent, posterior, or mutable requires that we already\nbe acquainted with being as actual, independent, prior and immutable.\nIn other words, the more perfect of the two disjuncts in any of the\ndisjunctive transcendentals must be an item we acknowledge in our\nawareness of being:\n\n\nSince privations and defects may only be known through positive\nfeatures, our intellect does not fully resolve the understanding of\nany one created thing unless it is assisted by an understanding of the\npurest, most actual, complete, and absolute being, which is being\nsimply and eternally and in which are found all the formulas of things\nin their purity. Indeed, how can the mind know that this being is\ndefective and incomplete unless it has some awareness of being without\ndefect? And the same line of analysis pertains to the other conditions\nof being mentioned above. (Journey cap. III, n. 3 [Quaracchi\nV: 394a]; trans.\n authors)[20]\n\n\nAt one level, this line of argumentation is part of an argument for\nthe existence of God. But, at another level, it is an effort to\ndemarcate the proper object of the human mind as being and to point\nout that, if we reflect upon the notion of being (ens) in\nterms of its actuality (esse) we are inexorably led to the\nconclusion that there is a Perfect Being (Journey cap. V, n.\n3 [Quaracchi V:\n 308b\u2013309a][21]).\n We reach the same kind of conclusion if we reflect, not upon the\nprimary object of the mind, but upon its operations. The certainty of\njudgment requires that we be aware of the impossibility of our being\nmistaken combined with our awareness that the truth that we know\ncannot be otherwise; indeed, the most fundamental truths we know are\nall immutable. But, following Augustine, Bonaventure claims that there\nis no source for immutable truth other than God, since God is the only\nimmutable and unchanging Being Journey cap. III, n. 3\n[Quaracchi V:\n 304a\u2013b][22]).\n\nWhat we find when we look within ourselves is that we are pointed\nabove to God, who is the light of the mind, guaranteeing the certainty\nof our judgments. This thesis, usually called by scholars divine\nillumination, was quite ancient by Bonaventure\u2019s time; it was\npart of the philosophical teaching of Augustine. What makes\nBonaventure\u2019s version so philosophically distinctive is that he\nproposes to synthesize the epistemology of divine illumination with\nthe Aristotelian account of abstraction. Bonaventure is thoroughly\ncommitted to the integral role played by the agent and possible\nintellects in human intellectual cognition. The agent and possible\nintellects are not separated substances, in the way envisaged by\nAverroes, but properly human faculties essential to the constitution\nof the human soul (In II Sent. d. 24, pars 1, art 2, q. 4\n[Quaracchi II:\n 568b][23]).\n Hence, unlike his contemporaries, who often thought of the human\npossible intellect as being illumined by God functioning as an agent\nintellect, Bonaventure assigns each human being an agent intellect.\nDiffering from his contemporaries, Bonaventure also insists that the\npossible intellect always remains the recipient of the intelligible\nspecies abstracted by the agent intellect and the faculty of\napprehension; accordingly, the possible intellect continues to be part\nof the human soul even when the soul is separated by death from the\nbody (In II Sent. d. 24, pars 1 art. 2, q. 4 [Quaracchi II:\n569b\u2013570a]). Abstraction is, for Bonaventure, the main, though\nnot exclusive, source of our concepts of things. How then does\nillumination work and why is it necessary? The divine light works\ntogether with the human intellectual faculties as a \u201cregulative\nand moving cause\u201d, ensuring that the human mind grasps the\nimmutable truth of the creature; it does not and cannot replace the\nhuman intellectual faculties in their proper roles (De scientia\nChristi, q. 4 [Quaracchi V: 23b]). The appeal to divine\nillumination is justified, primarily if not exclusively, for the\nreason that there is an incommensurability between our intellectual\nfaculties and the ordinary objects we know as created and mutable, on\nthe one hand, and the immutable truths we come to know. Inasmuch as\nthings cannot give what they do not have, the only source of eternal\nand immutable truth is God\u2019s Light.\n\nIn general, the activities proper to intellectual creatures point much\nmore directly than merely sensible or sentient creatures to the divine\nSource. Both the objects of the understanding and the will are\nultimately rooted in God as Being and Goodness. This more direct\npointing to God on the part of the intellectual creature is also seen\nin the intellectual creature\u2019s constitution, both psychological\nand ontological. The image of God is found in the fundamental\ninterrelatedness of the memory, understanding, and will. Each act of\nmemory calls to mind the past, is aware of the present and anticipates\nthe future; each act of understanding presupposes the memory of first\nprinciples; and each act of will presupposes the act of understanding\nand moves the mind to further acts of memory. This triadic structure\nof the human mind reflects its Source: the Perfect Being that is\nsimultaneously, Highest Unity, Supreme Truth, and Ultimate Good\n(Itenerarium cap. III, n. 5\u20136 [Quaracchi V:\n305a\u2013b]). Likewise, the ontological constitution of intellectual\ncreatures, humans and angels, moves us along the road to the\nconsideration of God. Each intellectual creature is composed of act\nand potency, metaphysical principles that Bonaventure understands to\nbe co-extensive with matter and form (In II Sent. d. 3 pars\n1, art. 1, q. 2 resp. [Quaracchi II 97b]). Accordingly, even\nintellectual creatures are composed of form and matter (In II\nSent., d. 3, pars 1, art. 1, q. 1 resp. [Quaracchi II: 91a];\nIn II Sent. d. 17, art. 1, q. 2, resp. [Quaracchi II:\n414b\u2013415a]). For Bonaventure, it is the conjunction of form and\nmatter that explains the individuality of each thing (In II\nSent. d. 3, pars 1, art. 2, q. 3 resp. [Quaracchi II:\n109b\u2013110a]; on the principle of individuation in Bonaventure,\nsee King 1994). But that even the highest creatures are composed of\npotency and act in this fashion entails that they are derived from a\nSource that is not so composed, but is, instead, pure act and hence\npure form.\n",
