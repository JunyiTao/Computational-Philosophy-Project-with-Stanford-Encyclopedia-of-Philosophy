    "main_text": "\n\nThe principal aim of research on religious language is to give an\naccount of the meaning of religious sentences and utterances.\nReligious sentences are generally taken to be have a religious subject\nmatter; a religious utterance is the production in speech or writing\nof a token religious sentence. In principle, religious subject matters\ncould encompass a variety of agents, states of affairs or\nproperties\u2014such as God, deities, angels, miracles, redemption,\ngrace, holiness, sinfulness. Most attention, however, has been devoted\nto the meaning of what we say about God.\n\nThe scope of religious language and discourse could be construed more\nwidely. For instance, while The Song of Songs has little in\nthe way of distinctively religious content, it could be included in\nthe field because of its place within a religious canon.\nAlternatively, the field could be characterised pragmatically to\ninclude utterances which are used for religious purposes or in\nreligious contexts (Alston 2005: 220; Donovan 1976: 1; Soskice 1999:\n349; Charlesworth 1974: 3). In practice, however, philosophical\ntreatments have not extended so broadly, instead focusing on sentences\nand utterances with putatively religious content. This is partly\nbecause it is difficult to find a principled characterisation of a\nreligious context that would delineate a philosophically interesting\nscope for the topic. When a church congregation is told \u201cPlease\nkneel\u201d, this direction appears to be in a religious context and\nhave a religious purpose but it is difficult to see how the analysis\nof the meaning of this instruction would informatively contribute to\nthe topic. It is also because the most pressing questions about\nreligious language seem to be those that come into alignment with\nquestions in other areas of philosophy of religion. Is there\nanything distinctive about the meanings of what we say about God and\nother religious matters that are also the focus of metaphysical and\nepistemological discussion? If, in talking about God, speakers are not\nexpressing propositions or not talking literally\u2014to take a\ncouple of the more radical proposals\u2014that would accordingly\nrequire dramatic adjustments in approaching questions about knowledge\nof God or God\u2019s existence.\n\nResearch in the field has a lengthy history, with sustained discussion\nof the meanings of religious expressions and utterances stretching\nback at least to the middle of antiquity. Notable treatments of the\ntopic include the work by medieval theologians and philosophers\nconcerned with the meanings of divine predicates, including the\ndebates surrounding analogy and apophaticism (White 2010; Turner 1995;\nScott & Citron 2016), and debates about the meaningfulness of\nreligious language that were prompted by Ayer\u2019s 1936\npopularisation of logical positivism in Language, Truth and\nLogic and remained a central issue in the philosophy of religion\nthrough the mid-twentieth century. Religious language\nhas also become a topic of interest in continental philosophy (Derrida\n1989 and 1992; Marion 1994 and 1995).\n\nA distinction that guides the selection of material for this article\nis between revisionary and non-revisionary accounts of religious\nlanguage. Non-revisionary theories aim to explain what religious\nsentences and utterances mean. Revisionary theories, in contrast,\npropose accounts of what religious language should mean or how it\nshould be used. While non-revisionary theories are descriptive of\nreligious language and should do justice to linguistic data,\nrevisionary theories are usually driven by metaphysical or\nepistemological considerations. This article will mainly be concerned\nwith theories of the former type i.e., what religious utterances mean\nrather than what they should mean.\n",
