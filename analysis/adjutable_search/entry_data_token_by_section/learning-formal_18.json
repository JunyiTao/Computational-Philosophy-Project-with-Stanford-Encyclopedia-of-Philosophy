Simplicity, Stable Belief, and Ockham\u2019s Razor\n\nA strong intuition about inductive inference and scientific method is\nthat we should prefer simpler hypotheses over complex ones; see the\n entry on simplicity.\n Statisticians, computer scientists, and other researchers concerned\nwith learning from observations have made extensive use of a\npreference for simplicity to solve practical inductive problems\n[Domingos 1999]. From a foundational point of view, simplicity is\nproblematic for at least two reasons.\n\nThe justification problem: Why adopt simple hypotheses? One\nobvious answer is that the world is simple and therefore a complex\ntheory is false. However, the apriori claim that the world is simple\nis highly controversial\u2014see the\n entry on simplicity.\n From a learning-theoretic perspective, dismissing complex hypotheses\nimpairs the reliability of inductive methods. In Kelly\u2019s\nmetaphor, a fixed bias is like a stopped watch: We may happen to use\nthe watch when it is pointing at the right time, but the watch is not\na reliable instrument for telling time [Kelly 2007a, 2010]. \nThe description problem: Epistemologists have worried that\nsimplicity is not an objective feature of a hypothesis, but rather\n\u201cdepends on the mode of presentation\u201d, as Nozick puts it.\nGoodman\u2019s Riddle illustrates this point. If generalizations are\nframed in blue-green terms, \u201call emeralds are green\u201d\nappears simpler than \u201call emeralds are first green and then\nblue\u201d. But in a grue-bleen language, \u201call emeralds are\ngrue\u201d appears simpler than \u201call emeralds are first grue\nand then bleen\u201d. \n\n\nLearning theorists have engaged in recent and ongoing efforts to apply\nmeans-ends epistemology to develop a theory of the connection between\nsimplicity and induction that addresses these concerns [Kelly 2010,\nHarmann and Kulkarni 2007, Luo and Schulte 2006, Steel 2009]. It turns\nout that a fruitful perspective is to examine the relationship between\nthe structure of a hypothesis space and the mind change complexity of\nthe corresponding inductive problem. The fundamental idea is that,\nwhile simplicity does not enjoy an a priori connection with truth,\nchoosing simple hypotheses can help an inquirer find the truth more\nefficiently, in the sense of avoiding mind changes.\nKelly\u2019s road metaphor illustrates the idea. Consider two routes\nto the destination, one via a straight highway, the other via back\nroads. Both routes eventually lead to the same point, but the back\nroads entail more twists and turns [Kelly 2007a, 2010].\n\nA formalization of this idea takes the form of an Ockham\nTheorem: A theorem that shows (under appropriate restrictions)\nthat an inductive method finds the truth as efficiently as possible\nfor a given problem if and only if the method is the Ockham\nmethod, that is, it selects the simplest hypothesis consistent\nwith the data. An Ockham theorem provides a justification for\nOckham\u2019s inductive razor as a means towards epistemic aims.\n\nWhether an Ockham theorem is true depends on the description of the\nOckham method, that is, on the exact definition of simplicity for a\nset of hypotheses. There is a body of mathematical results that\nestablish Ockham theorems using a language-invariant simplicity\nmeasure, which we explain next.\n",
