History and Exemplars\n\nAlthough Immanuel Kant rarely uses the term \u2018transcendental\nargument\u2019, and when he does it is not in our current sense (cf.\nHookway 1999: 180 n. 8; cf. Austin 1961), he nonetheless speaks\nfrequently of \u2018transcendental deductions\u2019,\n\u2018transcendental expositions\u2019, and \u2018transcendental\nproofs\u2019, which roughly speaking have the force of what is today\nmeant by \u2018transcendental argument\u2019. Prior exemplars of\nsuch arguments may perhaps be claimed, such as Aristotle\u2019s proof\nof the principle of non-contradiction (see Metaphysics\n1005b35\u20131006a28; Illies 2003: 45\u20136, Walker 2006: 240 and\n255\u20136); but Kant nonetheless formulated what are generally taken\nto be the central examples of such arguments, so the history of the\ntopic is usually assumed to start here, with the Critique of Pure\nReason and its Transcendental Deduction of the Categories, Second\nAnalogy, and Refutation of Idealism. Briefly put, the Deduction is\ndirected against Humean scepticism concerning the applicability of\na priori concepts to our experience; the Second Analogy\nconcerns Humean doubts over causal powers or forces; while the\nRefutation of Idealism focuses on Cartesian (methodological) doubts\nconcerning the existence of the external world.\n\nPerhaps because of its brevity and relative clarity, but also perhaps\nbecause of the hope it can be made \u2018self-standing\u2019 and\nindependent of the (to some) disreputable machinery of transcendental\nidealism [see \u00a73 of the entry on\n Immanuel Kant],\n it is the Refutation that has become the paradigm to many of a\ntranscendental argument. While the wisdom of this can be questioned\n(cf. Bell 1999, where the Refutation is called \u2018a mistaken\nparadigm\u2019), the Refutation undoubtedly makes a useful place for\nus to start.\n\nAs presented by Kant, the Refutation is aimed at the\n\u2018problematic idealism of Descartes\u2019, who holds that the\nexistence of objects outside us in space is \u2018doubtful and\nindemonstrable\u2019 (Kant 1781/1787 B274)\u2014where, as Kant\nfamously remarks in the Preface to the second edition of the\nCritique in which he comments on the Refutation, \u2018it\nalways remains a scandal of philosophy and universal human reason that\nthe existence of things outside us (from which we after all get the\nwhole matter for our cognitions, even for our inner sense) should have\nto be assumed merely on faith, and that if it occurs to\nanyone to doubt it, we should be unable to answer him with a\nsatisfactory proof\u2019 (Kant 1781/1787 Bxxxix note). Kant\u2019s\nstrategy in response then sets the canonical pattern for a\ntranscendental argument, in beginning from what the sceptic takes for\ngranted, namely that we have mental states which we experience as\nhaving a temporal order, and then arguing for the transcendental claim\nthat experience of this sort would not be possible unless we also had\ngenerally veridical experience of things in space outside us, and thus\nknowledge of the external world. In more detail, the argument can be\npresented as follows (cf. Kant 1781/1787 B275\u201379 and\nBxxxix\u2013xli note):\n\n(1) You are aware of\nyour inner mental states (thoughts and sensations) as having a\ntemporal order (e.g., that the sensation of pain you are having now\nwas preceded in time by a feeling of pleasure).\n(2) To be aware of your\nmental states as having a temporal order, you must be aware of\nsomething that existed from the time of your previous mental state to\nthe present.\n(3) For that awareness\nof permanence to be possible, it is not sufficient to have awareness\nof your self (because no permanent self is revealed to us in inner\nsense, as Hume argued: see Hume 1739\u201340: 252) or to have\nimpressions or representations (because these impressions have a\n\u2018perishing existence\u2019, as Hume also argued: see Hume\n1739\u201340: 194).\n\n\nTherefore\n\n(4) The\n\u2018permanent\u2019 of which you are aware must be something that\nis neither you qua subject nor your subjective impressions\nbut must be something distinct from both of these, that is, an object\noutside you in the external world.\n\n\nTherefore\n\n(5) Your awareness of\nthe external world cannot come from a prior awareness of your\nsubjective impressions because the latter awareness is not possible\nwithout the former, and so awareness of the external world cannot be\nbased on the imagination but rather comes from generally veridical\nexperiences.\n\n\nIn this way, Kant hoped to \u2018turn the game played by idealism\nagainst itself\u2019 (cf. B276), by working from the inner experience\nthat it takes for granted and showing that this depends on an outer\nexperience which the idealist doubts, so that in this manner the\n\u2018scandal to philosophy\u2019 posed by such doubts can finally\nbe resolved.\n\nHowever, despite its brevity, the Refutation has given rise to\nconsiderable dispute and discussion, not only because questions can be\nraised about the details of the argument, but also because\nKant\u2019s wider theoretical commitments to transcendental idealism\nhave also rendered the Refutation problematic and his intentions\nunclear: for example, doesn\u2019t the argument undermine\nKant\u2019s own idealism in some way, and how does the\nRefutation relate to the somewhat similar argument in the Fourth\nParalogism of the first edition of the Critique\n(A366\u201380), but in which an appeal to transcendental idealism\nplays a greater role? These complications have led to a range of\ndisputes concerning the Refutation, from whether or not it can be made\ncogent, to whether or not it fits within Kant\u2019s own\nphilosophical project, and indeed whether focusing on this as\nKant\u2019s response to scepticism distorts his conception of\nscepticism, and how he thought it should be resolved. (For further\ndiscussion of the Refutation, see Guyer 1987: 279\u2013332, Caranti\n2007, Dicker 2008.)\n\nTranscendental arguments found a place in philosophy after Kant,\nincluding in the post-Kantian German idealist tradition (cf. Franks\n1999, Franks 2005: 201\u201359, Taylor 1976, Beiser 2005:\n174\u201391, Rockmore & Breazeale 2014, Nance 2015, Tse 2020,\nSch\u00fcz 2022; but for some critical discussion of Taylor see Stern\n2013 and Houlgate 2015, and of Beiser see Stern 2012). However, their\nprominence in more contemporary analytic philosophy is largely due to\nthe work of P. F. Strawson, and particularly his earlier books\nIndividuals and The Bounds of Sense\u2014the latter\nof which is a commentary on Kant\u2019s Critique, while the\nformer is written under its influence in a broader way (cf. Grundmann\n1994; Niquet 1991; Callanan 2011). One example from these works is the\n\u2018objectivity argument\u2019 to be found in The Bounds of\nSense, which aims to show that \u2018[u]nity of diverse\nexperiences in a single consciousness requires experience of\nobjects\u2019; the argument may be outlined as follows (see Strawson\n1966: 97\u2013112, esp. 108; also see Cassam 1997, Cheng 2021a):\n\n(1) Being\nself-conscious is a matter of being able to ascribe diverse\nexperiences to oneself, while being conscious of the unity of that to\nwhich they are ascribed.\n(2) To be in a position\nto think of experiences as one\u2019s own, one must be able\nto think of them as experiences.\n(3) For experience to\nbe such as to provide room for thought of experience itself, it must\nprovide room for a distinction between \u2018This is how things\nare\u2019 and \u2018This is how things are experienced as\nbeing\u2019.\n(4) Only experience of\nobjects that are subject-independent could provide room for this\nis/seems distinction.\n\n\nTherefore\n\n(5) Subject-independent objects exist.\n\n\nIn this way, Strawson hoped to capture what he took to be the central\ncore of Kant\u2019s position, but without appeal to the\n\u2018doctrines of transcendental psychology\u2019 (Strawson 1966:\n97), which he found to be problematic. Likewise, in\nIndividuals, Strawson presented an argument starting from the\npremise that we think of the world as containing objective particulars\nin a single spatiotemporal system, to the conclusion that objects\ncontinue to exist unperceived, where the latter is said to be required\nin order to make possible the kind of identification and\nre-identification necessary for the former (cf. Strawson 1959:\n31\u201358). Thus, as Strawson famously put it, the sceptic\n\u2018pretends to accept a conceptual scheme\u2019 of a world\ncontaining objects in a spatio-temporal system, \u2018but at the same\ntime quietly rejects one of the conditions of its employment\u2019\n(Strawson 1959: 35).\n\nOn the basis of the promise of arguments of this sort from Strawson,\nand from others (such as Shoemaker 1963: 168\u20139), together with\ngrowing interest in the work of Kant himself within analytic\nphilosophy, this period of the late 1950s and early 1960s was a\nsignificant one for the history of transcendental arguments, leading\nto much subsequent discussion. At the same time, central\nWittgensteinian doctrines prominent at the time (such as the notion of\n\u2018criteria\u2019: see \u00a71.3 of the entry on\n other minds)\n were also given a transcendental inflection, so certain\nWittgensteinian claims came to take on the form of transcendental\narguments (cf. Rorty 1971: 3, where he comments that \u2018Many\nadmirers of Wittgenstein\u2019s Philosophical Investigations\nand of Strawson\u2019s Individuals have taken the theme of\nboth books to be an analysis of philosophical skepticism and their\ndistinctive contribution to be a new way of criticizing the\nskeptic\u2019). However, crucial to the debates of the period were\nalso a number of critical articles pointing to the perceived\nlimitation of the transcendental approach, including those by Stefan\nK\u00f6rner (K\u00f6rner 1966, 1967, 1969) and by Barry Stroud (Stroud\n1968), where the latter in particular shaped the ensuing discussion\nover the value of transcendental arguments and what they could be\nexpected to achieve, as we shall see in\n section 3.\n\nNonetheless, while the intervention by Stroud and others led to doubts\nabout the value of transcendental arguments, as theorists asked if\nthese critiques held good and if so what might remain of the\ntranscendental approach, this did not deter prominent philosophers\ncontinuing to produce transcendental arguments. Two of these may serve\nas further exemplars of the genre, where both have gone on to be much\ndiscussed. The first was offered by Hilary Putnam in relation to\nexternal world skepticism once again, and the second by Donald\nDavidson, this time relating more directly to the problem of other\nminds.\n\nPutnam\u2019s argument comes in Chapter 1 of Reason, Truth and\nHistory, where his goal is to refute a modern-day version of\nDescartes\u2019 evil demon hypothesis, according to which I do not\ninhabit a world containing ordinary physical objects (trees, tables,\nhouses), but I am a brain in a vat in a lab whose experiences are\ncaused by a computer artificially stimulating my nerve endings, so\nthat none of these objects actually exist beyond my hallucinatory\nimpression of them (see the entries on Brains in a Vat and\nSkepticism and Content Externalism). This is the brain-in-a-vat\nhypothesis, and it stands for the possibility that, for all I know,\nnothing rules out the world being very different from how it appears\nto me to be, given the gap that exists between appearance (our\nexperience of it) and reality.\n\nNow, Putnam\u2019s response to the sceptic is to argue that though we\ncannot rule out the possibility that we are brains-in-vats on the\ngrounds of how things appear to us, we can rule it out nonetheless.\nHow? Here is one reconstruction of the reasoning: we can rule it out\nbecause on a plausible theory of reference, it is self-refuting: that\nis, \u2018I am a brain-in-a-vat [or BIV, for short]\u2019 cannot be\ntruly affirmed by anyone. The theory of reference Putnam uses as a\npremise is a causal one, which states that \u2018one cannot refer to\ncertain kinds of things, e.g., trees, if one has no causal\ninteraction at all with them, or with things in terms of which they\ncan be described\u2019 (Putnam 1981: 16\u201317). Putnam defends\nthis theory, on the grounds that it alone can explain how reference\noccurs in a way that is not \u2018magical\u2019, i.e., which does\nnot assume that the connection is just somehow intrinsic between\nrepresentations and their referents. It then follows, according to\nPutnam, that a BIV affirming \u2018I am a BIV\u2019 is saying\nsomething true only if the BIV is in what the BIV is calling a\n\u2018vat\u2019. But the BIV is not in one of those; rather, he is\nin a real vat. What he is calling a \u2018vat\u2019 is that\nto which his use of that term causally connects in a referential\nway\u2014where for a BIV, that is something in the computer that\nprompts his applications of \u2018vat\u2019 by giving him\nhallucinations of the appearance of vats. Yet the BIV is not in that\npart of the computer. Thus, Putnam concludes, \u2018I am a BIV\u2019\ncannot be truly asserted by anyone, much like \u2018I do not\nexist\u2019 or \u2018I cannot construct a meaningful sentence\u2019\n(cf. Bardon 2005). It therefore cannot ever be wrong to assert that\none is not a BIV, so that in this sense \u2018I am not a BIV\u2019\nis an incorrigible claim (cf. Putnam 1981: 14\u201315). Putnam\ntherefore holds that we can rule out the BIV hypothesis on a\npriori grounds, and thus refute the sceptic.\n\nPutnam is keen to emphasise the transcendental nature of his\nenterprise in this respect. He stresses that the kinds of constraints\non reference that operate here and disprove the BIV hypothesis are not\nphysical or merely analytic, but involve limitations on what is\npossible that can be arrived at through philosophical reflection on\nthe nature of representation and meaning, and hence fit into a broadly\nKantian model of how to respond to scepticism, albeit with more\nempirical elements:\n\nWhat we have been doing is considering the preconditions for\nthinking about, representing, referring to, etc. We have\ninvestigated these preconditions not by investigating the\nmeaning of these words and phrases (as a linguist might, for example)\nbut by reasoning a priori. Not in the old\n\u2018absolute\u2019 sense (since we do not claim that magical\ntheories of reference are a priori wrong), but in the sense\nof inquiring into what is reasonably possible\nassuming certain general premisses, or making certain very\nbroad theoretical assumptions. Such a procedure is neither\n\u2018empirical\u2019 nor quite \u2018a priori\u2019, but has\nelements of both ways of investigating. In spite of the fallibility of\nmy procedure, and its dependence upon assumptions which might be\ndescribed as \u2018empirical\u2019 (e.g., the assumption that the\nmind has no access to external things or properties apart from that\nprovided by the senses), my procedure has a close relation to what\nKant called a \u2018transcendental\u2019 investigation; for it is an\ninvestigation, I repeat, of the preconditions of reference\nand hence of thought\u2014preconditions built in to the nature of our\nminds themselves, though not (as Kant hoped) wholly independent of\nempirical assumptions. (Putnam 1981: 16)\n\n\nAs a result of his attempt to respond to external world scepticism in\nthis way, Putnam has had an important influence in reviving interest\nin the possibility of using transcendental arguments against\nscepticism. (For further discussion of Putnam\u2019s position, see\nBrueckner 1986, Coppock 1987, Heil 1987, David 1991, Brueckner 1992,\nCaranti 2007: 110\u201313.)\n\nFinally, we may turn to the work of Donald Davidson, who like Putnam\nbases his transcendental claim on a form of externalism, which links\nthe content of our mental states to how we relate to our environment;\nbut in his case, this idea is directed against scepticism concerning\nother minds. Thus, while the sceptic holds that the existence of such\nminds is doubtful, Davidson argues that it would not be possible for a\ncreature like me to have thoughts unless I lived in a world with other\ncreatures who also had thoughts, so the truth of the latter can be\ndeduced from the fact that I am indeed capable of thinking:\n\u2018What are the conditions necessary for the existence of thought,\nand so in particular for the existence of people with thoughts? I\nbelieve there could not be thoughts in one mind if there were no other\nthoughtful creatures with which the first mind shared a natural\nworld\u2019 (Davidson 1989: 193; note that he uses\n\u2018existence,\u2019 not \u2018possibility\u2019). On one\ninterpretation, Davidson\u2019s transcendental argument is based on\nhis account of what it takes for a thought to have content, for which\nhe argues that a process of \u2018triangulation\u2019 must occur,\nwhereby the content of the thought someone is having is\n\u2018fixed\u2019 by the way in which someone else correlates the\nresponses he makes to something in the world. Thus, Davidson argues,\nif there were no other people, the content of our thoughts would be\ntotally indeterminate, and we would in effect have no thoughts at all;\nfrom the self-evident falsity of the latter, he therefore deduces the\nfalsity of the former (cf. Davidson 1991: 159\u201360). Davidson\ntherefore argues that the mistake the sceptic makes, in common with\nthe Cartesian heritage of which he is part, is in the assumption that\nit is possible to be a lone thinker: Davidson\u2019s\ntranscendental argument is designed to show that this is not in fact\nthe case, given the constraints on what it takes to have thoughts with\ncontent, so that the existence of a single thinking subject entails\nthe existence of others.\n\nAs Davidson suggests (cf. Davidson 1991: 157), his position here might\nbe said to have certain similarities to that put forward in\nWittgenstein\u2019s Private Language Argument, at least under the\ninterpretation given by Kripke (see Kripke 1982). Kripke takes\nWittgenstein as arguing that it is impossible to make sense of what it\nis to follow a rule correctly, unless this means that what one is\ndoing is following the practice of others who are like-minded: what\nmakes our continuation of some addition rule a case of rule-following\nat all (for example), is that the community goes on in the same way;\nand, unless addition were rule-governed as a practice, statements like\n\u20182+2=4\u2019 could have no meaning. Thus, from the fact that we\nare able to make such statements meaningfully, the existence of a\ncommunity of others that \u2018fix\u2019 this rule can be inferred,\nas a necessary pre-condition for the former (cf. Kripke 1982: 89). On\nthis view, then, unless the sceptic is prepared to admit the existence\nof this community of fellow-speakers, and thus attribute a capacity\nfor intentional rule-following to those around him, he cannot make\nsense of the idea of meaningful thought in his own case.\n\nWe have therefore seen that taking their inspiration from Kant to a\ngreater or lesser degree, philosophers have come to develop a range of\ntranscendental arguments that are intended to refute scepticism in a\nrobust and ambitious manner, by establishing anti-sceptical\nconclusions on the basis of transcendental claims. From these\nexemplars and others, therefore, we may now say something further\nabout how such arguments work and what makes them distinctive.\n",
