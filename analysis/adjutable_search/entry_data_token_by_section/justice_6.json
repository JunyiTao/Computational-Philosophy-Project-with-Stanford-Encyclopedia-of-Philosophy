    "main_text": "Justice: Four Distinctions || Conservative versus Ideal Justice\n2.1 Conservative versus Ideal Justice\n\nPhilosophers writing on justice have observed that it has two\ndifferent faces, one conservative of existing norms and practices, the\nother demanding reform of these norms and practices (see Sidgwick\n1874/1907, Raphael 2001). Thus on the one hand it is a matter of\njustice to respect people\u2019s rights under existing law or moral\nrules, or more generally to fulfil the legitimate expectations they\nhave acquired as a result of past practice, social conventions, and so\nforth; on the other hand, justice often gives us reason to change\nlaws, practices and conventions quite radically, thereby creating new\nentitlements and expectations. This exposes an ambiguity in what it\nmeans to \u2018render each his due\u2019. What is \u2018due\u2019\nmight be what a person can reasonably expect to have given existing\nlaw, policy, or social practice, or it might be what the person should\nget under a regime of ideal justice: this could mean what the person\ndeserves, or needs, or is entitled to on grounds of equality,\ndepending on which ideal principle is being invoked.\n\nConceptions of justice vary according to the weight they attach to\neach of these faces. At one extreme, some conceptions interpret\njustice as wholly concerned with what individuals can claim under\nexisting laws and social conventions: thus for Hume, justice was to be\nunderstood as adherence to a set of rules that assign physical objects\nto individuals (such as being the first possessor of such an object)\n(Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, Book III, Part II). These\nrules can be explained by reference to the natural associations that\nform in people\u2019s minds between persons and external objects, and\nalthough the system of justice as a whole can be shown to be socially\nuseful, there are no relevant independent standards by which its\nprinciples can be assessed (Hume briskly dismissed equality\nand merit as principles for allocating property to persons).\nIn similar vein, Hayek argued that justice was a property of\nindividual behaviour, understood as compliance with the \u2018rules\nof just conduct\u2019 that had evolved to enable a market economy to\nfunction effectively. For Hayek, to speak of \u2018social\njustice\u2019 as an ideal standard of distribution was as meaningless\nas to speak of a \u2018moral stone\u2019 (Hayek 1976, p. 78)\n\nAt the other extreme stand conceptions of justice which posit some\nideal principle of distribution such as equality, together with a\n\u2018currency\u2019 specifying the respect in which justice\nrequires people to be made equally well off, and then refuse to\nacknowledge the justice of any claims that do not arise directly from\nthe application of this principle. Thus claims deriving from existing\nlaw or practice are dismissed unless they happen to coincide with what\nthe principle requires. More often, however, ideal justice is seen as\nproposing principles by which existing institutions and practices can\nbe assessed, with a view to reforming them, or in the extreme case\nabolishing them entirely, while the claims that people already have\nunder those practices are given some weight. Rawls, for example, whose\ntwo principles of justice count as ideal principles for this purpose,\nis at pains to stress that they are not intended to be applied in a\nway that disregards people\u2019s existing legitimate expectations.\nAbout the \u2018difference principle\u2019, which requires social\nand economic inequalities to be regulated so that they work to the\ngreatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society, he\nsays:\n\nIt applies to the announced system of public law and statutes and not\nto particular transactions or distributions, nor to the decisions of\nindividuals and associations, but rather to the institutional\nbackground against which these transactions and decisions take place.\nThere are no unannounced and unpredictable interferences with\ncitizens\u2019 expectations and acquisitions. Entitlements are earned\nand honored as the public system of rules declares. (Rawls 1993, p.\n283)\n\nHere we see Rawls attempting to reconcile the demands of conservative\nand ideal justice. Yet he does not directly address the question of\nwhat should happen when changing circumstances mean that the\ndifference principle requires new laws or policies to be enacted: do\nthose whose prior entitlements or expectations are no longer met have\na claim to be compensated for their loss? We could call this the\nquestion of transitional justice (though this phrase is often used now\nin a more specific sense to refer to the process of reconciliation\nthat may occur following civil war or other armed conflicts: see the\nentry on\n transitional justice).\n",
