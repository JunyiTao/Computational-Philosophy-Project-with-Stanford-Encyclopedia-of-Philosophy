Conclusion\n\n\nThe Theaetetus is an extended attack on certain assumptions\nand intuitions about knowledge that the intelligent\nman-in-the-street\u2014Theaetetus, for instance\u2014might find\ninitially attractive, and which some philosophers known to\nPlato\u2014Protagoras and Heracleitus, for instance\u2014had worked\nup into complex and sophisticated philosophical theories. Basic to all\nthese assumptions and intuitions, which here have been grouped together under\nthe name \u201cempiricism,\u201d is the idea that knowledge is\nconstructed out of perception and perception alone.\n\n\nThe first part of the Theaetetus attacks the idea that\nknowledge could be simply identified with perception.\nPerceptions alone have no semantic structure. So if this thesis was\ntrue, it would be impossible to state it.\n\n\nThe second part attacks the suggestion that knowledge can be defined\nas true belief, where beliefs are supposed to be\nsemantically-structured concatenations of sensory impressions. Against\nthis Plato argues that, unless something can be said to explain\nhow impressions can be concatenated so as to give them\nsemantic structure, there is no reason to grant that the distinction\nbetween true and false applies to such beliefs any more than it does\nto perceptions.\n\n\nFinally, in the third part of the Theaetetus, an attempt is\nmade to meet this challenge, and present some explanation of how\nsemantic structures can arise out of mere perceptions or impressions.\nThe proposed explanation is the Dream Theory, a theory interestingly\ncomparable to Russellian Logical Atomism, which takes both\npropositions and objects to be complexes \u201clogically\nconstructed\u201d out of simple sensory impressions. On this\nconception, knowledge will come about when someone is capable not only\nof using such logical constructions in thought, but of understanding\nhow they arise from perception.\n\n\nSocrates\u2019 basic objection to this theory is that it still gives no\nproper explanation of how this logical construction takes\nplace. Without such an explanation, there is no good reason to treat\nthe complexes that are thus logically constructed as anything other\nthan simples in their own right. We need to know how it can be that,\nmerely by conjoining perceptions in the right way, we manage to\nachieve a degree of semantic structure that (for instance) makes it\npossible to refer to things in the world, such as\nTheaetetus. But this is not explained simply by listing all the simple\nperceptions that are so conjoined. Nor\u2014and this is where we\nreach the third proposal of 208b11\u2013210a9\u2014is it explained by\nfixing on any of those perceptions in particular, and taking it to be\nthe special mark of Theaetetus whereby reference to Theaetetus is\nfixed.\n\n\nThe third proposal about how to understand logos faces the\ndifficulty that, if it adds anything at all to differentiate knowledge\nof O from true belief about O, then what it adds is\na diagnostic quality of O. If there is a problem about how to\nidentify O, there is a problem about how to identify the\ndiagnostic quality too. This launches a vicious regress.\n\n\nOne way of preventing this regress is to argue that the regress is\ncaused by the attempt to work up a definition of knowledge exclusively out of\nempiricist materials. Hence there is no way of avoiding such a vicious\nregress if you are determined to try to define knowledge on an exclusively\nempiricist basis. The right response is to abandon that attempt.\nKnowledge is indeed indefinable in empiricist terms. In those\nterms, it has no logos. In those terms, therefore,\nknowledge itself is unknowable.\n\n\nThe official conclusion of the Theaetetus is that we still do\nnot know how to define knowledge. Even on the most sceptical reading,\nthis is not to say that we have not learned anything about what\nknowledge is like. As Theaetetus says (210b6), he has given birth to\nfar more than he had in him.\n\n\nAnd as many interpreters have seen, there may be much more to the\nending than that. It may even be that, in the last two pages of the\nTheaetetus, we have seen hints of Plato\u2019s own answer to the\npuzzle. Perhaps understanding has emerged from the last\ndiscussion, as wisdom did from 145d\u2013e, as the key ingredient\nwithout which no true beliefs alone can even begin to look like they\nmight count as knowledge. Perhaps it is only when we, the readers,\nunderstand this point\u2014that epistemological success in the last\nresort depends on having epistemological virtue\u2014that we begin\nnot only to have true beliefs about what knowledge is, but to\nunderstand knowledge. \n",
