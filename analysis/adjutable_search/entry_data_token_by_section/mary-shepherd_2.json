    "main_text": "Doctrine of Cause and Effect || Similar causes must have similar effects\n2.2 Similar causes must have similar effects\n\nShepherd propounds a second causal maxim which we can call the\n\u201cCausal Similarity Principle\u201d (hereafter\n\u201cCSP\u201d): similar causes must have similar effects (ERCE\n[2000: 43\u20139, 53\u20135]). Some scholars assume CSP and CP are\non an epistemic par, both known a priori on the basis of nothing but\nShepherd\u2019s concept of causality (LoLordo 2019: 11; Bolton 2019:\n149). This has prompted the objection that CSP does not solve\nHume\u2019s epistemic problem. He asks for the necessary connection\nbetween things such as smoke and fire which have been regularly\nconjoined in experience: what entitles us to infer other cases will be\nthe same? To reply that CSP is a general conceptual truth is\nempty\u2014as if to say, otherwise the instances in question would\nnot be the same (see Ott 2011, quoted and glossed by LoLordo 2019).\nThere seems to be a disqualifying objection to this: CSP is not an a\npriori truth based on nothing but concepts. It is derived from CP but\nin conjunction with an a posteriori premise with existential\nimport.\n\nBefore we look at this, it is worth mention that Tanner (2022)\nsuggests that although Shepherd\u2019s causal metaphysics implies that\nnature is uniform, i.e. things in the same kind must have similar\neffects, in the absence of a reason to believe the metaphysical\ntheory, she offers nothing that answers Hume\u2019s demand to be shown a\nreason to believe the similarity thesis.This weakness is overcome,\nTanner suggests, if the causal metaphysics is conjoined with a\nprinciple of parsimony that governs the number of natural kinds we\nshould recognize, The conjunction is not the sort of reason Hume has\nin view, but it is a rational justification for belief of the\nsimilarity thesis. This may be true, but there is textual evidence\nthat the causal principles themselves are epistemically founded on\nperceptual knowledge of the world (see below in this section and the\nnext).. The argument for CSP is made in several ways, but all of\nthem have two parts. One reviews the circumstances in which we come to\nbelieve there is a particular cause when observing that a quality\nbegins to exist. This introduces a premise with modal and referential\nfeatures that set her account of causal beliefs apart from\nHume\u2019s. The second part offers Shepherd\u2019s reflection on an\nobject similar to one we believe to cause a certain quality to begin\nits existence: if the two are in similar circumstance, what effects\ncan the duplicate have in view of CP? The upshot is that the\nderivation of CSP has a premise that limits its scope to objects that\nexist,\n\n\nOne derivation of CSP argues, contra Hume, that when we first\nperceive some kind of thing, we may very well discover something about\nits cause by \u201creasoning on an experiment\u201d (ERCE [2000:\n45]). When we are aware that some quality begins to exist and believe\nit has a particular cause, we typically observe qualities of objects\nthat are present shortly before it appears. In favorable\ncircumstances, there are two and only two discernible objects which\ncoalesce at the moment the new quality begins to exist. For example,\nif you pour vinegar into milk and see that it immediately breaks into\ncurds and whey, you are likely to believe the mixture of the two was\nthe cause of newly curdled\n milk.[2]\n The second part of the derivation is a reflection on two similar\nliquids mixed in the same way. Shepherd argues that if the second did\nnot have the same effect as the first, then either something caused an\nalteration in the second, so they are not the same, or it caused an\nalteration in itself, which is impossible according to CP (ERCE [2000:\n45, 46, 48\u20139]). We should ask why this matters given that the\nproposition just asserted is circular and without extensional\nimport.\n\nIn another derivation of CSP, the first part invokes definitions that\naccrue to particular objects that we believe to cause specific\neffects: \u201cIf then an existence now in being, conjoined with any\nother, forms thereby a new nature, capable of exhibiting new\nqualities, these new qualities must enter into the definition of the\nobjects; they become part of their natures\u201d (ERCE [2000: 47]).\nCompiled from the experiences that inform us of the existence of\nparticular causes, such definitions report the sensible qualities and\nother circumstances observed just prior to the novel appearance of one\nor more qualities and record the observed effects of the newly formed\nobject. Provided the antecedently observed sensible qualities are\nprobable indicators of the kinds of previously existing objects\nfrom which the new object results, a definition specifies two markers\nof the kind to which the new object belongs. We can call on them in\ncollecting evidence that two objects are similar and predicting their\neffects under various circumstances. This is the case whether or\nnot any of the antecedent natures (powers) are included in the\nconstitution of the newly formed nature (see ERCE [2000: 189]). So the\ndefinition of an object purports to pick out all and only objects that\nare exactly alike in respect of the powers they amass. (To be clear,\nthe subjects of definitions are particular objects; the definition of\na particular object is the definition of the natural kind to which it\nbelongs if kinds are individuated by causal powers; see section 2.1,\nFantl 2016),)\n\nThat CSP is made true by the constituents of actual objects is also\nshown by the reflection that completes this derivation. Shepherd\nargues that elicited objects are determined as composites: e.g. when a\nfire is elicited from the juncture of two other objects, the\n\u201ccombined qualities\u201d that begin to exist are \u201cthe\nwhole qualities that fire, in every circumstance is capable of\nproducing\u201d (ERCE [2000: 49,\n 54]).[3]\n The truth of CSP is founded on the doctrine that the method of its\nformation fixes the constitution of the resulting object, so similar\nformative origins determine similar constitutions. Rounding the\nderivation out: so on another occasion, the same pre-conditions are\n\u201cnecessarily compelled\u201d to be attended with the same\neffects, or combined qualities: otherwise there would be the\n\u201cbeginnings of existence by themselves\u201d (ERCE [2000 49,\n47\u201348, 52\u201355]). Although the circular maxim has a part\nhere, it is not what makes CSP true.\n\nDefinitions of objects are used to rebuff Hume\u2019s contention that\nthe course of nature can change spontaneously, without a cause that\nalters it. She argues against his examples. He claims it is possible\nthat a body otherwise like snow should burn the skin and taste salty;\nagain, fruit trees that have regularly borne fruit in warm weather may\nsomeday be productive in freezing cold. Shepherd counters that\nalthough the stuff otherwise like snow may well be possible, it would\nnot be snow; rather than marking a change in natures\u2019 course, it\nwould be a different object with qualities arising from different\ncircumstances depending on nature\u2019s course. Again, \u201conce\nthe proof has been afforded\u201d that the nature of fruit trees\nrequires warmth if they are to grow and flower, it must be considered\nimpossible for them to have qualities \u201cnot originally in their\nnatures\u201d (ERCE [2000; 81]).\n\nAt bottom, Shepherd\u2019s causal metaphysics rests on the intuition\nthat the formation of an object renders it what it is. It applies also\nin mathematics (EPEU [2020:: 279]). Shepherd takes mathematical\nobjects to be particular things constructed by placing physical items\nin spatial relations or relations understood to be arithmetical. Their\nproperties are known by inspection, comparison, and the like:\n\u201cmy whole notion of the relation of cause and effect is aptly\nimagined by the nature of the necessary results, included in the\njuxtaposition of quantities\u201d (EPEU [2020: 282]). Shepherd holds\nthat the general truths of natural science for which we have empirical\nevidence are necessary and the necessary truths of arithmetic and\ngeometry are believed partly on the basis of experience (Bolton 2019:\n149\u201352; LoLordo 2019: 11).\n",
