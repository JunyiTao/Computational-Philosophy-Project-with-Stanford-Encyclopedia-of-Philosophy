    "main_text": "Theory and value ladenness\n3. Theory and value ladenness\n\nEmpirical results are laden with values and theoretical commitments.\nPhilosophers have raised and appraised several possible kinds of\nepistemic problems that could be associated with theory and/or\nvalue-laden empirical results. They have worried about the extent to\nwhich human perception itself is distorted by our commitments. They\nhave worried that drawing upon theoretical resources from the very\ntheory to be appraised (or its competitors) in the generation of\nempirical results yields vicious circularity (or inconsistency). They\nhave also worried that contingent conceptual and/or linguistic\nframeworks trap bits of evidence like bees in amber so that they\ncannot carry on their epistemic lives outside of the contexts of their\norigination, and that normative values necessarily corrupt the\nintegrity of science. Do the theory and value-ladenness of empirical\nresults render them hopelessly parochial? That is, when scientists\nleave theoretical commitments behind and adopt new ones, must they\nalso relinquish the fruits of the empirical research imbued with their\nprior commitments too? In this section, we discuss these worries and\nresponses that philosophers have offered to assuage them.\n",
