    "main_text": "Composition Principles || Upper Bounds\n4.1 Upper Bounds\n\nConditions on composition are many. Beginning with the weakest, one\nmay consider a principle to the effect that any pair of suitably\nrelated entities must underlap, i.e., have an upper bound:\n\n\n(P.11\u03be)\n\u03be-Bound\n\n\u03bexy \u2192 \u2203z(Pxz \u2227\nPyz). \n\n\nExactly how \u2018\u03be\u2019 should be construed is, of course, an\nimportant question by itself\u2014a version of what van Inwagen\n(1987, 1990) calls the \u201cSpecial Composition Question\u201d. A\nnatural choice would be to identify \u03be with mereological overlap,\nthe rationale being that such a relation establishes an important tie\nbetween what may count as two distinct parts of a larger whole. As we\nshall see (Section 4.5), with \u03be so construed (P.11\u03be)\nis indeed rather uncontroversial. By contrast, the most liberal choice\nwould be to identify \u03be with the universal relation, in which case\n(P.11\u03be) would reduce to its consequent and assert the\nexistence of an upper bound for any pair of entities\nx and y. An axiom of this sort was used, for\ninstance, in Whitehead's (1919, 1920) mereology of\n events.[17]\n In any case, and regardless of any specific choice, it is apparent\nthat (P.11\u03be) does not express a strong condition on\ncomposition, as the consequent is trivially satisfied in any domain\nthat includes a universal entity of which everything is part, or any\nentity sufficiently large to include both x and y as\nparts regardless of how they are related.\n",
