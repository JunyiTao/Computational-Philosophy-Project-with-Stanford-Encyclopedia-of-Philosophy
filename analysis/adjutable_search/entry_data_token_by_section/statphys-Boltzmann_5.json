    "main_text": "The Sto\u00dfzahlansatz and the ergodic hypothesis || Doubts about the ergodic hypothesis\n2.1 Doubts about the ergodic hypothesis\n\n\nHowever, his doubts were still not laid to rest. His next paper on gas\ntheory (1871a) returns to the study of a detailed mechanical gas\nmodel, this time consisting of polyatomic molecules, and explicitly avoids any\nreliance on the ergodic hypothesis. And when he did return to the\nergodic hypothesis in (1871b), it was with much more caution. Indeed, it is\nhere that he actually first described the worrying assumption as an\nhypothesis, formulated as follows:\nThe great irregularity of the thermal motion and the\nmultitude of forces that act on a body make it probable that its atoms,\ndue to the motion we call heat, traverse all positions and velocities\nwhich are compatible with the principle of [conservation of] energy.\n(WA I, 284)\n\n Note that Boltzmann formulates this hypothesis for an arbitrary body,\ni.e., it is not restricted to gases. He also emphasizes, at the end of\nthe paper, that \u201cthe proof that this hypothesis is fulfilled for\nthermal bodies, or even is fullfillable, has not been provided\u201d (WA I,\n287). \n\n\nThere is a major confusion among modern commentators about the role\nand status of the ergodic hypothesis in Boltzmann's thinking. Indeed,\nthe question has often been raised how Boltzmann could ever have\nbelieved that a trajectory traverses all points on the energy\nhypersurface, since, as the Ehrenfests conjectured in 1911, and was\nshown almost immediately in 1913 by Plancherel and Rozenthal, this is\nmathematically impossible when the energy hypersurface has a dimension\nlarger than 1.\n\n\nIt is a fact that both (1868) [WA I, 96] and\n(1871b) [WA I, 284] mention external disturbances as an\ningredient in the motivation for the ergodic hypothesis. This might be\ntaken as evidence for \u2018interventionalism\u2019, i.e., the\nviewpoint that such external influences are crucial in the explanation\nof thermal phenomena (see Blatt 1959, Ridderbos & Redhead 1998).\nYet even though Boltzmann clearly expressed the thought that these\ndisturbances might help to motivate the ergodic hypothesis, he never\ntook the idea very seriously. The marginal note in the 1868 paper\nmentioned above indicated that, even if the system is disturbed, there\nis still no easy proof of the ergodic hypothesis, and all his further\ninvestigations concerning this hypothesis assume a system that is\neither completely isolated from its environment or at most acted upon\nby a static external force. Thus, interventionalism did not play a\nsignificant role in his\n thinking.[9] \n\n\nIt has also been suggested, in view of Boltzmann's later habit of\ndiscretising continuous variables, that he somehow thought of the\nenergy hypersurface as a discrete manifold containing only finitely\nmany discrete cells (Gallavotti 1994).  In this reading, obviously,\nthe mathematical no-go theorems of Rozenthal and Plancherel no longer\napply. Now it is definitely true that Boltzmann developed a preference\ntowards discretizing continuous variables, and would later apply this\nprocedure more and more (although usually adding that this was purely\nfor purposes of illustration and more easy understanding). However,\nthere is no evidence in the (1868) and (1871b) papers that Boltzmann\nimplicitly assumed a discrete structure of mechanical phase space or\nthe energy hypersurface.\n\n\nInstead, the context of his (1871b) makes clear enough how he intended\nthe hypothesis, as has already been argued by (Brush\n1976). Immediately preceding the section in which the hypothesis is\nintroduced, Boltzmann discusses trajectories for a simple example: a\ntwo-dimensional harmonic oscillator with potential \\(V(x,y) = ax^2 +\nby^2\\). For this system, the configuration point \\((x, y)\\) moves\nthrough the surface of a rectangle.  See Figure 1 below. (See also\nCercignani 1998, 148.)\n\n\n\nFigure 1.  \\(\\sqrt{a/b}\\) is\n    rational \\(( = 4/7 )\\).\n \n\n\n He then notes that if \\(a/b\\) is rational, (actually: if\n\\(\\sqrt{a/b}\\) is rational) this motion is periodic. However, if this\nvalue is irrational, the trajectory will, in the course of time,\ntraverse \u201calm\u00e4hlich die ganze Fl\u00e4che\u201d (WA I,\n271) of the rectangle. See Figure 2:\n\n\nFigure 2.  \\(\\sqrt{a/b}\\) is\n    irrational \\(( = 1/e )\\).\n \n\n\n He says in this case that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are independent,\nsince for each values of \\(x\\) an infinity of values for \\(y\\) in any\ninterval in its range are possible. The very fact that Boltzmann\nconsiders intervals for the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) of arbitrary\nsmall sizes, and stressed the distinction between rational and\nirrational values of the ratio \\(a/b\\), indicates that he\ndid not silently presuppose that phase space was essentially\ndiscrete, where those distinctions would make no sense.\n\n\nNow clearly, in modern language, one should say in the second case\nthat the trajectory lies densely in the surface, but not that\nit traverses all points. Boltzmann did not possess this language. In\nfact, he could not have been aware of Cantor's insight that the\ncontinuum contains more than a countable infinity of points. Thus, the\ncorrect statement that, in the case that \\(\\sqrt{a/b}\\) is irrational,\nthe trajectory will traverse, for each value of \\(x\\), an infinity of\nvalues of \\(y\\) within any interval however small, could easily have\nlead him to believe (incorrectly) that all values of \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\) are traversed in the course of time.\n\n\nIt thus seems eminently plausible, by the fact that this discussion\nimmediately precedes the formulation of the ergodic hypothesis, that\nthe intended reading of the ergodic hypothesis is really what the\nEhrenfests dubbed the quasi-ergodic hypothesis, namely, the\nassumption that the trajectory lies densely (i.e. passes arbitrarily\nclose to every point) on the energy\n hypersurface.[10]\n The quasi-ergodic hypothesis is not mathematically impossible in\nhigher-dimensional phase spaces. However, the quasi-ergodic hypothesis\ndoes not entail the desired conclusion that the only stationary\nprobability distribution over the energy surface is micro-canonical.\nOne might then still conjecture that if the system is quasi-ergodic,\nthe only continuous stationary distribution is microcanonical. But\neven this is fails in general (Nemytskii and Stepanov 1960). \n\n\nNevertheless, Boltzmann remained skeptical about the validity of his\nhypothesis. For this reason, he attempted to explore different routes\nto his goal of characterizing thermal equilibrium in mechanics. Indeed,\nboth the preceding (1871a) and his next paper (1871c) present alternative\narguments, with the explicit recommendation that they avoid hypotheses.\nIn fact, he did not return to this hypothesis until the 1880s\n(stimulated by Maxwell's 1879 review of the last section of Boltzmann's\n1868 paper). At that time, perhaps feeling fortified by Maxwell's\nauthority, he would express much more confidence in the ergodic\nhypothesis (see Section 5). \n\n\nSo what role did the ergodic hypothesis play? It seems that Boltzmann\nregarded the ergodic hypothesis as a special dynamical assumption that\nmay or may not be true, depending on the nature of the system, and\nperhaps also on its initial state. Its role was simply to help derive\na result of great generality: for any system for which the hypothesis\nis true, its unique equilibrium state is characterized by the\nmicrocanonical distribution (3), from which a form of the Maxwell\ndistribution may be recovered in the limit \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\),\nregardless of any details of the inter-particle interactions, or\nindeed whether the system represented is a gas, fluid, solid or any\nother thermal body.  Note also that the microcanonical distribution\nimmediately implies that the probability of finding the system in any\nregion on the energy hypersurface is proportional to the size of that\nregion (as measured by the microcanonical measure). This idea would\nresurface in his 1877 combinatorial argument, although then without\nthe context of characterizing equilibrium thermal equilibrium.\n\n\nThe Ehrenfests have suggested that the ergodic hypothesis played a\nmuch more fundamental role. In particular they have pointed out that if\nthe hypothesis is true, averaging over an (infinitely) long time would\nbe identical to phase averaging with the microcanonical distribution.\nThus, they suggested that Boltzmann relied on the ergodic hypothesis in\norder to equate time averages and phase averages, or in other words, to\nequate two meaning of probability (relative time and relative volume in\nphase space.) There is however no evidence that Boltzmann ever followed\nthis line of reasoning. He simply never gave any justification for\nequivocating time and particle averages, or phase averages, at all.\nPresumably, he thought nothing much depended on this issue and that it\nwas a matter of taste.\n",
