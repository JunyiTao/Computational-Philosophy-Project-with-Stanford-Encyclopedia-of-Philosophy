    "main_text": "Testing Arguments\n4. Testing Arguments\n\nThe ultimate goal of informal logic is normative: an account of\nargument and systems of informal logic that can be used to determine\nwhen and whether real life arguments are strong or weak, good or bad,\nconvincing or unconvincing. Standardizing prepares arguments for such\nassessment. This makes T in the BLAST definition \u2014 the\ntools and methods which are used to test argument strength \u2014 the\nmost important defining element in a system of informal logic. \n\nAlmost all informal logics understand a good (strong) argument to be\nan argument with \u201cacceptable\u201d premises and a\n\u201cvalid\u201d inference \u2014 i.e. a conclusion that follows\nfrom them. Hansen 2012 has argued that informal logic should follow\nclassical logic, and not concern itself with the assessment of premise\nacceptability, but its engagement with real life arguments (and the\ndesire to evaluate them in a fulsome way) has produced a field that\nincludes this within argument evaluation. In this and in other\nregards, systems of informal logic adopt many different approaches to\nargument assessment. \n4.1 AV Criteria\n\nIn classical logic, an argument is (deductively) valid if it is\nimpossible for its premises to be true and its conclusion false. On\nthis account, the ultimate aim of arguing is a \u201csound\u201d\nargument: i.e. a valid argument with true premises. \n\nWithin informal logic, the simplest criterion for good arguments is an\ninformal analogue of soundness. It understands a good argument to be\nan argument that justifies its conclusion by providing good (strong,\ncredible, etc.) reasons for believing it. Within the argument, this\nimplies premises which are \u201cacceptable\u201d and a conclusion\nthat follows from them. We can summarize this basic criterion as\nT = {A,V}, where A is an account of\npremise acceptability, and V is an account of informal validity\nwhich determines when a conclusion follows from premises in a way that\nis approved of (deductively, inductively, conductively, and/or\nabductively, etc.). \n\nFollowing Johnson and Blair (1977, 1994), many systems of informal\nlogic adopt an ARS version of these AV criteria, making\n\u201cAcceptability, Relevance and Sufficiency\u201d the\nrequirements for good argument. On this account, premises are\nacceptable when they are true or acceptable in some other way;\nrelevant when they provide some (i.e. any) support for the conclusion\nof the argument; and sufficient when they provide enough support to\nwarrant its acceptance \u2014 as likely, true, plausible, etc. \n\nPremise Acceptability\n\n\nWithin informal arguments, premises may be acceptable in a variety of\nways. In many circumstances, they are acceptable if they are likely\ntrue and unacceptable if likely false. \n\nIt is worth noting that this truth criterion can be expanded to apply\nto visual premises. An image functioning as a visual premise may, for\nexample, be evaluated as a \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d\ndepiction of what it represents. A photograph or an image may be\nunacceptable because it is untrustworthy or categorizes a situation in\na misleading way. Photographs are often \u2018doctored\u2019 or in\nother ways designed to present things in ways that do not accurately\nreflect what is photographed. Other kinds of multimodal premises can\nbe understood as likely true to the extent that they are a reliable\nbasis for an inference. \n\nIn some kinds of dialogue \u2014 in the exchanges that characterize\nnegotiation, bargaining, eristic, and persuasion \u2014 acceptable\npremises may not need to be true. In bargaining\n(\u201chaggling\u201d) a buyer may claim that \u201cI will not give\nyou a penny more than $300 for that lamp\u201d as a premise in\nsupport of the conclusion that the seller should agree to a lower\nprice. This counts as an acceptable premise even if it is an idle\nthreat that the buyer will never carry out, for threats of this sort\nare an acceptable element of the arguments that take place in this\nkind of dialogue. \n\nIn other cases, informal logics use acceptability rather than truth as\na criterion for judging premises in contexts in which it is difficult\nto judge premises as true or false. In such cases, acceptable premises\nmay be plausible (or exploratory) hypotheses, claims that can only be\nsaid to be generally accepted or assumed, or ethical or aesthetic\njudgments which are not easily categorized as true or false. \n\nIn still other circumstances, truth may be required for acceptability,\nbut only one of a number of conditions that must be satisfied. Even\nwhen a premise is true, it may be unacceptable because it violates the\nrules of interaction that govern the dialogue in which it is embedded.\nIn a legal proceeding or a formal hearing, premises and arguments must\nnot entertain premises that violate rules of procedure. \n\nIn situations in which arguments are attempts to convince a specific\naudience of a conclusion, an acceptable premise may need to be true,\nbut also acceptable to the members of this audience. As Aristotle\nsuggests in the Rhetoric, successful arguments may need to\nhave premises that are in keeping with the pathos of an\naudience (and do so in a way that does not undermine the character\n\u2014 the ethos \u2014 of the arguer). As Gilbert 1997,\n2014 has emphasized, there are many real life circumstances in which\nthe emotional acceptability of a premise is required for argument\nsuccess. \n\nOne of the first VR productions by the New York Times was\n\u201cKiya,\u201d a production which recreated an incidence of\ndomestic abuse in an attempt to provide support for the importance of\nattempts to address issues of domestic violence. Its producer\ndescribes it as an attempt to use \u201cthe immersive power of\nvirtual reality: its ability to generate intense empathy on the part\nof the viewer; to wring from the audience the intense emotional\nconnection that these stories deserve\u201d (NYT, Jan 21, 2016). \n\nInference Validity\n\n\nIn its attempt to account for a broad range of real life arguing,\ninformal logics have expanded traditional notions of premise\nacceptability. Something similar has happened in the case of inference\nvalidity. The end result is an expansion of both sides of the\nAV criteria for good argument. \n\nIn the case of inference validity, this expansion has been\naccomplished by treating deductive validity as one variant of\nvalidity, and by recognizing other \u201cdefeasible,\u201d\nnon-deductive ways in which premises may entail conclusions. Govier\n1987 dubs the deductive/inductive distinction as \u201cthe great\ndivide,\u201d emphasizing the latter over the former. Sometimes\ninformal logic systems understand inductive arguments narrowly, as\ninductive generalizations. Sometimes more broadly, as arguments which\nhave premises that imply that a conclusion is (only) probable or\nplausible, leaving open the possibility that it is false. \n\n\u201cConductive\u201d arguments support their conclusions by\naccumulating non-decisive reasons in their favor. They are valid when\nthey collective enough reasons to warrant their conclusions. In a\nparticular case, different elements of evidence may suggest but not\nprove that someone charged with murder is guilty but make the\nconclusion likely if enough evidence of this sort is accumulated (a\nwitness claims he pulled the trigger, the ballistics report shows that\nthe bullet came from a gun he owned, he wrote an e-mail saying he\nwould \u201cget\u201d the victim, etc.). \n\nStrong \u201cabductive\u201d arguments are convincing instances of\n\u201cinference to the best explanation\u201d (see Harman 1965).\nThey recognize some facts, point out that they are entailed by some\nhypothesis, and conclude that the hypothesis is true. Taken at face\nvalue, abductive arguments appear to be instances of the deductive\nfallacy \u201caffirming the consequent,\u201d but play an important\nrole to play in medical, scientific and legal inquiry (see Walton\n2004).\n4.2 Fallacy Theory\n\nAV criteria are in many ways an extension of the notion of good\nargument enshrined in classical logic. In the search for ways to deal\nwith real life arguments, some informal logicians have moved in a\ndifferent direction, reviving fallacy theory as an alternative.\nHamblin 1970 has become a touchstone for moves in this direction. \n\nSystems of informal logic that rely on fallacies test arguments by\nasking whether their proponents are guilty of fallacious reasoning.\nWhile there is no agreed-upon taxonomy of fallacies, many canonical\nfallacies have been emphasized in the analysis of informal arguments.\nThey include formal fallacies like affirming the consequent and\ndenying the antecedent; and informal fallacies like ad\nhominem (\u201cagainst the person\u201d), slippery slope,\nad baculum (\u201cappeal to threat or force\u201d), ad\nmisericordiam (\u201cappeal to pity\u201d), \u201chasty\ngeneralization,\u201d and \u201ctwo wrongs\u201d reasoning (as in\n\u201ctwo wrongs don\u2019t make a right\u201d). The systems of\ninformal logic taught in textbooks often add specialized variants of\nthe standard fallacies (\u201cmisleading vividness\u201d designates\nthe misuse of vivid anecdotal evidence in hasty generalizations, and\nso on.) \n\nWoods and Walton 1982 and Hansen and Pinto 1995 contain detailed\ndiscussions of the definition, analysis and assessment of fallacies.\nIn argumentation theory, van Eemeren and Grootendorst 1992 propose a\n\u201cpragma-dialectical\u201d account of fallacies which treats\nthem as violations of rules that govern critical discussion --\ndialogues that attempt to resolve a difference of opinion. Battersby\nand Bailin 2011 view fallacies as patterns of argument patterns\n\u201cwhose persuasive power greatly exceeds its probative [i.e.\nevidential] value,\u201d making fallacies errors in reasoning that\nordinary arguers are attracted to in view of their rhetorical appeal.\n\n\nSome fallacies \u2014 e.g., equivocation and begging the question\n(i.e. circular reasoning) \u2014 highlight important issues that\nfrequently interfere with real life arguing, but fallacy theory has\nbeen criticized when it is adopted as a general account of argument.\nThe issues this raises include its unsystematic nature, disagreements\nabout the definition and nature of specific fallacies, and the\nemphasis that fallacy theory places on faulty reasoning rather than\ngood argument. Hitchcock (1995, 324) writes that the idea that we\nshould teach reasoning by fallacies is \u201clike saying that the\nbest way to teach somebody to play tennis without making the common\nmistakes is to demonstrate these faults in action and get him to label\nand respond to them\u201d (see Feldman 2009). \n\nThe theoretical issues raised by fallacy theory are compounded by\ninstances of traditional fallacies which have a reasonable role to\nplay in real life arguing. Appeals to pity and other appeals to\nemotion have, to take one example, a legitimate role to play in moral,\npolitical and aesthetic debate. The following examples highlight other\ncircumstances in which arguments which fit the definition of a\ntraditional fallacy cannot be so readily dismissed. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 12:\n\nA remark from a Danish television debate over the question whether the\nDanish church should be separated from the Danish state (Jorgensen\n1995, 369): \u201cYou should not listen to my opponent. He wants to\nsever the Danish church from the state for his own personal\nsake.\u201d This seems a classic example of ad hominem,\nKahane 1995 (p. 65), describing it as a fallacy that occurs when an\narguer attacks \u201chis opponent rather than his opponent\u2019s\nevidence and arguments.\u201d But this is an accusation of conflict\nof interest which cannot be dismissed out of hand. If there is reason\nto believe that an arguer favors a point of view because they have\nsomething to gain from it (say, the purchase of a company in which\nthey own shares), this does raise questions about the extent to which\ntheir arguments should be entertained.\n\nEXAMPLE 13:\n\nMartin Luther King Jr., influenced by Gandhi, argued that one can\njustifiably break laws in a struggle for social justice. Such\narguments play a central role in the civil rights movement. They\ncannot be summarily dismissed, though they appear to be clear cases of\n\u201ctwo wrongs make a right.\u201d\n\nEXAMPLE 14:\n\nThe argument that \u201cthe attempt to use military force to put an\nend to terrorism is wrong because it will take us down a slippery\nslope that will end in improper interference in the affairs of\nindependent states\u201d cannot be dismissed because it is an\ninstance of slippery slope reasoning. If it is true that some action\nwill precipitate a chain of consequences that lead down an alleged\nslippery slope, this is a good reason to question it.\n\n\nExamples of this sort have forced careful accounts of fallacies to\nmake room for reasonable arguments which share the form of traditional\nfallacies. \n\nIn doing so, it is helpful to distinguish between fallacies which do\nand do not have non-fallacious instances. Equivocation, post hoc\nergo propter hoc, non sequitor and hasty generalization\nare commonly classified as forms of argument that are inherently\nmistaken. In contrast, traditional fallacies like ad hominem,\ntwo wrongs reasoning, guilt by association, and appeal to pity are\npatterns of reasoning which can, when they are constructed in the\nright way, play a legitimate role within real life reasoning (and are,\nin view of this, sometimes treated as argument schemes rather than\nfallacies). \n4.3 Natural Language Deductivism\n\nNatural Language Deductivism (\u201cNLD\u201d) is an approach to\ninformal reasoning that retains classical logic\u2019s focus on\ndeductive validity (see Groarke 1999, and\n Govier 1987,\n who develops an initial account NLD, but ultimately favors a more\nradical break from classical logic). It suggests that we should\ninterpret informal arguments as attempts to create deductively valid\ninferences which can be analyzed and assessed accordingly. In a\ndeductivist system of informal logic, the V in the AV\ncriteria for good arguments is this classical notion of validity. \n\nNLD has frequently been rejected on the basis of the common, but\nmistaken, notion that deductively valid arguments must have certain\nconclusions \u2014 a misconception that seems founded deductive\nvalidity\u2019s historical connections to formal logic and\nmathematics (see Groarke 1999). It is true that ordinary arguing\nrarely satisfies the strict proof procedures they imply, but deductive\nvalidity is not restricted to this compass and there are many\ninstances of ordinary argument which are clear examples of deductively\nvalid argument. \n\nIn cases of deductive reasoning, the conclusion of an argument need\nnot be certain, but only as certain the premises, creating ample room\nfor conclusions which are merely likely, plausible, or probable.\nEXAMPLE 15 is taken from a radio commentary on population growth. \n\nEXAMPLE 15:\n\nThe population of the world will grow from 6 to 9 billion in the next\nfifteen years so we will, if we are to provide sufficient food for\neveryone, need to find a way to provide food for an additional 3\nbillion people.\n\n\nIn this case, the premise of the argument is not certain, but\nreasonably thought to be true \u2014 because it was (in the\ncommentary) backed by an extrapolation from well established\npopulation trends. The deductively valid inference based upon it makes\nit reasonable to judge the conclusion of the argument true as well,\nthough it is not certain, as all predictions about population growth\nare, at best, plausible conjectures. \n\nNLD\u2019s plausibility as a general theory of argument turns on its\naccount of arguments which are not prima facie deductive. Faced with\narguments of this sort, it preserves the deductivist approach by\nattributing an implicit premise (essentially, a deductive warrant) to\nsuch arguments in a way that deductively connects an argument\u2019s\npremises to its conclusion. Typically this is an\n\u201cassociated\u201d conditional of the form \u201cIf P, then\nC\u201d where P is the argument\u2019s premises and C is its\nconclusion. \n\nA 2015 blog by a professional dietician (Dr. Cristina Sutter)\ncriticizes arguments that justify the claim that garcinia cambogia is\na miracle weight loss pill by appealing to the authority of the\npopular television personality \u201cDr. Oz.\u201d \u2014 instances\nof the reasoning \u201cDr. Oz Says It, So It Must Be True.\u201d We\ncan standardize the pattern of argument she criticizes as: \n\n\nEXAMPLE 16:\n\nPremise: Dr. Oz says [that gracinia cambogia is a miracle\nweight loss pill].\n\nConclusion: This must be true. \n\n\nIf one judges only by the explicit premise in this argument\n(\u201cDr. Oz says...\u201d), this is not a deductively valid\nargument, for it is obvious that the premise could be true and the\nconclusion false: Dr. Oz could say gracinia cambogia is a miracle\nweight loss pill and be wrong. That said, anyone using this argument\nmust assume an associated conditional which can be understood as an\nimplicit premise, allowing us to standardize the argument as: \n\n\nPremise: Dr. Oz says [that gracinia cambogia is a miracle\nweight loss pill].\n\nImplicit Premise: If Dr. Oz says this, it must be true.\n\nConclusion: This must be true. \n\n\nSo understood, the Dr. Oz argument is deductively valid, but not\nsound, as it is a valid argument with a problematic implicit premise.\n\n\nNLD deals with inductive generalizations in a similar way. Consider\nthe following example from a conversation about French men.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 17:\n\n\u201cFrench men are fastidious about their appearance. I have worked\nwith many and this was what I found.\u201d \n\n\nIn this example, the move from the premise to the conclusion of the\nargument assumes that the sample of French men the arguer is familiar\nwith are a representative sample of French men. If this is not likely,\nthen the sample does not provide good reasons for concluding that\nFrench men are, in general, as fastidious if they are. If we recognize\nthis assumption as an implicit premise when we standardize the\nargument, then the argument is deductively valid, for a representative\nsample is a subset of a population that accurately reflects the\ncharacteristics of the larger group. \n\nIn this way, NLD turns the uncertainty that characterizes inductive\ngeneralizations (and other forms of informal validity) into\nuncertainty that is connected to an associated conditional which\nwarrants the move from an argument\u2019s premises to it conclusion.\nThis does not eliminate such uncertainty, but maintains it as a key\nconsideration in argument evaluation, for it makes the status of this\nwarrant an essential element of premise acceptability. \n\nIn favor of NLD, it has been argued that reconstruction of many\narguments it proposes is a dialectically useful way to make explicit\nthe key assumptions that arguments depend on, and frees us from the\nneed to distinguish between different kinds of validity in ways that\ncan be problematic when they are applied to real life arguing. The\npragma-dialectical account of indirect speech acts (Eemeren and\nGrootendorst 2002, Groarke 1999) provides a way to reconstruct\narguments as deductive arguments when NLD requires it, though Johnson\n2000 and Godden 2004 argue that NLD is an artificial theory which\nforces informal arguments to adhere to an overly restrictive model of\ninference. \n4.4 Argument Schemes\n\nArgument (or \u201cargumentation\u201d) schemes are recurring\npatterns of reasoning. Once identified they can be used to evaluate an\nargument which is instance of a scheme, or as a template or recipe\narguers can use when they construct an argument which is an instance\nof a scheme. Walton, Reed and Macagno 2008 provide a compendium of 96\nschemes. Wageman has developed a\n  Periodic Table of Arguments\n which provides a systematized account of basic schemes. \n\nRules of inference like modus ponens and modus\ntollens can be understood as deductive schemes. Other schemes\ncommonly used in ordinary arguing include Argument by Sign, Argument\nby Analogy, Argument by Example, and Slippery Slope Reasoning. Dove\n2016 and Groarke 2019 have shown how visual arguments with non-verbal\nvisual elements may be instances of common schemes, and have\nidentified some schemes which are inherently visual. \n\nThe most common approach to argument schemes combines a pattern of\nargument with a set of \u201ccritical questions\u201d with which it\nis associated. The scheme Argument from Authority\n(\u201cAppeal to Authority,\u201d \u201cAppeal to Expert\nOpinion\u201d) and the critical questions it raises can be formalized\nas follows. \n\nA is an authority in domain D.\n\nA says that T is true.\n\nT is within D.\n\n(Therefore) T is true.\n\n\nCritical questions:\n\n1. How credible is A?\n\n2. Is A an authority in domain D?\n\n3. What did A assert that implies T?\n\n4. Is A someone who can be trusted?\n\n5. Is T consistent with what other experts assert?\n\n6. Is A\u2019s assertion of T based on evidence?\n\n\n\nPrakken 2010b understands argument schemes as inference rules, some\ncritical questions ensuring the truth of an argument\u2019s premises,\nothers ensuring that the context of the inference is appropriate. \n\nAnother approach to schemes builds the answers to critical questions\ninto a \u2018full\u2019 definition of the scheme, treating them as\nrequired premises in convincing instances of the scheme. Taking this\napproach, the scheme Argument from Authority can be defined\nas follows.\n\n\nA is a credible authority in the domain D.\n\nA asserted X, which implies T.\n\nA can be trusted and T is within domain D.\n\nT is consistent with what other experts in domain D assert.\n\nA\u2019s assertion of T is based on evidence.\n\n(Therefore) T is true. \n\n\nThe critical question approach to schemes suggests that a credible\nargument from authority must include acceptable premises of the form\noutlined in the definition of the scheme, and is valid if it is backed\nby answers to the scheme\u2019s critical questions. Taking the\n\u2018full\u2019 approach, a valid argument from authority must\ninclude the premises that define it as as a good argument as explicit\n(or possibly implicit) premises. In both cases, the result is an\naccount of premise acceptability and validity which is tailored to\nspecifically apply to arguments from authority. \n\nDifferent argument schemes are a refinement of general AV\ncriteria, creating specific criteria which can be applied to different\nkinds of argument. \n\nWhen a student essay claims that \u201cwe should not stockpile\nnuclear weapons\u201d because Einstein told us that this would lead\n\u201cto destruction even more terrible than the present destruction\nof life\u201d (EXAMPLE 18), this is an appeal to authority which\ninvokes Einstein as an authority. In order for it to be a convincing\nargument from authority, it would need to fully satisfy the conditions\noutlined in our definition of the scheme Argument from\nAuthority. \n\nThe attempt to satisfy the requirements this implies produces a\nversion of the argument which can be summarized as follows.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 18 expanded to satisfy the criteria for a convincing argument\nfrom authority:\n\n1. Einstein (A) is a credible authority on nuclear weapons (D).\n\n2. Einstein (A) asserted that the stockpiling of nuclear weapons would\nprecipitate \u201cdestruction even more terrible than the present\ndestruction of life\u201d (X), which implies that we should not\nstockpile nuclear weapons (T).\n\n3. Einstein (A) can be trusted and questions about stockpiling nuclear\nweapons (T) are questions about nuclear weapons (D).\n\n4. The claim that we should not stockpile nuclear weapons (T) is\nconsistent with what other experts on nuclear weapons (D) assert.\n\n5. Einstein\u2019s (A\u2019s) assertion that we should not stockpile\nnuclear weapons (T) is based on evidence.\n\n6. (Therefore) We should not stockpile nuclear weapons (T). \n\n\nThis attempt to satisfy the conditions for a good instance of argument\nfrom authority fails because it produces a number of problematic\npremises. Other experts disagreed (and continue to disagree) with\nEinstein\u2019s suggestion that it is a mistake to stockpile nuclear\nweapons. More fundamentally, the proposed argument is founded on too\nloose an account of nuclear weapons as a domain of expertise. Einstein\nis a renowned expert on nuclear physics but this it does not make him\nan expert on the social and political issues raised by\nnuclear weapons. This is something that a convincing version of the\nargument would have to establish. \n\nIn some ways, the scheme approach to argument assessment rectifies\nproblems that arise in systems of informal logic that adopt the\nfallacy approach to argument evaluation. For traditional fallacies\nwhich have non-fallacious instances can be understood, not as\nfallacies, but as argumentation schemes which are legitimate forms of\nreasoning when they are properly employed. Fallacy definitions can be\nturned into scheme definitions by identifying a list of critical\nquestions (or required premises) that specify what is required to make\nthe arguments in question valid. \n\nAd hominem is a case in point, for there are many instances\nin which criticisms of an arguer (rather than their position) are a\nreasonable way to cast doubt on their views. We can specify when this\nis so by listing critical questions that determine whether this is so\nin a particular case of argument. The basic question that must be\nasked is whether there is a good reason why the arguer\u2019s views\nshould not be taken seriously \u2014 a question that subsumes the\nmore specific questions whether they have repeatedly shown poor\njudgment, are biased, lack expertise in the area in question, or are\nfor some other reason an arguer who should not be listened to. \n\nTreated in this way, ad hominem is a legitimate scheme of\nargument, but there are (as there are in the case of all schemes) many\nsituations in which ad hominem arguments are poor instances\nof the scheme. In this and many other cases, traditional fallacies can\nbe regarded as deviations from an inherently correct scheme of\nreasoning. \n4.5 Testing Systems\n\nMost informal logics combine different ways of evaluating arguments.\nIn this way, T in a particular system tends to be some combined\nset of tools that can be used in this endeavor. In most cases,\nT = {F, AV, AS}, where F is some\nlist of fallacies, AV is some kind of AV criteria (say,\nthe standard ARS criteria) and AS is some set of\nargumentation schemes. \n\nBut systems of informal logic can accommodate other, less common\ncriteria for deciding whether arguments are good or bad, strong or\nweak. A system might, for example, incorporate criteria which are\nfounded on a virtue-based approach to argument (see\n Virtues and Arguments),\n on feminist principles, or on notions derived from rhetoric, theories\nof communication, or other cognate fields.  The issues raised by\nthe different kinds of standards that govern arguing in different\nkinds of dialogue can be be accommodated by formulating complex\ntesting systems that include different criteria which apply to\ndifferent kinds of dialogue. A system which aggregates these different\ncriteria may be the best way to build a truly comprehensive account of\nreal life reasoning.\n\n",
