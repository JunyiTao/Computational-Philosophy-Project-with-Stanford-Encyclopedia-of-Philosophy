    "main_text": "Principles of Equality and Justice\n2. Principles of Equality and Justice\n\nEquality in its prescriptive usage is closely linked to morality and\njustice, and distributive justice in particular. Since antiquity\nequality has been considered a constitutive feature of justice. (On\nthe history of the concept, cf. Albernethy 1959, Benn 1967, Brown\n1988, Dann 1975, Thomson 1949.) People and movements throughout\nhistory have used the language of justice to contest inequalities. But\nwhat kind of role does equality play in a theory of justice?\nPhilosophers have sought to clarify this by defending a variety of\nprinciples and conceptions of equality. This section introduces four\nsuch principles, ranging from the highly general and uncontroversial\nto the more specific and controversial. The next section reviews\nvarious conceptions of the \u2018currency\u2019 of equality.\nDifferent interpretations of the role of equality in a theory of\njustice emerge according to which of the four principles and metrics\nhave been adopted. The first three principles of equality hold\ngenerally and primarily for all actions upon others and affecting\nothers, and for their resulting circumstances. From the fourth\nprinciple onward, i.e., starting with the presumption of equality, the\nfocus will be mainly on distributive justice and the evaluation of\ndistribution.\n",
