    "main_text": "\n\nPeter Abelard (1079\u201321 April 1142) [\u2018Abailard\u2019 or\n\u2018Abaelard\u2019 or \u2018Habalaarz\u2019 and so on] was the\npre-eminent philosopher and theologian of the twelfth century. The\nteacher of his generation, he was also famous as a poet and a\nmusician. Prior to the recovery of Aristotle, he brought the native\nLatin tradition in philosophy to its highest pitch. His genius was\nevident in all he did. He is, arguably, the greatest logician of the\nMiddle Ages and is equally famous as the first great nominalist\nphilosopher. He championed the use of reason in matters of faith (he\nwas the first to use \u2018theology\u2019 in its modern sense), and\nhis systematic treatment of religious doctrines are as remarkable for\ntheir philosophical penetration and subtlety as they are for their\naudacity. Abelard seemed larger than life to his contemporaries: his\nquick wit, sharp tongue, perfect memory, and boundless arrogance made\nhim unbeatable in debate\u2014he was said by supporter and detractor\nalike never to have lost an argument\u2014and the force of his\npersonality impressed itself vividly on all with whom he came into\ncontact. His luckless affair with H\u00e9lo\u00efse made him a\ntragic figure of romance, and his conflict with Bernard of Clairvaux\nover reason and religion made him the hero of the Enlightenment. For\nall his colourful life, though, his philosophical achievements are the\ncornerstone of his fame.\n",
