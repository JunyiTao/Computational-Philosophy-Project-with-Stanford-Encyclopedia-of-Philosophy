    "main_text": "Beauty\n1. Beauty\n\nThe study of Plato on beauty must begin with one warning. The Greek\nadjective kalon only approximates to the English\n\u201cbeautiful.\u201d Not everything Plato says about a\nkalos, kal\u00ea, or kalon thing will\nbelong in a summary of his aesthetic theories. \n\nReaders can take this distinction between the Greek and English terms\ntoo far. It always feels more scrupulous to argue against equating\nwords from different languages than to treat them interchangeably. And\nthe discussion bears more on assessments of Platonic ethical theory\nthan on whatever subject may be called Plato\u2019s aesthetics.\n\nBut even given these qualifications the reader should know how to tell\nwhat is beautiful from what is kalon. To begin with the terms\nhave overlapping but distinct ranges of application. A passage in\nPlato may speak of a face or body that someone finds kalon,\nor for that matter a statue, a spoon, a tree, a grassy place to rest\n(Phaedrus 230b). Then \u201cbeautiful\u201d makes a natural\nequivalent, certainly less stilted than the alternatives. And yet even\nhere it is telling that Plato far more often uses kalon for a\nface or body than for works of art and natural scenery. As far as\nunambiguous beauties are concerned, he has a smaller set in mind than\nwe do (Kosman 2010).\n\nMore typically kalon appears in contexts to which\n\u201cbeautiful\u201d would fit awkwardly if at all. For both Plato\nand Aristotle\u2014and in many respects for Greek popular\nmorality\u2014kalon has a particular role to play as ethical\napprobation, not by meaning the same thing that agathon\n\u201cgood\u201d means, but as a special complement to goodness. At\ntimes kalon narrowly means \u201cnoble,\u201d often and\nmore loosely \u201cadmirable.\u201d The compound kalos\nk\u2019agathos, the aristocratic ideal, is all-round praise, not\n\u201cbeautiful and good\u201d as its components would translate\nseparately, but closer to \u201csplendid and upright.\u201d Here\nkalon is entirely an ethical term. Calling virtue beautiful\nfeels misplaced in modern terms, or even perverse; calling wisdom\nbeautiful, as the Symposium does (204b), will sound like a\nmistake (Kosman 2010, 348\u2013350).\n\nSome commentators try to keep kalon and\n\u201cbeautiful\u201d close to synonymous despite these differences\nin their semantic ranges (Hyland 2008). David Konstan has rejuvenated\nthe question by emphasizing the beauty not in uses of the adjective\nkalon but in the related noun kallos (Konstan 2014,\nKonstan 2015). As welcome as this shift of focus is regarding Greek\nwriting as a whole, it runs into difficulties when we read Plato; for\nkallos carries overtones of physical, visual attractiveness,\nand Plato is cautious about the desire that such attractiveness\narouses.\n\nRather than seek a Greek equivalent for \u201cbeautiful,\u201d\ntranslators often choose another English word for kalon. One\nrightly popular choice is \u201cfine,\u201d which applies to most\nthings labeled kalon and is also appropriate to ethical and\naesthetic contexts (so Woodruff 1983). There are fine suits and string\nquartets but also fine displays of courage. Of course modern\nEnglish-speakers have fine sunsets and fine dining as well, this word\nbeing even broader than kalon. That is not to mention fine\npoints or fine print. And whereas people frequently ask what beauty\nreally consists in, so that a conversation on the topic might actually\nhave taken place, it is hard to imagine worrying over \u201cwhat the\nfine is\u201d or \u201cwhat is really fine.\u201d\n\nThe telling criterion will be not philological but philosophical.\nStudying the Hippias Major each reader should ask whether\nPlato\u2019s treatment of to kalon sounds relevant to questions\none asks about beauty today.\n",
