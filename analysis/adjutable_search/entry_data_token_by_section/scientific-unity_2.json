    "main_text": "Historical development in philosophy and science from Greek philosophy to Logical Empiricism in America || German tradition since Kant\n1.3 German tradition since Kant\n\nFor Kant, one of the functions of philosophy was to determine the\nprecise unifying scope and value of each science. For him, the unity\nof science is not the reflection of a unity found in nature, or, even\nless, assumed in a real world behind the apparent phenomena. Rather,\nit has its foundations in the unifying a priori character or function\nof concepts, principles and of Reason itself. Nature is precisely our\nexperience of the world under the universal laws that include such\nconcepts. And science, as a system of knowledge, is \u201ca whole of\ncognition ordered according to principles\u201d, and the principles\non which proper science is grounded are a priori (Preface to\nMetaphysical Foundations of Natural Science). A devoted but\nnot exclusive follower of Newton\u2019s achievements and insights, he\nmaintained through most of his life that mathematization and a priori\nuniversal laws given by the understanding were preconditions for\ngenuine scientific character (like Galileo and Descartes earlier, and\nCarnap later, Kant believed that mathematical exactness constituted\nthe main condition for the possibility of objectivity). Here Kant\nemphasized the role of mathematics coordinating a priori cognition and\nits determined objects of experience. Thus, he contrasted the methods\nemployed by the chemist, a \u201csystematic art\u201d organized by\nempirical regularities, with those employed by the mathematician or\nphysicist, which were organized by a priori laws, and he held that\nbiology is not reducible to mechanics\u2014as the former involves\nexplanations in terms of final causes (see Critique of Pure\nReason, Critique of Judgment and Metaphysical\nFoundations of Natural Science). With regards to\nbiology\u2014insufficiently grounded in the fundamental forces of\nmatter\u2014its inclusion requires the introduction of the idea of\npurposiveness (McLaughlin 1991). More generally, for Kant, unity was a\nregulative principle of reason, namely, an ideal guiding the process\nof inquiry toward a complete empirical science with its empirical\nconcepts and principles grounded in the so-called concepts and\nprinciples of the understanding that constitute and objectify\nempirical phenomena. (On systematicity as a distinctive aspect of this\nideal and on its origin in reason, see Kitcher 1986 and\nHoyningen-Huene 2013).\n\nKant\u2019s ideas set the frame of reference for discussions of the\nunification of the sciences in German thought throughout the\nnineteenth century (Wood and Hahn 2011). He gave philosophical\ncurrency to the notion of worldview (Weltanschauung) and,\nindirectly, world-picture (Weltbild), establishing among\nphilosophers and scientists the notion of the unity of science as an\nintellectual ideal. From Kant, German-speaking Philosophers of Nature\nadopted the image of Nature in terms of interacting forces or powers\nand developed it in different ways; this image found its way to\nBritish natural philosophy. In Great Britain this idealist, unifying\nspirit (and other notions of an idealist and romantic turn) was\narticulated in William Whewell\u2019s philosophy of science. Two\nunifying dimensions are these: his notion of mind-constructed\nfundamental ideas, which form the basis for organizing axioms and\nphenomena and classifying sciences, and the argument for the reality\nof explanatory causes in the form of consilience of\ninduction, wherein a single cause is independently arrived at\nas the hypothesis explaining different kinds of phenomena.\n\nIn face of expanding research, the unifying emphasis on organization,\nclassification and foundation led to exploring differences and\nrationalizing boundaries. The German intellectual current culminated\nin the late-nineteenth century in the debates among philosophers such\nas Windelband, Rickert and Dilthey. In their views and those of\nsimilar thinkers, a worldview often included elements of evaluation\nand life meaning. Kant had established the basis for the famous\ndistinction between the natural sciences\n(Naturwissenschaften) and the cultural, or social, sciences\n(Geisteswissesnschaften) popularized in theory of science by\nWilhelm Dilthey and Wilhelm Windelband. Dilthey, Windelband, his\nstudent Heinrich Rickert, and Max Weber (although the first two\npreferred Kulturwissenschaften, which excluded psychology)\ndebated over how differences in subject matter between the two kinds\nof sciences forced a distinctive difference between their respective\nmethods. Their preoccupation with the historical dimension of the\nhuman phenomena, along with the Kantian emphasis on the conceptual\nbasis of knowledge, led to the suggestion that the natural sciences\naimed at generalizations about abstract types and properties, whereas\nthe human sciences studied concrete individuals and complexes. The\nhuman case suggested a different approach based on valuation and\npersonal understanding (Weber\u2019s verstehen). For\nRickert, individualized concept formation secured knowledge of\nhistorical individuals by establishing connections to recognized\nvalues (rather than personal valuations). In biology, Ernst Haeckel\ndefended a monistic worldview (Richards 2008).\n\nThe Weltbild tradition influenced the physicists Max Planck\nand Ernst Mach, who engaged in a heated debate about the precise\ncharacter of the unified scientific world-picture. Mach\u2019s more\ninfluential view was both phenomenological and Darwinian: the\nunification of knowledge took the form of an analysis of ideas into\nbiologically embodied elementary sensations (neutral monism) and was\nultimately a matter of adaptive economy of thought. Planck adopted a\nrealist view that took science to gradually approach complete truth\nabout the world, and he fundamentally adopted the thermodynamical\nprinciples of energy and entropy (on the Mach-Planck debate see\nToulmin 1970). These world-pictures constituted some of the\nalternatives to a long-standing mechanistic view that, since the rise\nof mechanistic philosophy with Descartes and Newton, had informed\nbiology as well as most branches of physics. In the background was the\nperceived conflict between the so-called mechanical and\nelectromagnetic worldviews, which resulted throughout the first two\ndecades of the twentieth century in the work of Albert Einstein\n(Holton 1998).\n\nIn the same German tradition, and amidst the proliferation of work on\nenergy physics and books on unity of science, the German energeticist\nWilhelm Ostwald declared the twentieth century the \u201cMonistic\ncentury\u201d. During the 1904 World\u2019s Fair in St. Louis, the\nGerman psychologist and Harvard professor Hugo Munsterberg organized a\ncongress under the title \u201cUnity of Knowledge\u201d; invited\nspeakers were Ostwald, Ludwig Boltzmann, Ernest Rutherford, Edward\nLeamington Nichols, Paul Langevin and Henri Poincar\u00e9. In 1911,\nthe International Committee of Monism held its first meeting in\nHamburg, with Ostwald\n presiding.[1]\n Two years later it published Ostwald\u2019s monograph, Monism as\nthe Goal of Civilization. In 1912, Mach, Felix Klein, David\nHilbert, Einstein and others signed a manifesto aiming at the\ndevelopment of a comprehensive worldview. Unification remained a\ndriving scientific ideal. In the same spirit, Mathieu Leclerc du\nSablon published his L\u2019Unit\u00e9 de la Science\n(1919), exploring metaphysical foundations, and Johan Hjorst published\nThe Unity of Science (1921), sketching out a history of\nphilosophical systems and unifying scientific hypotheses.\n",
