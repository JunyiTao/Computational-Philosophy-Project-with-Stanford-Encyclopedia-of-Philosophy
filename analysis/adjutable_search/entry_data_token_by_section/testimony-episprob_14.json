    "main_text": "Authoritative Testimony\n5. Authoritative Testimony\n\nHere is a conversation that we might have:\n\n\nYou: This plant is Pacific Poison Oak. Don\u2019t touch it!\nMe: How do you know that?\nYou: Suneet told me. He lives in this area a knows a little bit\nabout plants.\n\n\n\nAnd here is another:\n\n\nYou: This plant is Pacific Poison Oak. Don\u2019t touch it!\nMe: How do you know that?\nYou: Margae told me. She has a PhD in plant biology and studies\nthis plant in particular.\n\n\n\nIn both cases you have acquired testimonial knowledge. But in the\nsecond case it seems like your belief is better off, epistemically\nspeaking. This is because in the first case your belief is based on\nthe testimony of a layman who is somewhat knowledgeable about the\ntopic at hand, whereas in the second case your belief is based on the\ntestimony of an epistemic authority (or, someone who is both\nyour epistemic superior and an expert about the domain in question).\n(See Zagzebski 2012; J\u00e4ger 2016; Croce 2018; and Constantin &\nGrundmann 2020 for more on how the notion of an epistemic authority\nshould be understood.)\n\nBut how exactly should the difference between epistemic authorities\nand everyone else be accounted for?\n\nBroadly speaking, those working on the epistemology of authoritative\ntestimony endorse one of two accounts: Preemptive Accounts\nand Non-Preemptive Accounts. Those who endorse a Preemptive\nAccount of authoritative testimony accept\n\n\nPreemption: The fact that an authority\u2026 [testifies]\nthat p is a reason for me to believe that p which\nreplaces my other reasons relevant to p and is not simply added\nto them. (Zagzebski 2012: 107)\n\n\nThe key idea here is that when you get testimony from an authority\nthat p, the authority\u2019s testimony is now the only reason\nthat you have for believing p, i.e., any other reasons you may\nhave had are now preempted in the sense that they no longer count for\nor against p. Proponents of the Preemptive Account, then,\nexplain the difference between authoritative and non-authoritative\ntestimony as follows: Authoritative testimony can provide you with a\npreemptive reason for belief, whereas non-authoritative testimony\ncannot. For defenses of various versions of the Preemptive Account,\nsee Zagzebski (2012, 2014, 2016), Keren (2007, 2014a, 2014b), Croce\n(2018) and Constantin and Grundmann (2020). See Anderson (2014),\nDougherty (2014), J\u00e4ger (2016), Dormandy (2018), and Lackey\n(2018a) for some worries with this view.\n\nThose who endorse a Non-Preemptive Account of authoritative testimony\nargue that Preemption has wildly unintuitive consequences, e.g., if\nPreemption is true, then you can be justified in believing your pastor\n(who is otherwise reliable) when he tells you that women are\ninherently inferior to men (see, e.g., Lackey 2018a). Instead of\nthinking about authoritative testimony as providing preemptive reasons\nfor belief, proponents of the Non-Preemptive Account take an\nauthority\u2019s testimony that p to provide a very strong\nreason to believe that p, where this reason is to be added to,\nor combined with, all of the other reasons that you have related to\nthe proposition in question. See Dormandy (2018) and Lackey (2018a)\nfor defenses of Non-Preemptive Accounts.\n\nFor related debates about testimony and expertise, see Hardwig\u2019s\n(1985) seminal paper on expert testimony in general, Alvin\nGoldman\u2019s (2001) paper on determining which experts to trust\nwhen there is disagreement amongst them, and Goldberg\u2019s (2009)\npaper that links issues in epistemology and philosophy of language by\ndiscussing how expert testimony bears on the semantics of technical\nterms. See also Kitcher (1993), Walton (1997), Brewer (1998) and\nGolanski (2001) for a discussion of expert testimony in the scientific\nsetting, and for discussion of expert testimony in a legal setting,\nsee Wells and Olson (2003).\n",
