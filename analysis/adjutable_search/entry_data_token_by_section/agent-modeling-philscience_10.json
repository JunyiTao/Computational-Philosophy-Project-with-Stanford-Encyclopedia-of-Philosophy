Common Modeling Frameworks\n\nWhen developing a model examining certain aspects of scientific\ninquiry, one first has to decide on a number of relevant\nrepresentational assumptions, such as: \n\nHow to represent the process of inquiry and evidence\ngathering? \nWhat do agents in the simulation stand for (e.g.,\nindividual scientists, research groups, scientific labs, etc.)? \nWhat are the units of appraisal in scientific inquiry\n(e.g., hypotheses, theories, research programs, methods, etc.)? \nHow do scientists reason and evaluate their units of\nappraisal? \nHow do scientists exchange information? \n\n\nSimilarly, if we wish to model a scenario in which scientists bargain\nabout the division of tasks or resources, we will have to decide how\nto represent their interactions and rewards they get\nout of them. These modeling choices are guided by the research\nquestion the model aims to tackle, as well as the epistemic aim of the\nmodel.\n\nThe majority of ABMs developed in philosophy of science are built as\nsimple and highly idealized models. The simpler a model is, the easier\nit is to understand and analyze mechanisms behind the results of\nsimulations (we return to this issue in\n Section 5).\n In this section, we delve into several common modeling frameworks\nthat have been used in this way. Each framework offers a different\ntake on the above representational choices and has served as the basis\nfor a variety of ABMs. Particular models will not be discussed just\nyet\u2014we leave this for\n Section 4.\n",
