    "main_text": "Model-Based Accounts of Measurement\n7. Model-Based Accounts of Measurement\n\nSince the early 2000s a new wave of philosophical scholarship has\nemerged that emphasizes the relationships between measurement and\ntheoretical and statistical modeling (Morgan 2001; Boumans 2005a,\n2015; Mari 2005b; Mari and Giordani 2013; Tal 2016, 2017; Parker 2017;\nMiyake 2017). According to model-based accounts, measurement consists\nof two levels: (i) a concrete process involving interactions between\nan object of interest, an instrument, and the environment; and (ii) a\ntheoretical and/or statistical model of that process, where\n\u201cmodel\u201d denotes an abstract and local representation\nconstructed from simplifying assumptions. The central goal of\nmeasurement according to this view is to assign values to one or more\nparameters of interest in the model in a manner that satisfies certain\nepistemic desiderata, in particular coherence and consistency.\n\nModel-based accounts have been developed by studying measurement\npractices in the sciences, and particularly in metrology. Metrology,\nofficially defined as the \u201cscience of measurement and its\napplication\u201d (JCGM 2012: 2.2), is a field of study concerned\nwith the design, maintenance and improvement of measuring instruments\nin the natural sciences and engineering. Metrologists typically work\nat standardization bureaus or at specialized laboratories that are\nresponsible for the calibration of measurement equipment, the\ncomparison of standards and the evaluation of measurement\nuncertainties, among other tasks. It is only recently that\nphilosophers have begun to engage with the rich conceptual issues\nunderlying metrological practice, and particularly with the inferences\ninvolved in evaluating and improving the accuracy of measurement\nstandards (Chang 2004; Boumans 2005a: Chap. 5, 2005b, 2007a; Frigerio\net al. 2010; Teller 2013, 2018; Riordan 2015; Schlaudt and Huber 2015;\nTal 2016a, 2018; Mitchell et al. 2017; M\u00f6\u00dfner and Nordmann\n2017; de Courtenay et al. 2019).\n\nA central motivation for the development of model-based accounts is\nthe attempt to clarify the epistemological principles underlying\naspects of measurement practice. For example, metrologists employ a\nvariety of methods for the calibration of measuring instruments, the\nstandardization and tracing of units and the evaluation of\nuncertainties (for a discussion of metrology, see the previous\nsection). Traditional philosophical accounts such as mathematical\ntheories of measurement do not elaborate on the assumptions, inference\npatterns, evidential grounds or success criteria associated with such\nmethods. As Frigerio et al. (2010) argue, measurement theory is\nill-suited for clarifying these aspects of measurement because it\nabstracts away from the process of measurement and focuses solely on\nthe mathematical properties of scales. By contrast, model-based\naccounts take scale construction to be merely one of several tasks\ninvolved in measurement, alongside the definition of measured\nparameters, instrument design and calibration, object sampling and\npreparation, error detection and uncertainty evaluation, among others\n(2010: 145\u20137).\n",
