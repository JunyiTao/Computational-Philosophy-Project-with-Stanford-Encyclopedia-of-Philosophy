    "main_text": "Rights and Reasons || Support among Rights\n5.3 Support among Rights\n\nPhilosophers have discussed not only how rights can conflict, but how\nthey sometimes support one another. For example, Henry Shue has argued\nthat both rights of security and rights of subsistence are\n\u201cbasic rights\u201d because they are indispensable for the full\nenjoyment of all other rights\u2014while other rights are non-basic\nbecause they are not indispensable for the enjoyment of these two. If\nthe enjoyment or realization of a controversial right is an important\nprecondition for the enjoyment of an uncontroversial right, one can\ndefend the controversial right by documenting its strong supporting\nrole. Such a \u201clinkage argument\u201d is used by Shue to defend\nthe right to subsistence as a basic right, and by Sen to defend rights\nto democracy and freedom of the press as supportive of the right to\nadequate nutrition in developing countries (Shue 1996, Sen 1999).\nShue\u2019s and Sen\u2019s assertions have been criticized as\nexaggerated (Nickel 2008, Myhvold-Hanssen 2003 (in the Other Internet\nResources)).\n\nNickel (2008, 2010, 2016) develops a sophisticated typology of\nsupporting relations between rights (see also Gilabert 2010). One\nright strongly supports another when it is logically or practically\ninconsistent to endorse the implementation of the second right without\nendorsing the simultaneous implementation of the first. For example,\nthe right to bodily security strongly supports the right to freedom of\nassembly. One right weakly supports another when it is useful but not\nessential to it. The right to education, for example, weakly supports\nthe right to a fair trial. Nickel argues that the strength of\nsupporting relations between rights varies with quality of\nimplementation. Poorly implemented rights provide little support to\nother rights, while ones that are more effectively implemented tend to\nprovide greater support to other rights. The right to due process\nsupports the right to equal treatment for members of different racial\nand ethnic groups\u2014but the support will be soft if the right to\ndue process is only weakly implemented.\n\nRights that weakly support each other are interdependent. Rights that\nstrongly support each other are indivisible. Beginning with the 1968\nProclamation of Tehran, the United Nations has promoted the idea that\n\u201cSince human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible,\nthe full realization of civil and political rights without the\nenjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights is impossible\u201d\n(see Whelan 2010). Nickel holds that this indivisibility thesis\nexaggerates the density and strength of supporting relations among\nhuman rights. He allows, however, that many supporting relations exist\nbetween rights\u2014particularly under high-quality\nimplementation\u2014and endorses the use of linkage arguments when\nindispensability can be shown.\n",
