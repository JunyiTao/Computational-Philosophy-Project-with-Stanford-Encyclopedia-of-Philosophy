    "main_text": "Principles of Equality and Justice || Formal Equality\n2.1 Formal Equality\n\nWhen two persons have equal status in at least one normatively\nrelevant respect, they must be treated equally with regard in this\nrespect. This is the generally accepted formal equality\nprinciple that Aristotle articulated in reference to Plato:\n\u201ctreat like cases as like\u201d (Aristotle, Nicomachean\nEthics, V.3. 1131a10\u2013b15; Politics, III.9.1280 a8\u201315,\nIII. 12. 1282b18\u201323). The crucial question is which respects are\nnormatively relevant and which are not. Some authors see this formal\nprinciple of equality as a specific application of a rule of\nrationality: it is irrational, because inconsistent, to treat equal\ncases unequally without sufficient reasons (Berlin 1955\u201356). But\nothers claim that what is at stake here is a moral principle of\njustice, one reflecting the impartial and universalizable nature of\nmoral judgments. On this view, the postulate of formal equality\ndemands more than consistency with one\u2019s subjective preferences: the\nequal or unequal treatment in question must be justifiable to the\nrelevantly affected parties, and this on the sole basis of a\nsituation\u2019s objective features.\n",
