    "main_text": "What Makes a Separation Problematic? || An Alternative Criterion\n4.3 An Alternative Criterion\n\nAs already noted, this benchmark\u2014by which candidate separations\nare assessed as problematic or not\u2014is often, but not always,\nplayed by accounts of our essential human nature. Given the widespread\ncontemporary suspicion of such accounts\u2014not least, by those\nopposed to what is sometimes called \u2018essentialism\u2019 about\nhuman nature\u2014it might be helpful to sketch a recent account\nof alienation which is not dependent on such assumptions (or, at\nleast, consciously strives to avoid them). There is also a potential\nbenefit here for those of us who do not fully share that suspicion,\nnamely, that such an example might provide some sense of the\ndiversity of available theories of alienation.\n\nRahel Jaeggi offers an account of alienation of this kind, and\nsituates it explicitly in the tradition of Critical Theory \u2013 the kind\nof emancipatory theory associated with the Frankfurt School. On this\naccount, the idea of alienation has the potential to help us\nunderstand and change the world, but only if it receives some\nsignificant conceptual reconstruction. Alienation is still associated\nwith the frustration of freedom, with disruptions to something like\n\u2018self-realisation\u2019. However, this account\u2014unlike its\nforerunners and associates\u2014is said not to be fatally compromised\nby a commitment to either \u2018strongly objectivistic\u2019\ntheories of the good life or \u2018essentialist\u2019 conceptions of\nthe self (Jaeggi 2014: 40).\n\nThe crucial term of art here is \u2018appropriation\u2019, which\nJaeggi uses to refer to the capacity for, and process of, relating to\nour own actions and projects in ways which engage \u2018something\nlike self-determination and being the author of one\u2019s own\nlife\u2019  (2014: 39). Appropriation is successful\u2014and\nalienation is absent\u2014when \u2018one is present in one\u2019s\nactions, steers one\u2019s life instead of being driven by it,\nindependently appropriates social roles and is able to identify with\none\u2019s desires, and is involved in the world\u2019 (Jaeggi 2014:\n155). In contrast, appropriation is unsuccessful\u2014and alienation\nis present\u2014when there is \u2018an inadequate power and a lack\nof presence in what one does, a failure to identify with one\u2019s\nown actions and desires and to take part in one\u2019s own\nlife\u2019 (Jaeggi 2014: 155). Alienation is thus identified with\nsystematic disruptions of the process of appropriation \u2013 in particular,\nin those systematic disruptions which lead us to fail to experience\nour actions and projects as our own. These disruptions are said\ntypically to take one of four forms: first,\n\u2018powerlessness\u2019 or the experience of losing control over\none\u2019s own life; second, \u2018loss of authenticity\u2019\nespecially when one is unable to identify with one\u2019s own social\nroles; third, \u2018internal division\u2019 where one experiences\nsome of one\u2019s own desires and impulses as alien; and fourth,\n\u2018indifference\u2019 or a detachment from one\u2019s own\nprevious projects and self-understandings.\n\nThis model fits happily enough with our basic idea of alienation as\nconsisting in a  problematic separation between self and other\nthat belong together. However, the conditions for identifying\nthe relevant dysfunctional relation here are intended to be less\ndemanding and controversial than those involving claims about our\nessential human nature. There is a kindred notion of freedom as\nself-realisation, but it is said to be the realisation of a thin kind\nof self-determining agency and not the actualisation of some thick\n\u2018pre-given\u2019 identity of an essentialist sort. A normative\ndimension remains, but it is presented as expansive and broadly\nprocedural. It is expansive in that a wide range of actions and\nprojects might be included within its remit. And it is procedural in\nthat the benchmark for judging the success of these various actions\nand projects is that they were brought about in the right kind of\nself-determination delivering way, and not that their content reflects\na narrow and controversial account of what human beings are \u2018in\nessence\u2019.\n\nModern culture is said to recognise and value the kind of freedom at\nthe heart of this picture of appropriation. As a result, this account\nof alienation can be presented as a form of immanent\ncritique \u2013 that is, as utilising a standpoint which judges\nindividuals and forms of life according to standards that those\nindividuals have themselves propounded or which those forms of life\npresuppose. At the individual level, this critique might involve\nidentifying potential tensions between the conditions for treating\npeople as responsible agents, and the obstructions to such agency that\ncharacterise alienated selves \u2013 for instance, the feelings of\npowerlessness that prevent individuals from directing and embracing\ntheir own lives. And at the social level, this critique might involve\nidentifying potential discrepancies between modern ideals of freedom\nand their actual realisation in the contemporary world \u2013 for instance,\nthe existence of social or political roles that an individual can\nnever make their own (Jaeggi 2014: 41\u201342).\n\nOf course, there remain questions about this account, and three are\nbroached here. First, one might doubt whether the contrast between\nessentialist accounts of human nature, on the one hand, and a thinner\nkind of self-governing agency, on the other, can either be sustained\nor play the role intended. Second, one might wonder about the\nground(s) of normativity; after all, that the kind of subjectivity or\nself-determination which appropriation embodies is recognised and\nvalued in modern culture does not in itself establish its ethical\nworth. (More generally, it can seem easier to dismiss Hegelian\nteleology, or Marxist perfectionism, than it is to find wholly\nsatisfactory replacements for them.) Third, one might be sceptical\nabout the degree of social criticism here, since both the sources of,\nand solutions to, Jaeggi\u2019s paradigmatic examples of\nunsuccessful appropriation (\u2018powerless\u2019, \u2018loss\nof authenticity\u2019, \u2018internal division\u2019,\nand \u2018indifference\u2019) seem to focus on the\n\u2018thoughts and dispositions\u2019 of individuals rather than the\nstructures of particular societies (Haverkamp 2016, 69). Of course,\nthere might be plausible responses to these critical worries, some\nof which could draw on Jaeggi\u2019s own subsequent work\n(see espcially 2018). \n",
