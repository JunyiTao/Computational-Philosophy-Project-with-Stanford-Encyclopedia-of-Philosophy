Mental Faculties and Mental Representation\n\nOne of the goals of Kant\u2019s critical philosophy is to articulate\nthe conditions of the possibility of what he calls\n\u201cexperience\u201d (Erfahrung). As we\u2019ll see\nbelow, Kant\u2019s use of the term is rather more technical than is\ntypically meant in English by talk of, e.g., a subject\u2019s\n\u201cexperience\u201d of the color red. Indeed, Kant sometimes\nspeaks of there being only a single or universal experience (A110,\nA493/B521), which at least strongly suggests that he is not construing\nexperience in a purely subjective or phenomenological manner. Rather,\nin talking of the conditions of \u201cexperience\u201d in this way,\nKant is most obviously concerned with the conditions under which\nobjective empirical knowledge is possible\u2014including knowledge\nthat Kant\u2019s thinks we actually have, such as is exemplified in\nthe sciences of mathematics and physics. Kant\u2019s hope is that by\narticulating the conditions under which such knowledge is possible, he\nwill be able to indicate how it is that metaphysics itself could\nbecome a science. He pursues this goal via an examination of those\nfeatures of the mind relevant to the conditions of\n\u201cexperience\u201d so construed. This amounts to an examination\nof the conditions for \u201ccognition\u201d (Erkenntnis),\nor the mind\u2019s \u201crelation to an object\u201d (B137). There\nis some controversy about the best way to understand Kant\u2019s use\nof this phrase, but for the moment we\u2019ll understand it as\ninvolving relation to a possible object of experience, and as being a\nnecessary condition for the positive substantive knowledge\n(Wissen) characteristic of a proper science (i.e., a\nWissenschaft).\n\nAt the most basic explanatory level, Kant conceives of the mind as\nconstituted by two fundamental capacities (F\u00e4higkeiten),\nor powers, which he labels \u201creceptivity\u201d\n(Receptivit\u00e4t) and \u201cspontaneity\u201d\n(Spontaneit\u00e4t). Receptivity, as the name suggests,\nconstitutes the mind\u2019s capacity to be affected, whether by\nitself (i.e., one \u201cpart\u201d or capacity of the mind affecting\nanother) or something else (i.e., something distinct from the mind).\nFor Kant, any exercise of the mind\u2019s receptive power essentially\nrequires some external prompting in order to engage in the production\nof representations. In contrast, the power of spontaneity needs no\nsuch prompting. It is able to initiate its activity from itself,\nwithout any external influence.\n\nKant thus construes all mental activity either in terms of its\nresulting from affection (receptivity) or from the mind\u2019s\nself-prompted activity (spontaneity). From these two very general\naspects of the mind Kant then derives three basic cognitive faculties\n(Verm\u00f6gen), termed by Kant \u201csensibility\u201d\n(Sinnlichkeit), \u201cunderstanding\u201d\n(Verstand), and \u201creason\u201d (Vernunft).\nThese faculties characterize specific cognitive powers, none of which\nis reducible to any of the others, and to each of which is assigned a\nparticular cognitive task and a specific kind of characteristic\nrepresentational output. In the case of sensibility the characteristic\nrepresentations are sensation (Empfindung) and intuition\n(Anschauung). In the case of the understanding and reason (or\nthe \u2018intellect\u2019 more broadly), concepts\n(Begriffe), judgment (Urteil), and inference\n(Schlu\u00df).\n\nKant characterizes intuition in terms of two basic\ncharacteristics\u2014viz. immediacy (Unmittelbarkeit) and\nparticularity (Einzelheit) (cf. A19/B33, A68/B93; JL 9:91).\nThis is in contrast to the mediacy and generality\n(Allgemeinheit) characteristic of conceptual representation\n(A68/B93; JL 9:91). Kant\u2019s distinction between these two sorts\nof representation might at first pass be taken as a kind of\nphenomenological distinction between how things seem to a perceiving\nsubject independently of thought about what is so experienced, and\nthis is indeed how at least some interpreters have construed Kant\n(e.g., Prichard 1909; Russell 1913; Broad 1978; Parsons 1992b).\nHowever, as others have noted (e.g., Paton 1936: 98), Kant\u2019s\nmethod for distinguishing the various contributions made by our\ncognitive faculties proceeds not by appeal to phenomenology but rather\nphilosophical abstraction (e.g., A20-1/B34-5). Moreover, Kant at least\nsometimes seems to deny that a representation (or its content) could\nbe present to consciousness at all\u2014i.e., be something\n\u201cfor\u201d the subject\u2014without conceptualization (e.g.,\nA116-17, B132). Hence Kant seems concerned not so much with the\nphenomenology of conceptual vs. non-conceptual experience as he is\nwith the role sense experience plays in facilitating cognition and\nknowledge.\n\nIn discursive rational beings such as ourselves, intuition and concept\ncooperate in the generation of what Kant calls\n\u201ccognition\u201d. Kant employs the term \u201ccognition\u201d\n(Erkenntnis) in different ways (Smit 2000, 2009; Schafer\nforthcoming-a, forthcoming-b; Gomes and Stephenson 2016; Tolley 2020;\nWillaschek and Watkins 2020; Watkins and Willaschek 2017b). In the\n\u2018Stepladder\u2019 passage from the first Critique Kant\nprovides a very general definition of cognition as a conscious\nrepresentation of an object (A320/B376; see also JL 9:91). In this\nsense both intuitions and concepts may be cognitions. Kant also has a\nnarrower sense of cognition \u201cin the proper sense\u201d\n(A78/B103), which in finite discursive beings like us concerns only\nthose states that are the outcome of a synthesis of concepts and an\nintuited manifold. Proper cognition satisfies three conditions: (i)\nconsciousness; (ii) \u201cagreement\u201d\n(\u00dcbereinstimmung) or truth-aptness; (iii) real\npossibility. The consciousness condition is clearly stated in\nKant\u2019s \u201cStepladder\u201d passage. Cognition must be a\nconscious relation to an object. Kant indicates the\n\u201cagreement\u201d or \u201cconformity\u201d\n(\u00dcbereinstimmung) of a cognition with its object in his\ndiscussion of truth in the first Critique. He says that the\n\u201cnominal definition of truth, namely that it is the agreement of\ncognition with its object, is here granted and presupposed\u201d\n(A58/B82). Since Kant allows for false cognition, his view must be\nthat representations that are cognitions are such as to be\nable to agree or conform with their objects, and Kant construes\nsuch agreement as truth. Kant regards judgment (i.e., a specific sort\nof non-associative unity of concepts) as the bearer of truth, while\ndenying that intuition is the sort of thing that can be true or false\n(see Heis 2013: 277\u20138; McLear 2016b). Finally, Kant construes\ncognition as always needing to be of a really\u2014i.e.,\nmetaphysically\u2014possible subject matter. As Kant states in a\nfamous footnote in the B-preface of the first Critique:\n\n\nTo cognize an object, it is required that I be able to prove\nits possibility (whether by the testimony of experience from its\nactuality or a priori through reason). (Bxxvin.)\n\n\nProper cognition may be pure, as when synthesizing a manifold of pure\nintuition (e.g., the pure intuition of space or time) with a concept\n(e.g., the concept of space as discussed in the Metaphysical\nExposition of Space in the Transcendental Aesthetic). Proper cognition\nmay also be empirical, as when synthesizing an empirical intuition\n(e.g., of touch or vision) with a concept. Kant often describes\nempirical cognition as \u201cexperience\u201d (Erfahrung;\nsee, e.g., B166, A176/B218, A189/B234), though empirical intuition and\nconcepts are also related in what Kant calls \u201cperception\u201d\n(Wahrnehmung).\n\nKant takes the terms \u201cintuition\u201d (Anschauung),\n\u201cperception\u201d (Wahrnehmung), and\n\u201cexperience\u201d (Erfahrung) to designate different\nthings (McLear 2014b: 771\u2013772; Allais 2016: 2\u20135; Tolley\n2016a: 86\u201391, 2019, 2020). For example, in the headings to the\nfirst three chapters of the Principles of the first Critique\nKant distinguishes between the \u201cAxioms of Intuition,\u201d the\n\u201cAnticipations of Perception,\u201d and the \u201cAnalogies of\nExperience.\u201d If Kant weren\u2019t thinking that the terms\n\u201cintuition\u201d, \u201cperception\u201d, and\n\u201cexperience\u201d designated distinct mental states, then it\nwould be difficult to understand why he ordered a central part of his\narchitectonic around them. All three are forms of representation of\nobjects. Insofar as each is a conscious representations of an object\nthey are all forms of \u201ccognition\u201d in the broad (though not\nnecessarily the \u201cproper\u201d) sense of that term. Let\u2019s\nlook at each representational kind in a bit more detail.\n\nIntuition is a relation to an \u201cundetermined\u201d\n(unbestimmt) object or an \u201cappearance\u201d\n(Erscheinung). Kant uses this phrase to characterize the\nobject of intuition both in the opening of the Transcendental\nAesthetic (A20/B34) in the first Critique, and in later\ndiscussion in both the Analytic (A69/B94, B154, B163, A141/B180, B309)\nand the Dialectic (A310/B367, B422n, A443/B471, A718/B746)). Though\ninterpretation of these texts is controversial, the sense in which the\nobject of intuition is \u201cundetermined\u201d seems to\nspecifically involve its lack of conceptual determination,\neither explicitly in judgment (see, e.g., A69/B94) or via a rule of\n\u201cfigurative\u201d synthesis that guides the imagination (e.g.,\nA141/B180).\n\nPerception, like intuition, is also sometimes described as\nrepresentation of an undetermined object (e.g., B422n). However,\nperception also involves a consciousness of the \u201cmanifold\u201d\nor \u201ccontent\u201d (Inhalt; more on this notion of\n\u201ccontent\u201d below) of the intuition (A99, A119\u201320,\nB160, B162, B202\u20133; Pr 4:300). What Kant means by this is not\nentirely obvious. However, Kant is clear that perception necessarily\nrequires the activity of the imagination in combining together the\ncontent of the intuition into what Kant calls an \u201cimage\u201d\n(Bild), which yields or constitutes consciousness of the\ncontent of intuition itself (A120, B160; see Sellars 1978; Young 1988;\nAllison 2015: 254\u2013264; Matherne 2015; Tolley 2019, 2020). Kant\nalso indicates that in perception the \u201cmathematical\u201d\ncategories of quality and quantity are employed, though not the\nrelational or modal categories, which are constitutive of experience\nonly (A161-2/B201; see Allison 2015: 414\u2013426).\n\nFinally, \u201cexperience\u201d (Erfahrung) involves the\ncombination or \u201csynthesis\u201d of these perceptions\n(Wahrnehmungen) by the categories, particularly the\ncategories of relation (i.e., substance, cause, community). As Kant\nputs it, \u201cexperience is cognition through connected perceptions\n(durch verkn\u00fcpfte Wahrnehmungen)\u201d (B161; cf. B218;\nPr 4:300). Experience is thus the most cognitively demanding and\nsophisticated form of having a cognitive relation to an object.\n\nGiven these distinctions we\u2019ll next look at how to understand\nthe proper locus of debate concerning the intellect\u2019s\ncontribution to sense experience.\n",
