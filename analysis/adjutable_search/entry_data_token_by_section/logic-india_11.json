    "main_text": "Culmination of the Classical Period || Dign\u0101ga\n4.2 Dign\u0101ga\u2019s contemporaries and immediate successors\n\nHowever much scholars may disagree about Dign\u0101ga\u2019s aim in\nthe formulation of the canonical syllogism, all agree that his works\nset the framework within which subsequent Buddhist thinkers addressed\nphilosophical issues pertaining to inference and debate. Thus,\n\u015aa\u1e47karasv\u0101min (c. 6th century ce),\na pupil of Dign\u0101ga (Frauwallner 1961,\n140), wrote a brief manual of inference for Buddhists, called the\nNy\u0101ya-prave\u015ba (Beginning logic), based\ndirectly on Dign\u0101ga\u2019s work. Not long thereafter,\nDharmak\u012brti (c. 7th century ce), the\ngreat Buddhist metaphysician, also elaborated his views on inference\nand debate within the framework found in Dign\u0101ga.\n\nThe canonical syllogism, treated as an inference, is that whereby one\nwho knows the truth of its premisses may also come to know the truth\nof its conclusion. While the truth of a particular statement is\nthought to be known either through perception or through inference,\nhow is the truth of a universal statement, such as the major premiss\nof a canonical syllogism, known? To know its truth would seem to\nrequire that one know of each thing which has H, whether or not it\nalso has S. Yet if one knew that, one would already know by perception\nthe canonical syllogism\u2019s conclusion. As a result, inference\nwould be a superfluous means of knowledge.\n\nThe earliest classical Indian philosopher thought to have recognized\nthe problem of how one comes to know the truth of a universal\nstatement seems to have been \u012a\u015bvarasena (Steinkellner 1997\np. 638). He appears to have thought that knowledge of the major\npremiss is grounded in non-perception (anupalabdhi). That is,\naccording to \u012a\u015bvarasena, knowledge that whatever has H has S\ncomes from the simple failure to perceive something which has H but\nwhich does not have S. (See Steinkellner 1993, where he draws on\nSteinkellner 1966.)\n\nHowever, this suggestion does not solve the problem, for reasons laid\nout in detail by Dharmak\u012brti (c. 7th century ce).\nHis extensive writing on epistemology in\ngeneral and on reason and argument in particular formed a watershed in\nclassical India philosophy. Besides his magnum opus,\nPram\u0101\u1e47a-v\u0101rttika (Gloss on the means of\nepistemic cognition), one of whose four chapters is devoted to\ninference (sv\u0101rtha-anum\u0101na), comprising 340 verses\nand a commentary by him to it, and another devoted to argument\n(par\u0101rtha-anum\u0101na), which comprises 285 verses, he\nwrote several smaller works, including\nPram\u0101\u1e47a-vini\u015bcaya (Settling on what the\nepistemic means of cognition are), Ny\u0101ya-bindu\n(Drop of logic), Hetu-bindu (Drop of\nreason) and V\u0101da-ny\u0101ya (Logic of\ndebate). As he makes abundantly clear in verses 13\u201325 and\nhis commentary thereto of the chapter on inference\n(sv\u0101rtha-anum\u0101na) of his\nPram\u0101\u1e47a-v\u0101rttika, the simple failure to\nperceive something which has H but which does not have S is no\nguarantee that whatever has H has S; after all, while one has never\nencountered something which has H and does not have S, what guarantee\nis there that something which has H and does not have S is not among\nthe things which one has yet to encounter? Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s\nanswer was that the truth of the first premiss is guaranteed by either\nof two relations obtaining between properties: the causation relation\n(tadutpatti) and the identity relation\n(t\u0101d\u0101tmya). Unfortunately, as one might suspect,\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s solution does not work. (See Gillon 1991; see\nSteinkellner 2015 for a dissenting view.)\n\nStarting with Dign\u0101ga, those interested in logic started to add\nthe particle eva to the various clauses of the three forms of\nreason (tri-r\u016bpa-hetu) (Katsura 1986).\nDign\u0101ga\u2019s formulation of the three forms came in for\ncriticism at the hands of the Ny\u0101ya thinker, Uddyotakara (c. late\n6th century ce), which was, in turn, addressed\nby Dharmak\u012brti, who uses the particle to express each of the\nthree conditions (NB 2.5).\n\nthree forms of reason (tri-r\u016bpa-hetu)\n\n\n\nfirst form:\nthe reason\u2019s definite (eva) existence in the\nsubject; \n\nsecond form:\nthe reason\u2019s existence in subject-like things only\n(eva); \n\nthird form:\nthe reason\u2019s utter (eva) non-existence in\nsubject-unlike things.  \n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the precision hoped for is undermined by the ambiguity\nin the meaning of the particle eva. The particle eva\nhas two principal uses: one emphatic, the other restrictive. What it\nemphasizes or restricts depends on the word after which it is placed.\nThe particle in the statement of the first form applies to the\nabstract noun existence and, in its emphatic use, is well\ntranslated by definite or actual. The particle in\nthe statement of the third form applies to the negative abstract noun\nnon-existence and, in its emphatic use with negation, is best\ntranslated by utter or at all. (Some scholars\ntranslate the particle in these statements as necessary.\nThere is, however, no philological justification for such a\ntranslation.) The particle in the second form applies to a concrete\nnoun. Though here the particle could have either an emphatic or a\nrestrictive use, only the restrictive use fits the context. A problem\narises from the word subject-like (sa-pak\u1e63a).\nIt can be construed in two ways: either as including or as excluding\nthe subject. If subject-like is construed as inclusive and\nthe particle eva is taken as restrictive, then the second and\nthird forms are logically equivalent; but the statement of the three\nforms has the rhetorical blemish of containing a logically superfluous\nform. If subject-like is taken as exclusive and the particle\nis taken as restrictive, then the three forms are inconsistent, for in\nthat case the second form entails the contradictory of the first form.\n(For details, see Gillon 1999.)\n\nIdeas on the nature of reasoning and argumentation very similar to\nthose of Dign\u0101ga\u2019s are found in the\nPad\u0101rtha-dharma-sa\u1e43graha (Summary of\ncategories and properties), a work better known as\nPra\u015bastap\u0101da-bh\u0101\u1e63ya\n(Pra\u015bastap\u0101da\u2019s commentary, customarily\nregarded as a commentary on the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra). Its author,\nPra\u015bastap\u0101da (c. 6th century ce), is\na near contemporary of Dign\u0101ga. Like Dign\u0101ga,\nPra\u015bastap\u0101da uses the expression inference for\nanother (par\u0101rtha-anum\u0101na) to refer to\narguments cast in a syllogistic form, thereby making clear his\nrecognition that inferences, or cognitive processes, and arguments, or\nverbal expressions, are two sides of the same coin. Also like\nDign\u0101ga, Pra\u015bastap\u0101da adopts as a canonical syllogism\nan argument whose core is the same deductively valid argument as\nDign\u0101ga\u2019s. However, unlike Dign\u0101ga, he retains the\nfive members for the syllogism, in keeping with the five members of\nthe analogical syllogism set out by V\u0101tsy\u0101yana, though some\nof the names for the members are different. The following syllogism is\nreassembled from Pra\u015bastap\u0101da\u2019s treatment of\ninference. (See Randle 1930 p. 176.)\n\ncanonical syllogism (deductively valid):\nPra\u015bastap\u0101da\n\n\n\nproposition:\nWind is a substance [266] \n\nreason:\nbecause it possesses action. [268] \n\nexample:\nThat which possesses movement is observed to be a substance,\nlike an arrow. [278] \n\napplication:\nAnd in the same way wind possesses action. [281] \n\nconclusion:\nTherefore, it is indeed a substance. [282]  \n\n\n\n(The numbers above in square brackets refer to the paragraph numbers\nof the passages containing the relevant sentences in Bronkhorst and\nRamseier (eds.) 1994.) Again, like Dign\u0101ga,\nPra\u015bastap\u0101da appeals to the same three conditions to define\na proper reason as those used in the three forms of a reason. And\nfinally, he identifies and classifies specious reasons in terms of the\nfailure of a reason to satisfy one or other of the three forms.\n\nThe question of whether the deductively valid canonical syllogism\nspread from Dign\u0101ga to Pra\u015bastap\u0101da, or from\nPra\u015bastap\u0101da to Dign\u0101ga, or from some other person to\nthe two of them both has yet to be decided. Whatever the answer is to\nthis question, it is clear that a deductively valid version of the\ncanonical syllogism came to be adopted virtually by every classical\nIndian thinker and that it made its way to China, Korea and Japan\nthrough the spread of Buddhism.\n\nIt was not long before the ideas pertaining to the canonical syllogism\nbecame generally accepted not only by other non-Brahmanical thinkers,\nsuch as the Jains, but also by Brahmanical thinkers. For example, the\nJain thinker, Jinabhadra (6th ce), a junior\ncontemporary of Dign\u0101ga, wrote a commentary on the Jain thinker\nBhadrab\u0101hu where he took claims in the latter\u2019s work and\nrecast them in the form of the canonical argument as found in\nDign\u0101ga\u2019s work (Uno 2009). In addition, one finds that the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101 thinker Kum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da\n(c. early 7th century ce) adopted, without\nspecial comment, a deductively valid version of the canonical\nsyllogism. His thoughts on the matter are developed at length in the\none hundred eighty-eight verses of his\n\u015aloka-v\u0101rttika\u2019s (Gloss in verses)\nAnum\u0101na-pariccheda (Section on inference). At\nthe same time, though the Ny\u0101ya thinker Uddyotakara argued\nvigorously against many of Dign\u0101ga\u2019s views, he nonetheless\nadvocated a version of the canonical syllogism which is deductively\nvalid.\n\nIn spite of the metaphysical differences which distinguished the\nvarious schools of thought, both Buddhist and Brahmanical, all\nthinkers came to use a naive realist\u2019s ontology to specify the\nstates of affairs in connection with the canonical syllogism.\nAccording to this view, the world consists of individual substances,\nor things (dravya), universals (s\u0101m\u0101nya)\nand relations between them. The fundamental relation is the one of\noccurrence (v\u1e5btti). The relata of this relation are\nknown as substratum (dharmin) and superstratum\n(dharma) respectively. The relation has two forms: contact\n(sa\u1e43yoga) and inherence (samav\u0101ya). So,\nfor example, one individual substance, a pot, may occur on another,\nsay the reason, by the relation of contact. In this case, the pot is\nthe superstratum and the reason is the substratum. Or, a universal,\nsay treeness, may occur in an individual substance, say an individual\ntree, by the relation of inherence. Here, treeness, the superstratum,\ninheres in the individual tree, the substratum. The converse of the\nrelation of occurrence is the relation of possession. In addition, the\nrelation of pervasion (vy\u0101pti), or what had also been\nreferred to as the relation of indispensability\n(a-vin\u0101-bh\u0101va), can also be defined in terms of the\noccurrence relation: one superstratum pervades another just in case\nwherever the second occurs the first occurs. The converse of the\npervasion relation is the concomitance relation (anvaya) and\nits contrapositive is exclusion (vyatireka). As a result of\nthese relations, the world embodies a structure: if one superstratum,\ndesignated as H, is concomitant with another superstratum, designated\nas S, and if a particular substratum, say p, possesses the former\nsuperstratum, then it possesses the second. This structure is the one\nwhich underlies the classical Indian canonical syllogism.\n\nThough the canonical syllogism is central to the development of\nreflection on argument and reasoning in preclassical and classical\nIndia, other forms of argument were also recognized as good. One form,\nas mentioned above, is reductio ad absurdum\n(prasa\u1e45ga). Others include suppositional reasoning\n(tarka) (Bagchi 1953) and a form of reasoning akin to what\ncontemporaries would call disjunctive syllogism\n(arth\u0101patti) (Keating (ed.) 2020). At the same time,\nthere are forms of argument, different from the fallacious rejoinders\nand specious reasons, which were also regarded as bad. They include\narguments which lead to an infinite regress (anavasth\u0101),\nmentioned above, as well as various forms of circularity. Finally,\nthere are two important forms of argument: one peculiar to Buddhists,\nknown as the tetralemma (catu\u1e63ko\u1e6di), and the\nother peculiar to the Jains (sy\u0101dv\u0101da).\n",
