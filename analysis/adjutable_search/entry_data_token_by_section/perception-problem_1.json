    "main_text": "The Problem of Perception\n2. The Problem of Perception\n\nThe Problem of Perception is that if illusions and hallucinations are\npossible, then perceptual experience, as we ordinarily understand it,\nis impossible. The Problem is animated by two central arguments: the\nargument from illusion (\u00a72.1) and the argument from hallucination\n(\u00a72.2). (A similar problem arises with reference to other\nperceptual phenomena such as perspectival variation or conflicting\nappearances: see Burnyeat (1979) and the entry on sense-data). For\nsome classic readings on these arguments, see Moore (1905, 1910);\nRussell (1912); Price (1932); Broad (1965); and Ayer (1940), see\nSwartz (1965) for a good collection of readings. And for more recent\nexpositions see Snowdon (1992), Valberg (1992), Robinson (1994:\nChapter 2), Smith (2002: Chapters 1 and 7), Martin (2006), Fish (2009:\nChapter 2), Brewer (2011: Chapter 1) and Pautz (2021).\n\nThe two central arguments have a similar structure which we can\ncapture as follows:\n\nIn an illusory/hallucinatory experience, a subject is not directly\npresented with an ordinary object.\nThe same account of experience must apply to veridical experiences\nas applies to illusory/hallucinatory experiences.\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nSubjects are never directly presented with ordinary objects.\n\n\n(C) contradicts Direct Realist Presentation, and thus our ordinary\nconception of perceptual experience. And since Direct Realism seems to\nfollow from Direct Realist Presentation, the argument challenges\nDirect Realism too (for more on this see\n \u00a73.2.6).\n\nRepresenting the arguments in this basic form enables us to highlight\ntheir two major movements; what Paul Snowdon calls the base case, and\nthe spreading step (1992, 2005). In the base case a conclusion about\njust illusory/hallucinatory experiences is sought: (A). In the\nspreading step, (B), this result is generalised so as to get (C). This\ngeneralising move works on these background assumptions: (a1) that (B)\nyields the claim that one is not directly presented with ordinary\nobjects in veridical experiences (given (A)), and (a2) if one is not\ndirectly presented with such objects in even veridical experiences,\none never is.\n\nWe\u2019ll look at more complex versions of the argument shortly. As\nwe\u2019ll see, the main burden on the arguer from illusion is in\nsupporting the relevant version of (A), whereas the main burden on the\narguer from hallucination is in defending the relevant version of\n(B).\n\nNow, the argument here is purely negative. But many philosophers have\nmoved from this to the further conclusion that since we are always\ndirectly presented with something in perceptual experience, what we\nare presented with is a \u201cnon-ordinary\u201d object (see\n \u00a73.1.2).\n",
