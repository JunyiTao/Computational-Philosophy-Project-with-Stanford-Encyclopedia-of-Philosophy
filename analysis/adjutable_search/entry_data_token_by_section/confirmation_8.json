    "main_text": "Bayesian confirmation theories\n3. Bayesian confirmation theories\n\nBayes\u2019s theorem is a very central element of the\nprobability calculus (see Joyce 2019). For historical reasons,\nBayesian has become a standard label to allude to a range of\napproaches and positions sharing the common idea that probability (in\nits modern, mathematical sense) plays a crucial role in rational\nbelief, inference, and behavior. According to Bayesian epistemologists\nand philosophers of science, (i) rational agents have credences\ndiffering in strength, which moreover (ii) satisfy the probability\naxioms, and can thus be represented in probabilistic form. (In\nnon-Bayesian models (ii) is rejected, but (i) may well be retained:\nsee Huber and Schmidt-Petri 2009, Levi 2008, and Spohn 2012.)\nWell-known arguments exist in favor of this position (see, e.g.,\nEaswaran 2011a; Pettigrew 2016; Skyrms 1987; Vineberg 2016), although\nthere is no lack of difficulties and criticism (see, e.g., Easwaran\n2011b; H\u00e1jek 2008; Kelly and Glymour 2004; Norton 2011b).\n\nBeyond the core ideas above, however, the theoretical landscape of\nBayesianism is quite as hopelessly diverse as it is fertile. Surveys\nand state of art presentations are already numerous, and ostensibly\ngrowing (see, e.g., Good 1971; Joyce 2011; Oaksford and Chater 2007;\nSprenger and Hartmann 2020; Weisberg 2015). For the present purposes,\nattention can be restricted to a classification that is still fairly\ncoarse-grained, and based on just two dimensions or criteria.\n\nFirst, there is a distinction between permissivism and\nimpermissivism (see Meacham 2014 and Kopec and Titelbaum 2016\nfor this terminology). For permissive Bayesians (often otherwise\nlabelled \u201csubjectivists\u201d), accordance with the probability\naxioms is the only clear-cut constraint on the credences of a rational\nagent. In impermissive forms of Bayesianism (often otherwise called\n\u201cobjective\u201d), further constraints are put forward that\nsignificantly restrict the range of rational credences, possibly up to\none single \u201cright\u201d probability function in any given\nsetting. Second, there are different attitudes towards so-called\nprinciple of total evidence (TE) for the credences on which a\nreasoner relies. TE Bayesians maintain that the relevant credences\nshould be represented by a probability function \\(P\\) which conveys\nthe totality of what is known to the agent. For non-TE approaches,\ndepending on the circumstances, \\(P\\) may (or should) be set up so\nthat portions of the evidence available are in fact bracketed.\n(Unsurprisingly, further subtleties arise as soon as one delves a bit\nfurther into the precise meaning and scope of TE; see Fitelson 2008\nand Williamson 2002, Chs. 9\u201310, for important discussions.)\n\nOf course, many intermediate positions exist between extreme forms of\npermissivism and impermissivism so outlined, and more or less the same\napplies for the TE issue. The above distinctions are surely rough\nenough, but useful nonetheless. Impermissive TE Bayesianism has served\nas a received view in early Bayesian philosophy of science (e.g.,\nCarnap 1950/1962). But impermissivism is easily found in combination\nwith non-TE positions, too (see, e.g., Maher 1996). TE permissivism\nseems a good approximation of De Finetti\u2019s (2008) stance, while\nnon-TE permissivism is arguably close to a standard view nowadays\n(see, e.g., Howson and Urbach 2006). No more than this will be needed\nto begin our exploration of Bayesian confirmation theories.\n",
