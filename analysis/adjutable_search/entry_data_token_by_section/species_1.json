    "main_text": "The Ontological Status of Species || The Death of Essentialism\n2.1 The Death of Essentialism\n\nSince Aristotle, species have been paradigmatic examples of natural\nkinds with essences. An essentialist approach to species makes sense\nin a pre Darwinian context. God created species and an eternal essence\nfor each species. After God\u2019s initial creation, each species is\na static, not an evolving group of organisms. Darwinism offers a\ndifferent view of species. Species are the result of speciation. No\nqualitative feature\u2014morphological, genetic, or\nbehavioral\u2014is considered essential for membership in a species.\nDespite this change in biological thinking, many philosophers still\nbelieve that species are natural kinds with essences. Let us start\nwith a brief introduction to kind essentialism and then turn to the\nbiological reasons why species fail to have essences.\n\nKind essentialism has a number of tenets. One tenet is that all and\nonly the members of a kind have a common essence. A second tenet is\nthat the essence of a kind is responsible for the traits typically\nassociated with the members of that kind. For example, gold\u2019s\natomic structure is responsible for gold\u2019s disposition to melt\nat certain temperatures. Third, knowing a kind\u2019s essence helps\nus explain and predict those properties typically associated with a\nkind. The application of any of these tenets to species is\nproblematic. But to see the failure of essentialism we need only\nconsider the first tenet.\n\nBiologists have had a hard time finding biological traits that occur\nin all and only the members of a species. Even such pre Darwinian\nessentialists as Linnaeus could not locate the essences of species\n(Ereshefsky 2001). Evolutionary theory explains why. A number of\nforces conspire against the universality and uniqueness of a trait in\na species (Hull 1965). Suppose a genetically based trait were found in\nall the members of a species. The forces of mutation, recombination,\nand random drift can cause the disappearance of that trait in a future\nmember of the species. All it takes is the disappearance of a trait in\none member of a species to show that it is not essential. The\nuniversality of a biological trait in a species is fragile.\n\nSuppose, nevertheless, that a trait occurs in all the members of a\nspecies. That trait is the essence of a species only if it is unique\nto that species. Yet organisms in different species often have common\ncharacteristics. Again, biological forces work against the uniqueness\nof a trait within a single species. Organisms in related species\ninherit similar genes and developmental programs from their common\nancestors. These common stores of developmental resources cause a\nnumber of similarities in the organisms of different species. Another\nsource of similar traits in different species is parallel evolution.\nSpecies frequently live in similar habitats with comparable selection\npressures. Those selection pressures cause the prominence of similar\ntraits in more than one species. The parallel evolution of opposable\nthumbs in primates and pandas is an example.\n\nThe existence of various evolutionary forces does not rule out the\npossibility of a trait occurring in all and only the members of a\nspecies. But consider the conditions such a trait must satisfy. A\nspecies\u2019 essential trait must occur in all the members of a\nspecies for the entire life of that species. Moreover, if that trait\nis to be unique to that species, it cannot occur in any other species\nfor the entire existence of life on this planet. The temporal\nparameters that species essentialism must satisfy are quite broad. The\noccurrence of a biological trait in all and only the members of a\nspecies is an empirical possibility. But given current biological\ntheory, that possibility is unlikely.\n\nOther arguments have been mustered against species essentialism. Hull\n(1965) contends that species have vague boundaries and that such\nvagueness is incompatible with the existence of species specific\nessences. According to Hull, essentialist definitions of natural kinds\nrequire strict boundaries between those kinds. But the boundaries\nbetween species are vague. In all but a few cases, speciation is a\nlong and gradual process such that there is no principled way to draw\na precise boundary between one species and the next. As a result,\nspecies cannot be given essentialist definitions. (Hull\u2019s\nargument against species essentialism is very similar to one of\nLocke\u2019s (1690[1975], III, vi) arguments against kind\nessentialism.)\n\nSober (1980) raises a different objection to species essentialism. He\nillustrates how essentialist explanations have been replaced by\nevolutionary ones. Essentialists explain variation within a species as\nthe result of interference in the ontogenetic development of\nparticular members of that species. Organisms have species specific\nessences, but interference often prevents the manifestations of those\nessences. Contemporary geneticists offer a different explanation of\nvariation within a species. They cite the gene frequencies of a\nspecies as well as the evolutionary forces that affect those\nfrequencies. No species specific essences are posited. Contemporary\nbiology can explain variation within a species without positing a\nspecies\u2019 essence. So according to Sober, species essentialism\nhas become theoretically superfluous.\n\nIn a pre Darwinian age, species essentialism made sense. Such\nessentialism, however, is out of step with contemporary evolutionary\ntheory. Evolutionary theory provides its own methods for explaining\nvariation within a species. It tells us that the boundaries between\nspecies are vague. And it tells us that a number of forces conspire\nagainst the existence of a trait in all and only the members of a\nspecies. From a biological perspective, species essentialism is no\nlonger a plausible position. Nevertheless, as we shall see in Section\n2.5, some philosophers have recently tried to revive species\nessentialism.\n",
