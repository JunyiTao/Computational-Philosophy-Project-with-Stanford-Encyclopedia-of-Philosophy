Building a Universal Machine\n\n\nWhen apprised in 1936 of Turing's idea for a universal machine,\nTuring's contemporary and friend, the economist David Champernowne,\nreacted by saying that such a thing was impractical; it would need\n\u2018the Albert Hall.\u2019 If built from relays as then employed in\ntelephone exchanges, that might indeed have been so, and Turing made no\nattempt at it. However, in 1937 Turing did work with relays on a\nsmaller machine with a special cryptological function (Hodges 1983, p.\n138). World history then led Turing to his unique role in the Enigma\nproblem, to his becoming the chief figure in the mechanisation of\nlogical procedures, and to his being introduced to ever faster and more\nambitious technology as the war continued. \n\n\nAfter 1942, Turing learnt that electronic components offered the\nspeed, storage capacity and logical functions required to be effective\nas \u2018tapes\u2019 and instruction tables. So from 1945, Turing\ntried to use electronics to turn his universal machine into practical\nreality. Turing rapidly composed a detailed plan for a modern\nstored-program computer: that is, a computer in which data and\ninstructions are stored and manipulated alike. Turing's ideas led the\nfield, although his report of 1946 postdated von Neumann's more famous\nEDVAC report (von Neumann 1945). It can however be argued, as does\nDavis (2000), that von Neumann gained his fundamental insight into the\ncomputer through his pre-war familiarity with Turing's logical work. At\nthe time, however, these basic principles were not much discussed. The\ndifficulty of engineering the electronic hardware dominated\neverything.\n\n\nIt therefore escaped observers that Turing was ahead of von Neumann\nand everyone else on the future of software, or as he called it, the\n\u2018construction of instruction tables.\u2019 Turing (1946) foresaw\nat once:\nInstruction tables will have to be made up by\nmathematicians with computing experiences and perhaps a certain\npuzzle-solving ability. There will probably be a great deal of work to\nbe done, for every known process has got to be translated into\ninstruction table form at some stage. \n\n\n\nThe process of constructing instruction tables should be very\nfascinating. There need be no real danger of it ever becoming a drudge,\nfor any processes that are quite mechanical may be turned over to the\nmachine itself.\n\n\n\nThese remarks, reflecting the universality of the computer, and its\nability to manipulate its own instructions, correctly described the\nfuture trajectory of the computer industry. However, Turing had in mind\nsomething greater: \u2018building a brain.\u2019 \n",
