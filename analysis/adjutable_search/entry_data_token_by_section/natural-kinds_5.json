Natural Kinds in the Special Sciences\n\nOur interest in natural kinds is generated by the fact that the\nparticular sciences make frequent use of what, on the face of it, seem\nto be natural kinds. So an important question is whether the kinds of\nthe special sciences (e.g. psychology, economics, biology, chemistry\nand so on) do in fact satisfy the conditions laid out by\nmetaphysicians for natural-kindhood (Fodor 1974; Dupr\u00e9 1981,\n1993; Millikan 1999; Ellis 2001). And to the extent that they do not,\ndoes that show that these kinds are not genuine natural kinds after\nall, but are something different? Or does it show that the\nmetaphysicians need to revise their theories of natural kindhood? The\nmetaphysical issues raised by the special sciences vary. For example,\nphilosophers of biology ask whether species would be better understood\nas being individuals rather than natural kinds. The so-called\nspecies problem (Ghiselin 1974, 1987, 1997; Hull 1976, 1978;\nKitts and Kitts 1979, LaPorte 1994) asks which are the appropriate\ncriteria to use in order to decide which particular species an\norganism belongs to. This is particularly challenging because species\nevolve over time, which makes it difficult to determine when we should\nrecognize a new species and distinguish it from a distinct, older\nancestor species or from distinct sister species. Furthermore, the\ncriteria advanced by most of the various species concepts on offer\ninvolve relational rather than intrinsic properties of organisms. So\neither species are not natural kinds or the view that kindhood is\nfixed by the intrinsic properties of things must be revised. In the\nphilosophy of chemistry, a key question is whether chemical kinds\nprovide as much support for microstructuralism as the stock examples\ndiscussed by metaphysicians suggest (Hendry 2006; LaPorte 2004;\nNeedham, 2000, 2002; Van Brakel, 2000). Microstructuralism is the view\nthat chemical kinds can be individuated solely in terms of their\nchemical microstructure. Chemical elements would appear to support\nmicrostructuralism since atomic number is sufficient to individuate\nany element. However, the extension of this view to more complex\nchemical structures (such as molecules) is much discussed in the\nliterature. In the philosophy of mind, the ontological status of\npsychological kinds has been questioned in the light of modern\nadvances in neuroscience (Churchland 1981; Fodor 1974). In particular,\naction is causally overdetermined by mental and neurophysiological\nkinds. If neuroscience can provide a sufficient account of action,\nthen the role of our common-sense folk psychological concepts, such as\nbelief and desire is called into question. Maybe\nthere are no psychological natural kinds corresponding to those\nconcepts. Natural kind realists reject the conventionalist view that\nin all cases the boundaries of \u2018natural\u2019 kinds are drawn\nby human interests. But is it plausible to draw a distinction between\ngenuinely natural and conventional kinds when it comes to the social\nsciences? In particular, is it important that, via a feedback effect,\nhuman perceptions of what kinds there are can have an effect on the\ncomposition and even existence of those kinds (Hacking 1995)?\n",
