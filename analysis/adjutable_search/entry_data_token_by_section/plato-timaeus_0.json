    "main_text": "Overview of the Dialogue\n1. Overview of the Dialogue\n\nThe opening conversation (17a1\u201327d4) introduces the\ncharacters\u2014Socrates, Timaeus, Critias and Hermocrates\u2014and\nsuggests that the latter three would contribute to a reply to\nSocrates\u2019 speech allegedly given on the previous day, which\npresented an ideal political arrangement strongly reminiscent of the\n Republic.[3]\n This reply would start with an account of the creation of the\nuniverse down to the creation of human beings and, in a second step,\nshow an ideal society in motion. Critias is meant to provide the\nsecond step with his account of a war between ancient Athens and\nAtlantis, the beginning of which we find in Plato\u2019s\nCritias, while Timaeus is meant to deal with the first step\nin our dialogue. Timaeus begins the discourse (27d5\u201392c9) with a\nprologue (27d5\u201329d6) in which he sets out the metaphysical\nprinciples on which his account is based, introduces the figure of the\nCraftsman and his eternal model, and provides a brief comment on the\nstatus of the account he is about to provide. This prologue is\nfollowed by the discourse proper, which is uninterrupted to the end of\nthe dialogue (29d7\u201392c9). The discourse unfolds in three main\nstages: the first sets out the achievements of Intellect\n(29d7\u201347e2), the second gives an account of the effects of\nNecessity (47d3\u201369a5), and the third shows how Intellect and\nNecessity cooperate in the production of the psychophysical\nconstitution of human beings (69a6\u201392c9).\n\nThe first of the main sections of the discourse explains the existence\nof the universe and some of its most general features teleologically.\nThe universe exists and manifests goodness because it is the handiwork\nof a supremely good, ungrudging Craftsman, who brought order to an\ninitially disorderly state of affairs. It is a living thing\n(z\u00f4[i]on, also translatable as \u201canimal\u201d),\nbecause it is better for it to possess intelligence than to lack it,\nand the acquisition of intelligence requires the acquisition of soul.\nIt is complete, and thus it includes within itself all the species of\nliving things as its parts. It is unique, because its model is unique;\nthe uniqueness of the model follows from its completeness. The\nworld\u2019s body is composed of fire (for visibility) and earth (for\ntangibility), but these so-called elements require the mediation of\nair and water in a progression of proportion to bind them together\ninto a unified, concordant whole. The shape of the universe\u2019s\nbody\u2014a sphere\u2014and the characteristics it possesses or\nlacks are all explained in terms of their various purposes. The\ncomposition of the world\u2019s soul out of a harmonically\nproportionate series of portions of a mixture of both divisible and\nindivisible Sameness, Difference and Being, and the division of these\nportions into two intersecting circles (called the circle of the Same\nand of the Different) explain the cognitive powers of the soul in\nrelation to the different types of objects of cognition: those that\nare and those that become. When joined with the world\u2019s body,\nthey also explain the cosmological organization of the universe. The\nheavenly bodies are divine and move in their various orbits to serve\nas markers of time: the fixed stars to mark a day/night, the moon to\nmark the (lunar) month and the sun to mark the year. Time itself came\ninto being together with these celestial movements as an \u201cimage\nof\n eternity.\u201d[4]\n Individual souls are made up of the residue (and an inferior grade)\nof the soul stuff of the universe, and are eventually embodied in\nphysical bodies. This embodiment throws the previously regular motions\nof the soul into confusion as the soul is subjected to the forceful\ndisturbances of internal bodily processes as well as the impact of\nexternal bodies upon it, particularly in sense experience. These\ndisturbances gravely impair the soul\u2019s cognitive functioning;\nonly with appropriate nurture and education can its original motions\nbe reestablished and proper cognitive functioning be restored. The\nbody and its parts were designed to support that functioning, and\nTimaeus takes the design of the eyes and the mechanics of vision as an\nimportant case in point.\n\nTimaeus prepares for the transition to the second main part of his\ndiscourse by pointing out that while a causal story of the sort he has\nbeen telling so far is indeed concerned with what is properly the\ncause (aitia) of the universe\u2019s generation, that story\nis not by itself sufficient and must extend to an account of\n\u201ccontributing causes\u201d (sunaitiai or\nsummetraitiai, 46c7, 46e6, 68e4\u20135) as well. The\ndiscourse must provide an account of the various physical structures\nthat are necessary for and support the achievement of the purposes of\nIntellect. The properties possessed by these various structures are\ndetermined by their constitutions as a matter of\n\u201cNecessity,\u201d and it is not open to the Craftsman to change\nor eliminate the properties of these structures. The properties allow\n(or disallow) certain processes desirable to the Craftsman, and to the\nextent that Intellect achieves its desiderata, it succeeds in\n\u201cpersuading\u201d Necessity (48a2\u20135). It is the role of\nthe second major part of the discourse to set forth these contributing\ncauses.\n\nThe second main section begins with the introduction of the\nreceptacle, a \u201cthird kind\u201d alongside the familiar\nparadigmatic forms and the generated images of the forms\n(49a1\u20134, 52a8, d2\u20134). The receptacle has been seen as\nserving either as material substratum or as some form of space or as\ncombining both roles. Timaeus\u2019 account of the receptacle\npresents several interpretive difficulties, some of which will be\ndiscussed below. In the \u201cpre-cosmic\u201d state (the state\n\u201cprior to\u201d the intervention of the Craftsman) the\nreceptacle is subject to erratic and disorderly motions, and moves its\ncontents in turn. Its contents are mere \u201ctraces\u201d\n(ichn\u00ea, 53b2) of the subsequently articulated four\n\u201ckinds\u201d (the so-called \u201celements\u201d): fire, air, water and earth. Each\nof these four kinds is made up of geometrical bodies\u2014fire of\ntetrahedra, air of octahedra, water of icosahedra, and earth of cubes.\nThe Craftsman begins by constructing these four regular solids as the\nprimary corpuscles of each of the four kinds. These solids have faces\nthat are made up (ultimately) of two types of right-angled\ntriangles\u2014the half-equilateral and the isosceles\u2014and it is\nthese triangles that are the \u201csimples\u201d of the physics of\nthe dialogue. Because their triangles are similar (half-equilateral),\nonly corpuscles of fire, air and water may be transformed into one\nanother; while corpuscles of earth are made up of isosceles triangles\nand are thus excluded from such transformations. Each of the four\nkinds has properties that are determined by the constitution of their\nrespective corpuscles, and these properties in turn determine how the\nparticles act upon and react to one another. These actions and\nreactions are ongoing and perpetuate a state of non-uniformity which\nitself is a necessary condition for motion, i.e., the continuation of\nthe interactions. Although each of the four kinds has a tendency to\nmove toward its own region of space, their being squeezed together in\na spherical universe without any gaps leads to the inevitable\ntransformations that occur when their various corpuscles cut or crush\none another. Thus it is assured that these migrations are never\ncompleted in the sense that there would be a complete separation of\nthe four elements into separate regions. The account proceeds to\nexplain the various varieties of each of the four kinds, and the\nsensible properties that they and their compounds manifest. An account\nof sensible properties calls for a preliminary account of sensation\n(including pleasure and pain), and it is with that preliminary account\nthat this section of the discourse concludes.\n\nThe third main section of the discourse\u2014about the cooperation of\nIntellect with Necessity\u2014focuses primarily on the psychophysical\nconstruction of the human being. While the Craftsman has created the\nindividual souls, he delegates the creation of the human bodies to the\nlesser, created gods. As individual immortal (and rational) souls are\nembodied in mortal bodies, the embodiment requires the further\ncreation of the \u201cmortal\u201d parts of the soul\u2014the\nspirited and appetitive parts, familiar from the Republic and\nthe Phaedrus. These parts are assigned their respective\nlocations in the body: the immortal and rational soul in the head, and\nthe two parts of the mortal soul in the trunk: the spirited part in\nthe chest (nearer to the head) and the appetitive part in the belly.\nThe various organs in the trunk\u2014the lungs and heart in the chest\nand the liver in the belly\u2014support the functions of their\nresident soul parts. The account proceeds to describe the formation of\nthe various bodily parts, setting out in each case the purpose of the\npart in question and showing how its construction (out of the\nappropriately selected materials) serves that purpose. The purpose is\nprescribed by Intellect, and the properties of the\nmaterials\u2014selected because their properties render them\ncompliant to Intellect\u2019s purposes\u2014are the consequences\n(and thus contributions) of Necessity. For the most part, Necessity\nserves the purposes of Intellect well, but this is not always the\ncase. A notable example of them coming apart is the covering around\nthe brain. That covering needs to be massive to provide maximal\nprotection, but that very massiveness would impede sensation, and so a\npreferential choice must be made between the conflicting demands. Such\noccasional cases of resistance by Necessity to the\n\u201cpersuasion\u201d of Intellect limit the degree of excellence\nthe created world can attain. Timaeus\u2019 discourse moves on with\nan account of the mechanisms of respiration and digestion, and a\nclassification and etiological discussion of various diseases of both\nbody and soul. This is preparatory to an exhortation to properly\nexercise both the soul and the body to recover or maintain physical\nand psychic well being. The well being of the soul in particular is\nemphasized: it is through realigning the motions of our souls with\nthose of the universe at large that we achieve our goal of living\nvirtuously and happily. The discourse concludes with an account of the\ngeneration of women and non-human animals.\n",
