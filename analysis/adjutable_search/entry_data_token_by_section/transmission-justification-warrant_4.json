    "main_text": "Failure of Epistemic Transmission || Non-Standard Accounts\n3.3 Non-Standard Accounts\n\nIn this section we outline two interesting branches in the literature\non transmission failure of justification and warrant across valid\ninference. We start with Smith\u2019s (2009) non-standard account of\nnon-transmissivity of justification. Then, we present\nAlspector-Kelly\u2019s (2015) account of non-transmissivity of\nPlantinga\u2019s warrant.\n\nAccording to Smith (2009), epistemic justification requires\nreliability. \\(s\\)\u2019s belief that \\(p\\), held on the\nbasis of \\(s\\)\u2019s belief that \\(e\\), is reliable in Smith\u2019s\nsense just in case in all possible worlds including \\(e\\) as true and\nthat are as normal (from the perspective of the actual world)\nas the truth of \\(e\\) permits, \\(p\\) is also true. Consider\n Zebra\n again.\n\nZebra\n\n\\(\\rE_3\\).\n The animals in the pen look like zebras.\n\\(\\rP_3\\).\n The animals in the pen are zebras.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_3\\).\n The animals in the pen are not mules cleverly disguised to look\nlike zebras.\n\n\n\n\\(s\\)\u2019s belief that\n \\(\\rP_3\\)\n is reliable in Smith\u2019s sense when it is based on \\(s\\)\u2019s\nbelief that\n \\(\\rE_3\\).\n (Disguising mules to make them look like zebras is certainly an\nabnormal practice.) Thus, all possible \\(\\rE_3\\)-worlds that\nare as normal as the truth of \\(\\rE_3\\) permits aren\u2019t worlds in\nwhich the animals in the pen are cleverly disguised mules. Rather,\nthey are \\(\\rP_3\\)-worlds\u2014i.e., worlds in which the animals in\nthe pen are zebras.\n\nSmith describes two ways in which a belief can possess this property\nof being reliable. One is that a belief that \\(p\\) has it in virtue of\nthe modal relationship with its basis \\(e\\). In this case, \\(e\\) is a\ncontributing reliable basis. Another possibility is when it is the\ncontent of the belief that \\(p\\), rather than the belief\u2019s modal\nrelationship with its basis \\(e\\), that guarantees by itself the\nbelief\u2019s reliability. In this case, \\(e\\) is a non-contributing\nreliable basis. An example of the first kind is \\(s\\)\u2019s belief\nthat\n \\(\\rP_3\\),\n which is reliable because of its modal relationship with\n \\(\\rE_3\\).\n There are obviously many sufficiently normal worlds in which\n\\(\\rP_3\\) is false, but no sufficiently normal world in which\n\\(\\rP_3\\) is false and \\(\\rE_3\\) true. An example of the second kind\nis \\(s\\)\u2019s belief that\n \\(\\rQ_3\\)\n as based on \\(\\rE_3\\). It is this belief\u2019s content, and not its\nmodal relationship with \\(\\rE_3\\), that guarantees its reliability. As\nSmith puts it, there are no sufficiently normal worlds in which\n\\(\\rE_3\\) is true and \\(\\rQ_3\\) is false, but this is simply because\nthere are no sufficiently normal worlds in which \\(\\rQ_3\\) is\nfalse.\n\nAccording to Smith, a deductive inference from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\) fails to\ntransmit to \\(q\\) justification relative to \\(p\\)\u2019s basis \\(e\\),\nif \\(e\\) is a contributing reliable basis for believing \\(p\\) but is a\nnon-contributing reliable basis for believing \\(q\\). In this case the\ninference fails to explain \\(q\\)\u2019s reliability: if\n\\(s\\) deduced one proposition from another, she would reliably believe\n\\(q\\), but not\u2014not even in part\u2014in virtue of having\ninferred \\(q\\) from \\(p\\) (as held on the basis of \\(e)\\).\nZebra fails to transmit to\n \\(\\rQ_3\\)\n justification relative to\n \\(\\rP_3\\)\u2019s\n basis\n \\(\\rE_3\\)\n in this\n sense.[9]\n\nLet\u2019s turn to Alspector-Kelly (2015). As we have seen,\nWright\u2019s analysis of failure of warrant transmission interprets\nthe epistemic good whose transmission is in question as, roughly, the\nsame as epistemic\n justification.[10]\n By so doing, Wright departs from Plantinga\u2019s (1993a, 1993b)\ninfluential understanding of warrant as the epistemic quality that\n(whatever it is) suffices to turn true belief into knowledge. One\nmight wonder, however, if there are deductive arguments incapable of\ntransmitting warrant in Plantinga\u2019s sense. (Hereafter we use\n\u2018warrant\u2019 only to refer to Plantinga\u2019s warrant.)\nAlspector-Kelly answers this question affirmatively contending that\ncertain arguments cannot transmit warrant because the cognitive\nproject of establishing their conclusion via inferring it from their\npremise is procedurally self-defeating.\n\nAlspector-Kelly follows Wright (2012) in characterizing a cognitive\nproject as a pair of a question and a procedure that one executes to\nanswer the question. An enabling condition of a cognitive\nproject is, for Alspector-Kelly, any proposition such that, unless it\nis true, one cannot learn the answer to its defining question by\nexecuting the procedure associated with it. That a given object \\(o\\)\nis illuminated, for example, is an enabling condition of the cognitive\nproject of determining its color by looking at it. For one cannot\nlearn by sight that \\(o\\) is of a given color unless \\(o\\) is\nilluminated.\n\nEnabling conditions can be opaque. An enabling condition of a\ncognitive project is opaque, relative to some actual or possible\nresult, if it is the case that whenever the execution of the\nassociated procedure yields this result, it would have produced the\nsame result had the condition been unfulfilled. The enabling condition\nthat \\(o\\) be illuminated of the cognitive project just considered is\nnot opaque, since looking at \\(o\\) never produces the same response\nabout \\(o\\)\u2019s color when \\(o\\) is illuminated and when it\nisn\u2019t. (In the second case, it produces no\nresponse.)\n\nNow consider the cognitive project of establishing by sight whether\n (\\(\\rP_3)\\)\n the animals enclosed in the pen are zebras. An enabling condition of\nthis project states that\n (\\(\\rQ_3)\\)\n the animals in the pen are not mules disguised to look like zebras.\nFor one couldn\u2019t learn whether \\(\\rP_3\\) is true by looking, if\n\\(\\rQ_3\\)were true. \\(\\rQ_3\\) is opaque with respect to the possible\noutcome that \\(\\rP_3\\). In fact, suppose \\(\\rQ_3\\) is satisfied\nbecause the pen contains (undisguised) zebras. In this case, looking\nat them will attest they are zebras, and the execution of the\nprocedure associated with this project will yield the outcome that\n\\(\\rP_3\\). But this is exactly the outcome that would be generated by\nthe execution of the same procedure if \\(\\rQ_3\\) were not\nsatisfied. In this case too, looking at the animals would produce the\nresponse that \\(\\rP_3\\).\n\nWe can now elucidate the notion of a procedurally\nself-defeating cognitive project. The distinguishing feature of\nany project of this type is that it seeks to answer the question\nwhether an opaque enabling condition\u2014call it\n\u2018\\(q\\)\u2019\u2014of the project itself is fulfilled. A\nproject of this type has the defect that it necessarily produces the\nresponse that \\(q\\) is fulfilled when \\(q\\) is unfulfilled. Given\nthis, it is intuitive that it cannot yield warrant to believe\n\\(q\\).\n\nAs an example of a procedurally self-defeating project, consider\ntrying to answer the question whether your informant is sincere by\nasking her this very question. Your informant\u2019s being\nsincere is an enabling condition of the very project you are carrying\nout. If your informant were not sincere, you couldn\u2019t learn\nanything from her. This condition is also opaque with respect to the\npossible response that she is sincere. For your informant would\nrespond that she is sincere both in case she is so and in case she\nisn\u2019t. Since the execution of this project is guaranteed to\nyield the result that your informant is sincere when she isn\u2019t,\nit is intuitive that it cannot yield warrant to believe that the\ninformant is sincere.\n\nAlspector-Kelly contends that arguments like Zebra\ndon\u2019t transmit warrant because the cognitive project of\ndetermining inferentially whether their conclusion is true is\nprocedurally self-defeating in the sense advertised. Let\u2019s apply\nthe explanation to Zebra.\n\nImagine you carry out Zebra. This initially commits you to\nexecuting the project of establishing whether\n \\(\\rP_3\\)\n by looking. Suppose you get\n \\(\\rE_3\\)\n and hence \\(\\rP_3\\) as an outcome. As we have seen,\n \\(\\rQ_3\\)\n is an opaque enabling condition relative to the outcome \\(\\rP_3\\) of\nthe cognitive project you have executed. Imagine that now, having\nreceived \\(\\rP_3\\) as a response to your first question, you embark in\nthe second project which carrying out Zebra commits you to:\nestablishing whether \\(\\rQ_3\\) is true by inference from \\(\\rP_3\\).\nThis project appears doomed.\n\n\\(\\rQ_3\\)\n is an enabling condition of the initial project of determining\nwhether\n \\(\\rP_3\\),\n which is opaque with respect to the very premise \\(\\rP_3\\).\nIt follows from this that \\(\\rQ_3\\) is also an enabling condition of\nthe second project. For if \\(\\rQ_3\\) were unfulfilled, you\ncouldn\u2019t learn \\(\\rP_3\\) and, a fortiori, you\ncouldn\u2019t learn anything else\u2014\\(\\rQ_3\\) included\u2014by\ninference from \\(\\rP_3\\). Another consequence is that \\(\\rQ_3\\) is an\nenabling condition of the second project that is opaque\nrelative to the very outcome that \\(\\rQ_3\\). Suppose first that\n\\(\\rQ_3\\) is true and that, having visually inspected the pen, you\nhave verified \\(\\rP_3\\). You then execute the inferential procedure\nassociated with the second project and produce the outcome that\n\\(\\rQ_3\\). Now consider the case in which \\(\\rQ_3\\) is false. Looking\ninto the pen still generates the outcome that \\(\\rP_3\\) is true. Thus,\nwhen you execute the procedure associated with the second project, you\nstill infer that \\(\\rQ_3\\) is true. Since you would get the result\nthat \\(\\rQ_3\\) is true even if \\(\\rQ_3\\) were false, the second\nproject is procedurally self-defeating. In conclusion, carrying out\nZebra commits you to executing a project that cannot generate\nwarrant for believing its conclusion \\(\\rQ_3\\). This explanation of\nnon-transmissivity generalizes to all structurally similar\narguments.\n",
