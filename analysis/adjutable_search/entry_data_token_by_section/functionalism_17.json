    "main_text": "Objections to Functionalism || Functionalism and Mental Causation\n5.2 Functionalism and Mental Causation\n\nAnother worry for functionalism is the \u201ccausal exclusion\nproblem\u201d, introduced in Section 3.4: the worry about whether\nrole functionalism can account for what we take to be the causal\nefficacy of our mental states (Malcolm 1968, Kim 1989, 1998). For\nexample, if pain is realized in me by some neural state-type, then\ninsofar as there are purely physical law-like generalizations linking\nstates of that type with pain behavior, one can give a complete causal\nexplanation of my behavior by citing the occurrence of that neural\nstate (and the properties by virtue of which it figures in those\nlaws). And thus, some have argued, the higher-level role properties of\nthat state \u2013 its being a pain \u2013 are causally\nirrelevant.\n\nThere have been a number of different responses to this problem. Some\n(e.g. Loewer 2002, 2007, Antony and Levine 1997, Burge 1997, Baker\n1997) suggest that it arises from an overly restrictive account of\ncausation, in which a cause must \u201cgenerate\u201d or\n\u201cproduce\u201d its effect, a view which would count the\nmacroscopic properties of other special sciences as causally\nirrelevant as well. Instead, some argue, causation should be regarded\nas a special sort of counterfactual dependence between states of\ncertain types (Loewer 2002, 2007, Fodor 1990, Block 1997), or as a\nspecial sort of regularity that holds between them (Melnyk 2003). If\nthis is correct, then functional role properties (along with the other\nmacroscopic properties of the special sciences) could count as\ncausally efficacious (but see Ney 2012 for dissent). However, the\nplausibility of these accounts of causation depends on their prospects\nfor distinguishing bona-fide causal relations from those that are\nclearly epiphenomenal, and some have expressed skepticism about\nwhether they can do the job, among them Crane 1995, Kim 2007, Jackson\n1995, Ludwig 1998, and McLaughlin 2006, 2015. (On the other hand, see\nLyons (2006) for an argument that if functional properties are\ncausally inefficacious, this can be viewed as a benefit of\nthe theory.)\n\nYet other philosophers argue that causation is best regarded as a\nrelation between types of events that must be invoked to provide\nsufficiently general explanations of behavior (Antony and Levine 1997,\nBurge 1997, Baker 1997). Though many who are moved by the exclusion\nproblem (e.g. Kim, Jackson) maintain that there is a difference\nbetween generalizations that are truly causal and those that\ncontribute in some other (merely epistemic) way to our understanding\nof the world, theorists who advocate this response to the problem\ncharge that this objection, once again, depends on a restrictive view\nof causation that would rule out too much.\n\nAnother problem with views like the ones sketched above, some argue\n(Kim 1989, 1998), is that mental and physical causes would thereby\noverdetermine their effects, since each would be causally\nsufficient for their production. And, though some theorists argue that\noverdetermination is widespread and unproblematic (see Loewer 2002,\nand also Shaffer, 2003, and Sider 2003, for a more general discussion\nof overdetermination), others contend that there is a special relation\nbetween role and realizer that provides an intuitive explanation of\nhow both can be causally efficacious without counting as\noverdetermining causes. For example, Yablo (1992), suggests that\nmental and physical properties stand in the relation of determinable\nand determinate (just as red stands to scarlet), and argues that our\nconviction that a cause should be commensurate with its\neffects permits us to take the determinable, rather than the\ndeterminate, property to count as causally efficacious in\npsychological explanation. Bennett (2003) suggests, alternatively,\nthat the realizer properties metaphysically necessitate the\nrole properties in a way that prevents them from satisfying the\nconditions for overdetermination. Yet another suggestion (Wilson,\n1999, 2011, and Shoemaker, 2001) is that the causal powers of mental\nproperties are included among (or are proper subsets of) the causal\npowers of the physical properties that realize them. (See also\nMacdonald and Macdonald 1995, Witmer, 2003, Yates, 2012, and Strevens,\n2012, for related views.)\n\nThere has been substantial recent work on the causal exclusion\nproblem, which, as noted earlier, arises for any non-reductive theory\nof mental states. (See the entry on\n mental causation,\n as well as Bennett 2007, and Funkhouser 2007, for further discussion\nand extensive bibliographies.) But it is worth discussing a related\nworry about causation that arises exclusively for role-functionalism\n(and other dispositional theories), namely, the problem of\n\u201cmetaphysically necessitated effects\u201d (Rupert 2006,\nBennett 2007). If pain is functionally defined (either by an\nanalytic or an empirical theory) as the state of being in\nsome lower-level state or other that, in certain circumstances causes\nwincing, then it seems that the generalization that pain causes\nwincing (in those circumstances) is at best uninformative, since the\nstate in question would not be pain if it didn\u2019t. And,\non the Humean view of causation as a contingent relation, the causal\nclaim would be false. Davidson (1980b) once responded to a similar\nargument by noting that even if a mental state M is defined\nin terms of its production of an action A, it can often be\nredescribed in other terms P such that \u2018P\ncaused A\u2019 is not a logical truth. But it\u2019s\nunclear whether any such redescriptions are available to role (vs.\nrealizer) functionalists.\n\nSome theorists (e.g. Antony and Levine 1997) have responded by\nsuggesting that, though mental states may be defined in terms of some\nof their effects, they have other effects that do not follow\nfrom those definitions which can figure into causal generalizations\nthat are contingent, informative, and true. For example, even if it\nfollows from a functional definition that pain causes wincing (and\nthus that the relation between pain and wincing cannot be truly\ncausal), psychologists may discover, say, that pain produces\nresilience (or submissive behavior) in human beings. One might worry,\nnonetheless, that functional definitions threaten to leave too many\ncommonly cited generalizations outside the realm of contingency, and\nthus causal explanation: surely, we may think, we want to affirm\nclaims such as \u201cpain causes wincing\u201d. Such claims could be\naffirmed, however, if (as seems likely) the most plausible functional\ntheories define sensations such as pain in terms of a small subset of\ntheir distinctive psychological, rather than behavioral,\neffects (see section 4.2).\n\nA different line of response to this worry (Shoemaker 1984d, 2001) is\nto deny the Humean account of causation altogether, and contend that\ncausal relations are themselves metaphysically necessary, but this\nremains a minority view. (See also Bird, 2002, and Latham, 2011, for\nfurther discussion.)\n",
