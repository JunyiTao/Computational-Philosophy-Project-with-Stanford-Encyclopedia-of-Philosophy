    "main_text": "Confirmation by instances || Two paradoxes and other difficulties\n1.2 Two paradoxes and other difficulties\n\nThe ravens paradox (Hempel 1937, 1945). Consider the\nfollowing statements:\n\n(\\(h\\)) \\(\\forall\nx(raven(x) \\rightarrow black(x))\\), i.e., all ravens are\nblack;\n(\\(e\\)) \\(raven(a)\n\\wedge black(a)\\), i.e., \\(a\\) is a black raven; \n(\\(e^*\\)) \\(\\neg\nblack(a^*) \\wedge \\neg raven(a^*)\\), i.e., \\(a^*\\) is a non-black\nnon-raven (say, a green apple).\n\n\nIs hypothesis \\(h\\) confirmed by \\(e\\) and \\(e^*\\) alike? That is, is\nthe claim that all ravens are black equally confirmed by the\nobservation of a black raven and by the observation of a non-black\nnon-raven (e.g., a green apple)? One would want to say no, but\nHempel\u2019s theory is unable to draw this distinction. Let\u2019s\nsee why.\n\nAs we know, \\(e\\) (directly) Hempel-confirms \\(h\\), according to\nHempel\u2019s reconstruction of Nicod. By the same token, \\(e^*\\)\n(directly) Hempel-confirms the hypothesis that all non-black objects\nare non-ravens, i.e., \\(h^* = \\forall x(\\neg black(x) \\rightarrow \\neg\nraven(x))\\). But \\(h^* \\vDash h\\) (\\(h\\) and \\(h^*\\) are just\nlogically equivalent). So, \\(e^*\\) (the observation report of a\nnon-black non-raven), like \\(e\\) (black raven), does (indirectly)\nHempel-confirm \\(h\\) (all ravens are black). Indeed, as \\(\\neg\nraven(a)\\) entails \\(raven(a) \\rightarrow black(a)\\), it can be shown\nthat \\(h\\) is (directly) Hempel-confirmed by the observation of\nany object that is not a raven (an apple, a cat, a shoe),\napparently disclosing puzzling \u201cprospects for indoor\nornithology\u201d (Goodman 1955, 71).\n\n\\(Blite\\) (Goodman 1955). Consider the peculiar predicate\n\u201c\\(blite\\)\u201d, defined as follows: an object is blite just\nin case (i) it is black if examined at some moment \\(t\\) up to some\nfuture time \\(T\\) (say, the next expected appearance of Halley\u2019s\ncomet, in 2061) and (ii) it is white if examined afterwards. So we\nposit \\(blite(x) \\equiv (ex_{t\\le T}(x) \\rightarrow black(x)) \\wedge\n(\\neg ex_{t\\le T}(x) \\rightarrow white(x))\\). Now consider the\nfollowing statements:\n\n(\\(h\\)) \\(\\forall\nx(raven(x) \\rightarrow black(x))\\), i.e., all ravens are\nblack;\n(\\(h^*\\)) \\(\\forall\nx(raven(x) \\rightarrow blite(x))\\), i.e., all ravens are\nblite;\n(\\(e\\)) \\(e = raven(a)\n\\wedge ex_{t\\le T}(a) \\wedge black(a)\\), i.e., \\(a\\) is a raven\nobserved no later than \\(T\\) and it is black.\n\n\nDoes \\(e\\) confirm hypotheses \\(h\\) and \\(h^*\\) alike? That is, does\nthe observation of a black raven before \\(T\\) confirms equally the\nclaim that all ravens are black as the claim that all ravens are\nblite? Here again, one would want to say no, but Hempel\u2019s theory\nis unable to draw the distinction. For one can check that the\n\\(e\\)-developments of \\(h\\) and \\(h^*\\) are both entailed by \\(e\\).\nThus, \\(e\\) (the report of a raven examined no later than \\(T\\) and\nfound to be black) does Hempel-confirm \\(h^*\\) (all ravens are blite)\njust as it confirms \\(h\\) (all ravens are black). Moreover, \\(e\\) also\nHempel-confirms the statement that a raven will be white if examined\nafter \\(T\\), because this is a logical consequence of \\(h^*\\) (which\nis directly Hempel-confirmed by \\(e\\)). And finally, suppose that\n\\(blurple(x) \\equiv (ex_{t\\le T}(x) \\rightarrow black(x)) \\wedge (\\neg\nex_{t\\le T}(x) \\rightarrow purple(x)).\\) We then have that the very\nsame evidence statement \\(e\\) Hempel-confirms the hypothesis that all\nravens are blurple, and thus also its implication that a raven will be\n\\(purple\\) if examined after \\(T\\)!\n\nA seemingly obvious idea, here, is that there must be something\ninherently wrong with predicates such as \\(blite\\) or \\(blurple\\) (and\nperhaps non-raven and non-black, too) and thus a\nprincipled way to rule them out as \u201cunnatural\u201d. Then one\ncould restrict confirmation theory accordingly, i.e., to\n\u201cnatural kinds\u201d only (see, e.g., Quine 1970). Yet this\npoint turns out be very difficult to pursue coherently and it has not\nborne much fruit in this discussion (Rinard 2014 is a recent\nexception). After all, for all we know, it is a perfectly\n\u201cnatural\u201d feature of a token of the \u201cnatural\nkind\u201d water that it is found in one physical state for\ntemperatures below 0 degrees Celsius and in an entirely different\nstate for temperatures above that threshold. So why should the time\nthreshold \\(T\\) in \\(blite\\) or \\(blurple\\) be a reason to dismiss\nthose predicates? (The water example comes from Howson 2000,\n31\u201332. See Schwartz 2011, 399 ff., for a more general assessment\nof this issue.)\n\nThe above, widely known \u201cparadoxes\u201d then suggest that\nHempel\u2019s analysis of confirmation is too liberal: it\nsanctions the existence of confirmation relations that are intuitively\nvery unsound (see Earman and Salmon 1992, 54, and Sprenger 2011a, 243,\nfor more on this). Yet the Hempelian notion of confirmation turns out\nto be very restrictive, too, on other accounts. For suppose that\nhypothesis \\(h\\) and evidence \\(e\\) do not share any piece of\nnon-logical vocabulary. \\(h\\) might be, say, Newton\u2019s law of\nuniversal gravitation (connecting force, distances and masses), while\n\\(e\\) could be the description of certain spots on a telescopic image.\nThroughout modern physics, significant relations of confirmation and\ndisconfirmation were taken to obtain between statements like these.\nIndeed, telescopic sightings have been crucial evidence for\nNewton\u2019s law as applied to celestial bodies. However, as their\nnon-logical vocabularies are disjoint, \\(e\\) and \\(h\\) must simply be\nlogically independent, and so must be \\(e\\) and \\(dev_{e}(h)\\) (with\nvery minor caveats, this follows from Craig\u2019s so-called\ninterpolation theorem, see Craig 1957). In such circumstances, there\ncan be nothing but Hempel-neutrality between evidence and hypothesis.\nSo Hempel\u2019s original theory seems to lack the resources to\ncapture a key feature of inductive inference in science as well as in\nseveral other domains, i.e., the kind of \u201cvertical\u201d\nrelationships of confirmation (and disconfirmation) between the\ndescription of observed phenomena and hypotheses concerning underlying\nstructures, causes, and processes.\n\nTo overcome the latter difficulty, Clark Glymour (1980a) embedded a\nrefined version of Hempelian confirmation by instances in his analysis\nof scientific reasoning. In Glymour\u2019s revision, hypothesis \\(h\\)\nis confirmed by some evidence \\(e\\) even if appropriate auxiliary\nhypotheses and assumptions must be involved for \\(e\\) to entail the\nrelevant instances of \\(h\\). This important theoretical move turns\nconfirmation into a three-place relation concerning the\nevidence, the target hypothesis, and (a conjunction of) auxiliaries.\nOriginally, Glymour presented his sophisticated neo-Hempelian approach\nin stark contrast with the competing traditional view of so-called\nhypothetico-deductivism (HD). Despite his explicit\nintentions, however, several commentators have pointed out that,\npartly because of the due recognition of the role of auxiliary\nassumptions, Glymour\u2019s proposal and HD end up being plagued by\nsimilar difficulties (see, e.g., Horwich 1983, Woodward 1983, and\nWorrall 1982). In the next section, we will discuss the HD framework\nfor confirmation and also compare it with Hempelian confirmation. It\nwill thus be convenient to have a suitable extended definition of the\nlatter, following the remarks above. Here is one that serves our\npurposes:\n\nHempelian confirmation (extended)\n\nFor any \\(h, e,k \\in \\bL\\) such that \\(e\\) contains individual\nconstants only (no quantifier), \\(k = dev_{e}(\\alpha)\\) for some\n\\(\\alpha \\in \\bL\\) containing quantifiers only (no individual\nconstant) and such that \\(\\alpha \\not\\vDash h\\), and \\(e\\wedge k\\) is\nconsistent:\n\n\n \\(e\\) directly Hempel-confirms \\(h\\) relative\nto \\(k\\) if and only if \\(e\\wedge k \\vDash dev_{e}(h)\\); \\(e\\)\nHempel-confirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\) if and only\nif, for some \\(s \\in \\bL, e\\wedge k \\vDash dev_{e}(s)\\) and \\(s\\wedge\nk \\vDash h\\);\n\\(e\\) directly Hempel-disconfirms \\(h\\) relative\nto \\(k\\) if and only if \\(e\\wedge k \\vDash dev_{e}(\\neg h)\\);\n\\(e\\) Hempel-disconfirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\) if\nand only if, for some \\(s\\in \\bL, e\\wedge k \\vDash dev_{e}(s)\\)a and\n\\(s\\wedge k \\vDash \\neg h\\);\n \\(e\\) is Hempel-neutral for \\(h\\) relative to\n\\(k\\) otherwise.\n\n\n\nOne can see that in the above definition the auxiliary assumptions in\n\\(k\\) are the \\(e\\)-development of further closed constant-free\nhypotheses (in fact, equations as applied to specific measured values,\nin typical examples from Glymour 1980a), where such hypotheses are\nmeant to be conjoined in a single statement (\\(\\alpha\\)) for\nconvenience. This implies that the only terms occurring\n(non-vacuously) in \\(k\\) are individual constants already occurring\n(non-vacuously) in \\(e\\). For an empty \\(\\alpha\\) (that is,\ntautologous: \\(\\alpha = \\top\\)), \\(k\\) must be empty too, and the\noriginal (restricted) definition of Hempelian confirmation applies. As\nfor the proviso that \\(\\alpha \\not\\vDash h\\), it rules out undesired\ncases of circularity\u2014akin to so-called \u201cmacho\u201d\nbootstrap confirmation, as discussed in Earman and Glymour 1988 (for\nmore on Glymour\u2019s theory and its developments, see Douven and\nMeijs 2006, and references therein).\n",
