    "main_text": "Social Construction || The Construction of Gender\n2.4 The Construction of Gender\n\nWhile the question of what gender is has always been a central\nquestion for feminism and feminist theory, it has received increased\nattention in recent years. We will discuss why an account of gender is\nimportant for feminist theory and point out how any theorizing is\nalways situated in a political landscape that is both spatially and\ntemporally bounded. The examples we will use are two recent book\nlength treatments of gender, by Sally Haslanger and Charlotte Witt;\nboth offer accounts of the metaphysics of gender, i.e., of the nature\nof gender categories. We will also mention in passing some other\nrecent accounts, but for a fuller discussion of gender see Mikkola\n2016a. \n\nThe aim of feminism is, in the most general terms, to end the\noppression of women. The goal of feminist theory is, therefore, to\ntheorize how women are oppressed and how we can work towards ending\nit. But what is this group women? Whose oppression is the\nmovement aiming to end? For articulating the various ways in which\nwomen are oppressed, there is a need for a working definition of what\nit is to be a woman (for a contrary view see Mikkola 2016b). But the\nvarious accounts of the different dimensions (social, economical,\npsychological, etc.) of the oppression of women may in fact call for\ndifferent accounts of gender. It is, therefore, not always clear that\nseemingly incompatible accounts of gender are in fact incompatible.\nThey may in fact often be answering different questions. \n\nLet\u2019s go back to Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s words, \u201cOne is\nnot born a woman, but rather becomes one\u201d. On this picture, one\nis born biologically female or male and slowly becomes socialized into\na woman or man. What is the relationship between sex and gender here?\nThe slogan used by feminists since the seventies, as mentioned before,\nis gender is the social meaning of sex and gender is thought\nto be a social construction.\n\nSally Haslanger embraces the slogan gender is the social meaning\nof sex and the conception of gender that she offers is to do\njustice to that slogans (Haslanger 2012). While she discusses many\nways something can be socially constructed, a central conception of\nsocial construction she is aiming to articulate is one that makes\nsense of that slogan. Here is her account of gender (Haslanger 2012:\n234):\n\n\nS is a woman if and only if\n\nS is regularly and for the most part observed or imagined\nto have certain bodily features presumed to be evidence of a\nfemale\u2019s biological role in reproduction; \nthat S has these features marks S within the\ndominant ideology of S\u2019s society as someone who ought to\noccupy certain kinds of social position that are in fact subordinate\n(and so motivates and justifies S occupying such a position);\nand \nthe fact that S satisfies (i) and (ii) plays a role in\nS\u2019s systematic subordination, that is, along some\ndimension, S\u2019s social position is oppressive, and\nS\u2019s satisfying (i) and (ii) plays a role in that\ndimension of subordination.\n\n\nS is a man if and only if\n\nS is regularly and for the most part observed or imagined\nto have certain bodily features presumed to be evidence of a\nmale\u2019s biological role in reproduction; \nthat S has these features marks S within the\ndominant ideology of S\u2019s society as someone who ought to\noccupy certain kinds of social position that are in fact privileged\n(and so motivates and justifies S\u2019s occupying such a\nposition); and \nthe fact that S satisfies (i) and (ii) plays a role in\nS\u2019s systematic privilege, that is, along some dimension,\nS\u2019s social position is privileged, and S\u2019s\nsatisfying (i) and (ii) plays a role in that dimension of privilege.\n\n\n\n\nGenders are socially constructed constitutively. To be of a gender is\nto have a place in a hierarchical structure and genders are\nconstituted by the hierarchical power relations. So here we have an\naccount of constitutive construction: genders are social statuses\nconstituted by hierarchical power relations. How does this do justice\nto the aforementioned slogan? To be of a certain gender is to be taken\nto have bodily features presumed to be evidence of a role in\nbiological reproduction and occupy a hierarchical social position\nbecause of that.\n\nHaslanger\u2019s account of the social construction of gender is an\nanswer to the question what type of thing genders are, how they are\ncreated and maintained. According to her account, genders are social\nstatuses within a hierarchical social structure and not, for example,\nbiological categories. On her view, when offering a theory of\nsomething, be it gender or something else, we always have to ask what\nwe want the theory for: what questions is the theory supposed to\nanswer, what bring to light? And a theory is always a child of its\nmaker, and their time and place, and is offered in the context of the\nconversations and political and activist struggles that are taking\nplace then. For instance, Haslanger first articulated her theory of\ngender in 1995\u20131996, and wanted to give an account that\ndidn\u2019t define women in terms of some intrinsic (biological or\npsychological) trait, but rather, in the materialist feminist\ntradition, considered women to be a social class. The aim was to\nhighlight certain structural injustices we are all party to, but not\nto give an account of gender to settle all questions regarding gender.\nA structural account differs in aims from one that has as its central\ntarget to capture people\u2019s own conceptions of their experience.\nFor critical engagements with Haslanger\u2019s theory, it is helpful\nto begin with Mills 2014, Jones 2014, Haslanger 2014, Mikkola 2016a,\nand Bettcher 2012.\n\nCharlotte Witt offers an account of gender in her recent book, The\nMetaphysics of Gender (2011c) that draws on Aristotle as well as\nfeminist theory. The chief aim of Witt\u2019s account is to give a\nmetaphysics of gender that can elucidate the centrality of gender in\nour lived experience and she develops a framework to make sense of\nthat centrality. Her claim is that as a matter of fact, in western\nlate-capitalist societies like the United States, gender is\nuniessential to social individuals. Let us flesh this out\n(here we draw on \u00c1sta Sveinsd\u00f3ttir 2012). \n\nFirst, for a function to be uniessential to an entity is for it to\nunify and organize all the parts of that individual into the whole\nthat is the individual. For example, the time-telling function unifies\nand organizes all the tiny metal parts (hands, spring, gears, etc)\ninto the whole which is the watch itself. Similarly, the sheltering\nfunction unifies and organizes all the planks of a wooden house into\nthe entity that is the house itself.\n\nGender, understood in this way, is a function that organizes all the\nparts of a social individual into the social individual it is. The\nparts in question are all the other social roles the social individual\noccupies: parent, friend, professor, child, colleague, etc. Gender\n(man, woman) is a mega social role that unifies all the other\nsocial roles into the agent that is the social individual. Being a\nwoman, a parent, etc, is to occupy a social position, with which come\nnorms of behavior. The social individual is the entity that occupies\nall these social positions, the bearer of these social properties, if\nyou will.\n\nThe social individual is distinct from the human organism and\nthe person because the social individual stands in social\nrelations essentially, but human organisms and persons do so only\naccidentally. Similarly, the person is distinct from the human\norganism and the social individual because the person has the capacity\nto take a first person perspective on itself essentially, but the\nhuman organism and the social individual only have that accidentally.\nFinally, the human organism has certain biological features\nessentially, but the person and the social individual does so only\naccidentally. For critical engagements with Witt\u2019s theory, it is\nhelpful to begin with Cudd 2012, Mikkola 2012, and \u00c1sta\nSveinsd\u00f3ttir 2012.\n\nThere are a number of other recent accounts of gender. We mention some\nhere briefly. For a fuller discussion, see Mikkola 2016a.\n\nNatalie Stoljar (1995) argues that the concept of gender is a cluster\nconcept. There are no features that all and only women share; rather\nthe concept of woman stands for a cluster of features and one can be a\nwoman in virtue of having one or more of these features. Linda Alcoff\n(2006) argues that gender is a position in a network of social and\ncultural institutions and ideologies. The gender position one occupies\nis defined by the possibilities one has with regard to biological\nreproduction. \u00c1sta Sveinsd\u00f3ttir (2011, 2013) offers a\nradically contextual account of gender, on which gender is a\nconferred social status. In different contexts different\nfeatures serve as base features for the conferral of gender (role in\nbiological reproduction, sexual role, self-identification, etc.).\nTheodore Bach (2012)\nargues that genders are natural kinds with a historical essence. To be\na woman, on his view, is to be produced in the right way, have the\nright lineage. A woman has the right lineage if she is the product of\n\u201contogenetic processes through which a historical gender system\nreplicates women\u201d (Bach 2012: 271). Jennifer McKitrick (2015)\nargues that gender is a dispositional property. One is of a certain\ngender just in case one is disposed to behave in certain ways in\ncertain situations. Following Haslanger 2012, Katharine Jenkins (2016)\ngives an ameliorative account of gender, but one in which there are\ntwo target concepts: gender as class and gender as identity.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind when approaching the literature on\ngender that different theorists have different aims in mind when\noffering a theory of gender, and different phenomena that the accounts\nare to capture. Some want to capture something about lived experience,\nothers highlight certain dimensions of injustice. For instance, while\ngender is a social position for both Witt and Haslanger, in our brief\ndiscussion we see that they are focused on different things in\ndeveloping their accounts. Witt is focused on the centrality of gender\nand gender norms in our lived experience; Haslanger on structural\ngender oppression. Also, some theorists approach gender by giving an\naccount of the (or a) concept of gender, others how certain words get\nused. Still others offer a real definition, a definition of the\nphenomenon itself, as opposed to a concept of it, or words used to\nrefer to it. Yet others focus on gender identity. How all these\nprojects are related and whether they do conflict may not be evident\nat first glance.\n",
