    "main_text": "Mechanical properties || Discontinuous quantities: The Littlewood-Ross Paradox\n1.3 Discontinuous quantities: The Littlewood-Ross Paradox\n\nSometimes supertasks require a physical quantity to be discontinuous\nin time. One example of this, known as Ross\u2019 paradox, was described by\nJohn Littlewood (1953) as an \u201cinfinity paradox\u201d and\nexpanded upon by Sheldon Ross (1988) in his well-known textbook on\nprobability. It goes as follows.\n\nSuppose we have a jar\u2014a very large jar\u2014with the\ncapacity to hold infinitely many balls. We also have a countably\ninfinite pile of balls, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, \u2026. First we drop balls\n1\u201310 into the jar, then remove ball 1. (This adds a total of nine\nballs to the jar.) Then we drop balls 11\u201320 in the jar, and remove\nball 2. (This brings the total up to eighteen.) Suppose that we\ncontinue in this way ad infinitum, and that we do so with\never-increasing speed, so that we will have used up our entire\ninfinite pile of balls in finite time (Figure 1.3.1). How many balls\nwill be in the jar when this supertask is over?\n\n\nFig 1.3.1.\nThe Littlewood-Ross procedure.\n\n\nBoth Littlewood (1953) and Ross (1976) responded that the answer is\nzero. Their reasoning went as follows.\n\nBall 1 was removed at the first stage. Ball 2 was removed at the\nsecond stage. Ball n was removed at the nth stage, and so on ad\ninfinitum. Since each ball has a label n, and since each label n was\nremoved at the nth stage of the supertask, there can be only be zero\nballs left in the jar at the end after every stage has been completed.\nOne can even identify the moment at which each of them was\nremoved.\n\nSome may be tempted to object that, on the contrary, the number of\nballs in the jar should be infinite when the supertask is complete.\nAfter the first stage there are 9 balls in the jar. After the second\nstage there are 18. After the third stage there are 27. In the limit\nas the number of stages approaches infinity, the total number of balls\nin the jar diverges to infinity. If the final state of the jar is\ndetermined by what the finite-stage states are converging to, then the\nsupertask should conclude with infinitely many balls in the jar.\n\nIf both of these responses are equally reasonable, then we have a\ncontradiction. There cannot be both zero and infinity balls in a jar.\nIt is in this sense that the Littlewood-Ross example might be a\nparadox.\n\nAllis and Koetsier (1991) argued that only the first response is\njustified because of a reasonable \u201cprinciple of\ncontinuity\u201d: that the positions of the balls in space are a\ncontinuous function of time. Without such a principle, the positions\nof the balls outside the jar could be allowed to teleport\ndiscontinuously back into the jar as soon as the supertask is\ncomplete. But with such a principle in place, one can conclude that\nthe jar must be empty at the end of the supertask. This principle has\nbeen challenged by Van Bendegum (1994), with a clarifying rejoinder by\nAllis and Koetsier (1996).\n\nEarman and Norton (1996) follow Allis and Koetsier (and Littlewood and\nRoss) in demanding that the worldlines of the balls in the jar be\ncontinuous, but point out that there is a different sense of\ndiscontinuity that develops as a consequence. (A\n\u2018worldline\u2019 is used here to describe the trajectory of a\nparticle through space and time; it is discussed more below in the\nsection on Time in Relativistic Spacetime.)\nNamely, if one views the number of balls in the jar as approximated by\na function \\(N(t)\\) of time, then this \u201cnumber\nfunction\u201d is discontinuous in the Littlewood-Ross supertask,\nblowing up to an arbitrarily large value over the course of the\nsupertask before dropping discontinuously to 0 once it is over. In\nthis sense, the Littlewood-Ross paradox presents us with a choice, to\neither,\n\nTake the worldline of each ball in the jar to be continuous in\ntime; or\nTake the number \\(N(t)\\) of balls in the jar to be approximated by a\ncontinuous function of time;\n\n\nbut not both. The example thus seems to require a physical quantity to\nbe discontinuous in time: either in the worldlines of the balls, or in\nthe number of balls in the jar.\n\nA variation of the Littlewood-Ross example has been posed as a puzzle\nfor decision theory by Barrett and Arntzenius (1999, 2002). They\npropose a game involving an infinite number of $1 bills, each numbered\nby a serial number 1, 2, 3, \u2026, and in which a person begins with $0.\nThe person must then choose between the following two options.\n\nOption A: accept $1; or\nOption B: first accept $2n+1, where n is the\nnumber of times the offer has been made, and then return whatever bill\nthe player holds with the smallest serial number.\n\n\nAt each finite stage of the game it appears to be rational to choose\nOption B. For example, at stage n=1 Option B returns $3, while\nOption A returns $1. At stage n=2 Option B returns $7 while\nOption A returns $1. And so on.\n\nHowever, suppose that one plays this game as a supertask, so that the\nentire infinite number of offers is played in finite time. Then how\nmuch money will the player have? Following exactly the same reasoning\nas in the Littlewood-Ross paradox, we find that the answer is $0. For\neach bill\u2019s serial number, there is a stage at which that bill was\nreturned. So, if we presume the worldlines of the bills must be\ncontinuous, then the infinite game ends with the player winning\nnothing at all. This is a game in which the rational strategy at each\nfinite stage does not provide a winning strategy for the infinite\ngame.\n\nThere are variations on this example that have a more positive yield\nfor the players. For example, Earman and Norton (1996) propose the\nfollowing pyramid marketing scheme. Suppose that an agent sells two\nshares of a business for $1,000 each to a pair of agents. Each agent\nsplits their share in two and sells it for $2,000 to two more agents,\nthus netting $1,000 while four new agents go into debt for $1,000\neach. Each of the four new agents then do the same, and so on ad\ninfinitum. How does this game end?\n\nIf the pool of agents is only finitely large, then the last agents\nwill get saddled with the debt while all the previous agents make a\nprofit. But if the pool is infinitely large, and the pyramid marketing\nscheme becomes a supertask, then all of the agents will have profited\nwhen it is completed. At each stage in which a given agent is in debt,\nthere is a later stage in which the agent sells to shares and makes\n$1,000. This is thus a game that starts with equal total amount of\nprofit and debt, but concludes having converted the debt into pure\nprofit.\n",
