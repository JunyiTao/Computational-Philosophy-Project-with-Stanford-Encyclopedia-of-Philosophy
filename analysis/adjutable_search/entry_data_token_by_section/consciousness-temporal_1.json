    "main_text": "Three Models of Temporal Consciousness || Terminology, Problems and Principles\n1.2 Terminology, Problems and Principles\n\nAlthough proponents of the competing approaches are attempting to make\nsense of our experience of temporally extended phenomena, there are\ndivergences on the issue of how precisely this experience should be\nconstrued and on several related matters.\n\nOne significant divide is between those who believe that temporally\nextended phenomena really do figure in our immediate experience, and\nthose who deny this. To coin some terminology:\n\n\nPhenomeno-temporal Realism (PT-realism,\nhenceforth further abbreviated to realism): change,\nsuccession and persistence can be directly perceived or\napprehended.\n\nPhenomeno-temporal Antirealism\n(PT-antirealism, henceforth further abbreviated to\nantirealism): change, succession and persistence\ncannot be directly perceived or apprehended.\n\n\nThe extensional and retentional models are currently the two most\ninfluential forms of realism, with both approaches being developed in\na variety of different ways. The task facing antirealists is in one\nrespect the easier of the two: unlike their realist counterparts, they\nare under no obligation to provide an intelligible account of how it\nis possible for our consciousness to embrace seemingly temporally\nextended phenomena. But in another respect their task is the more\ndifficult. Antirealists are under an obligation to \u201csave the\n(temporal) phenomena\u201d: they need to supply a credible\nexplanation as to why so many of us find it so natural to say\nwe perceive movement and change if in fact we don\u2019t. After all,\nit does seem perfectly natural to hold that we can see clouds\nmove across the sky, feel water flowing through our fingers and hear\nmelodies. This is the task facing those cinematic\ntheorists\u2014e.g., Chuard (2017)\u2014who hold that we do not\ndirectly perceive change or succession but who also accept that we\nseem to.\n\nRealists generally maintain that it is important to distinguish the\nexperience of succession from a mere succession of\nexperiencings. An experience of succession involves a direct\nexperience of change or persistence; there is no guarantee that a\nsequence of distinct momentary (or very brief) experiences will\nconstitute an experience with this character even if these experiences\noccur successively and belong to the same person. If the experiencing\nof a tone C and a tone D are two entirely separate experiential\nepisodes they won\u2019t jointly constitute an experiencing of the\nsuccession C-being-followed-by-D. An experience of succession\ninvolves a temporal spread of contents being presented\ntogether in consciousness, albeit in the form of a perceived\nsuccession rather than simultaneously.\n\nIn an influential treatment of these topics Izchak Miller (1984)\nsuggests that philosophical thinking on temporal consciousness has\nbeen influenced\u2014overtly or only covertly\u2014by two\nprinciples. Miller calls the first of these the \u201cPrinciple of\nPresentational Concurrence\u201d (PPC), which he formulates thus:\n\n\nThe duration of a content being presented is concurrent with the\nduration of the act of presenting it. That is, the time interval\noccupied by a content which is before the mind is the very same time\ninterval which is occupied by the act of presenting that very content\nbefore the mind. (I. Miller 1984: 107)\n\n\nThe \u201cact-content\u201d conception of the structure of\nconsciousness that Miller\u2019s formulation presupposes is not one\nto which everyone will want to subscribe, but the basic thesis\nencapsulated in PPC looks highly\n plausible.[4]\n If we watch a traffic light change from red to green it is natural to\nthink that we see the red light before we see the green light, and\nthat\u2014more generally\u2014our awareness of these events unfolds\nconcurrently with the events. Of the three conceptions of the nature\nof temporal experience we encountered in\n \u00a71.1\n the extensional model most clearly conforms with PPC\u2014and for\nthat reason has a prima facie plausibility.\n\nMiller\u2019s second principle is less intuitively plausible, at\nleast on first acquaintance. Miller calls it the \u201cPrinciple of\nSimultaneous Awareness\u201d (PSA):\n\n\nNo succession of awarenesses\u2014no matter how close together in\ntime they come\u2014can, by itself, account for an awareness of\nsuccession; it must be the case that an awareness of succession\nderives from simultaneous features of the structure of that awareness.\nFor instance, an awareness of the succession of, say, two tones (or\ntone-qualities) must involve simultaneous awareness of both tones (or\ntone-qualities). (I. Miller 1984: 109)\n\n\nSome elements of Miller\u2019s formulation could be clearer. Phillips\nexpresses the basic idea more succinctly and more clearly:\n\nPSA: If one is aware of a succession or duration, one\nis necessarily aware of it at one moment. (2014b:\n 140)[5]\n\nIf PSA is true our awareness of the traffic light changing from red to\ngreen does not run concurrently with the event itself, it\noccurs at a single moment, and so runs counter to PPC. To the extent\nthat PPC seems intuitively plausible, PSA seems implausible. However\ndespite this\u2014as we shall see in\n \u00a74\u2014an\n impressive number of philosophers and psychologists have rejected PPC\nand subscribed to PSA. Why has the latter principle seemed plausible?\nIn part because it provides an answer to the question raised a moment\nago that many realists have found compelling: \u201cHow does an\nexperience of succession differ from a succession of\nexperiences?\u201d For further discussion of these principles and\ntheir motivations see Dainton (2000: \u00a75.6), Rashbrook (2013a),\nHoerl (2009), and Phillips (2010, 2014b).\n",
