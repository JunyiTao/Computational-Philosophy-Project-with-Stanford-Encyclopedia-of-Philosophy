    "main_text": "Things and Realities || The Reality of Realities\n4.2 The Reality of Realities\n\nIbn al-\u2018Arab\u00ee calls the word shay\u2019, thing,\n\u201cone of the most indefinite of the indefinites\u201d (min\nankar al-nakir\u00e2t), because it can refer to anything\nwhatsoever, existent or nonexistent, real or unreal. Nonetheless, he\ntells us that he avoids using it in reference to God because God does\nnot use it to name himself. He does call God an entity, however,\nespecially in the phrase \u201cthe One Entity\u201d\n(al-\u2018ayn al-w\u00e2hida), typically in contexts that\nbring to mind what the later tradition sometimes called the doctrine\nof the Oneness of Being. For example:\n\nThrough Him we [existent entities] become manifest to Him and to us.\nIn one respect we are through Him, but He is not through us, since He\nis the Manifest, and we remain with our own root [i.e., nonexistence],\neven if we bestow\u2014through the preparedness of our\nentities\u2014certain affairs that belong to our entities, and even\nif we are named by names that the veiled person supposes to be our\nnames, such as Throne, Footstool, Intellect, Soul, nature, sphere,\nbody, earth, heaven, water, air, fire, inanimate object, plant,\nanimal, and jinn. All this belongs to One Entity, nothing else. (Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee, al-Fut\u00fbh\u00e2t, 1911 edition,\n1:691.14)\n\n\nIbn \u2018Arab\u00ee does in fact refer to God as a thing in one\npassage of an early work, and this has caught the attention of several\nobservers, because he mentions there \u201cthe third thing\u201d, a\nnotion that seems to throw light on his whole approach (Takeshita\n1982, Bashier 2004). At first he seems to be talking in the standard\nAvicennan language of necessity and possibility, but then he brings up\nthe notion of barzakh to explain how these two can be\ninterrelated. Things, he says, can be divided into three sorts. The\nfirst sort is qualified by wuj\u00fbd in its very essence,\nand this is the Necessary Being, God, who is nondelimited in existence\n(mutlaq al-wuj\u00fbd) and who bestows existence on all\nthings. The second sort is existent (mawj\u00fbd) through\nGod, namely delimited existence (al-wuj\u00fbd al-muqayyad),\nwhich is the cosmos, everything other than God. \u201cAs for the\nThird Thing\u201d, he writes:\n\nit is qualified neither by existence nor by nonexistence, neither by\nnew arrival nor by eternity\u2026. The cosmos becomes manifest from\nthis Third Thing, for this thing is the Reality of the Universal\nRealities of the cosmos, which are intelligible to the mind\u2026.\nIf you say that this thing is the cosmos, you speak the truth, and if\nyou say that it is the Eternal Real, you speak the truth. If you say\nthat it is neither the cosmos nor the Real but rather an added\nmeaning, you speak the truth. (Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee,\nInsh\u00e2\u2019, 16\u201317)\n\n\nGiven the detailed description of the Third Thing provided in the full\npassage, it is clear that Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee is discussing\nNondelimited Imagination as the Supreme Barzakh. The Third Thing,\nhowever, never became established as a technical term, in contrast to\nthe synonym that he mentions in this same passage, the Reality of\nRealities, also called the Universal Reality and the Muhammadan\nReality. Reality (haq\u00eeqa), as already noted, is used to\nmean entity, quiddity, thing, and possible thing, though it is\ncommonly used more broadly as well. Thus God\u2019s Koranic names are\ncalled realities, but not entities or things.\n\nThere is no existent possible thing in everything other than God that\nis not connected to the divine relations and lordly realities that are\nknown as the Most Beautiful Names. Therefore every possible thing is\nin the grasp of a divine reality. (Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee,\nal-Fut\u00fbh\u00e2t, 1911 edition, 2:115.27)\n\n\nBy mentioning \u201cuniversal\u201d realities in talking about the\nThird Thing, Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee means the divine names and\nattributes, which become manifest through the particular realities,\nthe entities. He has in view a version of the Tree of Porphyry, though\nhe never uses the expression: Each individual (leaf) is a member of a\nspecies (twig), which in turn belongs to a genus (branch), and so on,\nuntil all are eventually subsumed under the genus of the genera, the\nReality of Realities. This Reality is neither the Necessary Being nor\nthe cosmos. In God it is the divine knowledge of all things, and as\nsuch is eternal; in the cosmos, it is the ever-changing totality that\nis temporal creation. Drawing from terminology he uses elsewhere, his\nfollowers call this Reality in God \u201cthe Most Holy\nEffusion\u201d (al-fayd al-aqdas), and they define it as\nGod\u2019s self-disclosure to himself in himself, or the\nself-knowledge by which he knows every concomitant of his own\ninfinity. They contrast it with \u201cthe Holy Effusion\u201d\n(al-fayd al-muqaddas), the creative act that brings all\nrealities and entities into manifestation.\n",
