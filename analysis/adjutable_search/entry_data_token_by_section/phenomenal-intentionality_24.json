    "main_text": "Challenges for PIT || Standing propositional attitudes\n6.2 Standing propositional attitudes\n\nStanding propositional attitudes are states one is in independently of\nwhat one is thinking about or experiencing at the time (i.e., independently\nof one\u2019s occurrent states). For example, five minutes ago you\nhad the standing belief that monkeys like bananas even though you\nweren\u2019t occurrently thinking that content. Standing\npropositional attitudes do not seem to have phenomenal properties, and\nso, it seems their intentionality is not phenomenal\nintentionality.\n\nAs far as we can tell, no one has applied the inflationist strategy to\nstanding propositional attitudes\u2014no one claims that they are\nphenomenal intentional states. \n\nStrawson (2008) and Mendelovici (2010, 2018) adopt the eliminativist\nstrategy as part of their defenses of PIT: they deny that standing\nbeliefs and other standing propositional attitudes are intentional\nstates. As Strawson puts it, \u201cTo have a belief is not to be in\nany contentful mental state.\u201d (p. 271) Rather, it is to be\ndisposed to be in such a state. Horgan & Tienson (2002)\nare not eliminativists about the intentionality of standing states,\nbut they do not consider them part of the scope of their version of\nPIT. \n\nSearle (1990, 1991, 1992), Bourget (2010), and Kriegel (2011a,b) favor\nderivativism about standing states. Searle holds that non-phenomenal\nintentional states have their intentionality in virtue of\nsubjects\u2019 dispositions to have conscious states. This account\napplies most naturally to standing propositional attitudes. Bourget\n(2010) holds a similar but more nuanced view according to which\nstanding propositional attitudes derive from connections to occurrent\nthoughts, which themselves either are phenomenal intentional states or\nderive their contents from distinct phenomenal intentional states (see\nthe next section on the derivativist strategy for thoughts).\n\nThe simple derived content approach defended by Searle and Bourget is\nopen to well-known objections. One of these objections, discussed by\nPeacocke (1998), is that a state that causes occurrent thoughts to the\neffect that P is not a belief that P unless it is\naccompanied by the right behavior. Imagine someone who claims not to\nbe sexist and tends to form occurrent non-sexist thoughts but who\nbehaves in demonstrably sexist ways. Such an individual is naturally\nsaid to have unconscious sexist beliefs.\n\nKriegel\u2019s (2011a,b) account aims to explain standing states and\nunconscious occurrent states in a unified way. On his account, which\nhe calls interpretivism, a non-phenomenal state s has\na certain derived intentional content C just in case an ideal\ninterpreter is disposed to ascribe C to s. An ideal\ninterpreter is a being that is perfectly rational and knows all the\nphenomenal and non-phenomenal (but not derivatively intentional) facts\nabout the world. On the resulting derivativist view, non-phenomenal\nintentional states derive from an ideal interpreter\u2019s phenomenal\nintentional states.\n\nThe disagreement between eliminativism and derivativism about standing\nstates might be partly terminological. Most of the above-mentioned\ntheorists agree that standing states are a matter of a certain kind of\ndisposition to have phenomenal states. What they disagree on is\nwhether the potentially conscious or dispositional states count as\nintentional states. \n",
