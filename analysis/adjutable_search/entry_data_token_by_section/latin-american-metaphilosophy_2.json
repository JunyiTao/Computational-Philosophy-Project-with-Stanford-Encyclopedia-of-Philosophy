    "main_text": "Preliminaries || Origins\n1.2 Origins\n\nWhen did philosophy begin in Latin America? Any answer to this\nquestion would depend in part to whether one is asking about the\nbeginning of academic or non-academic philosophy. There is consensus\nthat some form of academic philosophy, mostly connected with teaching,\nexisted during the colonial period. An example of a successful work\nfrom this early period is L\u00f3gica mexicana, a textbook\nby the Mexican Antonio Rubio (1548\u20131615) widely used at the\ntime, even in Spain. But it was not until the early twentieth century\nthat philosophy acquired contemporary scholarly dimensions, including\nstandard institutional manifestations.\n\nAn interesting metaphilosophical issue related to the origin of Latin\nAmerican philosophy is whether the philosophical thought of\nPre-Colombian cultures also belongs in the non-academic tradition.\nNeedless to say, pre-Columbian thought unfolds in ways that seem\nutterly alien to our current standards about the form, content, or\nmethod method typical of philosophical work. But compliance with any\nsuch standards falls short of being a necessary condition for a work\nto count as philosophical. After all, the works of Pythagoras and the\nother Pre-Socratics are quite unorthodox in those respects yet\nconsidered philosophical. And contemporary examples too are not far to\nseek. Wittgenstein immediately comes to mind. A number of Latin\nAmerican philosophers are now prepared to agree with Peruvian\nFrancisco Mir\u00f3 Quesada that \u201c[i]n a broad sense,\nphilosophy has always existed in Latin America. The Maya and the Inca\nhad thought that, without abusing the terms, may be considered of\nphilosophical character\u2026.\u201d (1978, p. 75, my translation).\nTextual evidence of the existence of philosophical thought among the\nAztecs has been provided and analyzed by a number of experts. For\nexample, Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan (1499\u20131590), a Spanish\nfriar turned into amateur ethnologist, and contemporary philosophers\nsuch as Mexican Miguel Le\u00f3n Portilla (1963) and American James\nMaffie (2009, 2014).\n\nNuccetelli (2011) considers pre-Columbian works of philosophical\nimport to be part of Latin American proto-philosophy of the\nnon-academic variety. Gracia\u2019s (2008) understanding of Latin\nAmerican philosophy as ethnic philosophy (more on this later) can also\naccommodate pre-Columbian philosophical works within that discipline.\nBut Gracia (especially in his 2010) defers taking a position on\nwhether works such as the Maya folk-cosmology in the Popol\nVuh count as Latin American philosophy until proper historical\nwork can provide more stable and widely accepted answers about what\nfalls within that ethnic philosophy and what doesn\u2019t.\n",
