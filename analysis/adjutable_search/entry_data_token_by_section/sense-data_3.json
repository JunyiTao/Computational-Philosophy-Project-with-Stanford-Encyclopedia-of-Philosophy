E. Moore and Bertrand\n Russell.[11]\n The background to this development includes not only the problem of\nthe external world but also their early and joint commitment to\nBritish Idealism. The affirmation of sense data denied a central tenet\nof such idealism, that perception yields no knowledge because it is\nalways an incomplete grasping of the whole or the Absolute. As Russell\nput it, looking back from 1943:\n\n\nBradley argued that everything common sense believes in is mere\nappearance; we reverted to the opposite extreme, and thought that\neverything is real that common sense, uninfluenced by\nphilosophy or theology, supposes real. With a sense of escaping from\nprison, we allowed ourselves to think that grass is green, that the\nsun and stars would exist if no one was aware of them, and also that\nthere is a pluralistic timeless world of Platonic ideas. (1951:\n12)\n\n\nAs we shall see, the realism that Russell affirms here is in some\nrespects peculiar, for in one version it includes a denial of\nmind-independent material things, but without embracing idealism.\n\nMoore first developed the concept of sense data. His conception\nprimarily focused on epistemology, whereas Russell combined\nepistemology with various metaphysical schemes for building from sense\n data.[12]\n2.2.1 Moore and Sense Data\n\nMoore broke with idealism in 1898 and his \u201cRefutation of\nIdealism\u201d appeared in 1903. This paper did not introduce the\nconcept of sense data, but it formulated the distinction that made him\na realist, which he maintained throughout his life, between the act of\nsensation and its object. Moore contended that every case of sensation\ninvolves awareness of two distinct elements, one common to all\nsensations and the other differing among them. He distinguished the\ncommon element, which he called \u201cconsciousness\u201d, from the\ndiffering \u201cobjects\u201d of sensation, which might be blue in\none case, green in another. He did not claim to prove that the object\nis what it seems to be: a material object at a distance, but he\nendorsed a na\u00efve realism, according to which we are directly\naware of \u201cthe existence of a table in space\u201d just as we\nare directly aware of the conscious element (1903: 453).\n\nIn December, 1909, Moore gave a paper at the Aristotelian Society in\nwhich he introduced the term \u201csense\n data\u201d.[13]\n The paper again divided \u201cmental acts\u201d from their objects,\nand it observed that we are aware of a difference between mental act\nand non-mental object: when we perceive one color and then another,\nthe act of consciousness is of the same type, whereas the two colors\nthat are objects of the act differ. Such acts of consciousness can\nthemselves differ in quality (one mental act may be a perceiving,\nanother a willing, etc.), and many mental acts may be conjoined to\nform a complex mental entity. But such acts are distinct from their\nobjects, even if those objects exist only when we perceive them, as,\nMoore reports, some people believe about colors. He then introduces\nthe term \u201csense data\u201d:\n\n\nBy sense-data I understand a class of entities of which we are very\noften directly conscious, and with many of which we are extremely\nfamiliar. They include the colours, of all sorts of different shades,\nwhich I actually see when I look about me; the sounds which I actually\nhear; the peculiar sort of entity of which I am directly conscious\nwhen I feel the pain of a toothache, and which I call \u201cthe\npain\u201d; and many others which I need not enumerate. But I wish\nalso to include among them those entities called \u201cimages\u201d,\nof which I am directly conscious when I dream and often also when\nawake; which resemble the former in respect of the fact that they\nare colours, sounds, etc.; but which seem, as a rule, like\nrather faint copies of the colours, sounds, etc., actually seen or\nheard, and which, whether fainter or not, differ from them in respect\nof the fact that we should not say we actually saw or heard them, and\nthe fact that they are not, in the strictest sense of the words,\n\u201cgiven by the senses\u201d. All these entities I propose to\ncall sense-data. And in their case there is, of course, no question\nwhether there are such entities. The entities meant certainly\nare, whether or not they be rightly described as\n\u201csensations\u201d, \u201csense-presentations\u201d,\n\u201csense-data\u201d, etc. Here the only question can be, whether\nthey are \u201cmental\u201d. (1909\u201310: 57)\n\n\nMoore\u2019s remarks are not in the spirit of arguing that\nsense data exist but of drawing our attention to their\nobvious existence; his argument concerns whether they are mental.\nMoore observes (1909\u201310: 58) that philosophers such as Stout\nregard sense data as mental because they fail to distinguish act from\nobject, consciousness of blue from the blue of which we are conscious.\nHaving made this distinction between act and object, he finds it\nmanifest that the object is non-mental (1909\u201310:\n58\u201360).\n\nMoore intended the term \u201csense data\u201d to provide a neutral\ndescription for whatever is the immediate object of our awareness and\nhence to be neutral on the problem of the external world. Over the\nnext half century, he considered various theories about how sense data\nmight relate to physical objects. In these discussions, he sometimes\nused \u201csensibles\u201d as a broader term that includes unsensed\nsense-data (1913\u201314: 357\u2013358). Without following the\nvarious shifts in his preferred theory, we can note that he considered\nfive relations that sense data might have to physical objects or other\nactual or potential causes (Moore 1913\u201314, 1918\u201319, 1925,\n1957). On one conception, physical objects might be regarded as\n\ncollections of sensed and unsensed sense data,\nindependent of any conception of the causal source of such data.\n\n\nBringing in potential causes of sense data, these might be:\n\na spiritual entity, as in Berkeleyan idealism;\nan unknown thing in itself; or\nphysical objects, as in Locke\u2019s view of\nrepresentative realism.\n\n\nFinally, a sense datum might be\n\na part of the surface of a physical object.\n\n\nMoore (1913\u201314: 376) identified (1) with Russell and Mill (e.g.,\nRussell 1914a, b) and allowed that it might be right. But he favored\npositions (4) and (5). In (4), sense data stand in a relation to\nphysical objects, called \u201crelation R\u201d, which turns out to\nbe a representational relation (Moore 1925, 1957). In (5), the\nperceiver is directly aware of a part of the surface of a physical\nobject.\n\nIn discussing sense data, Moore introduced some facts that illustrate\nthe relativity of perception, using coins (1913\u201314:\n371\u2013372). With U.S. coins, a penny is physically smaller than a\nquarter and both are round. Moore and other observers report that when\nlooking at the coins from a position other than directly above them,\nthey appear more or less elliptical, becoming thin rectangles when\nseen edge-on. Further, the quarter, seen at a sufficiently greater\ndistance than the penny, appears smaller than it. Moore wanted to\naccount for these purported facts that exhibit perceptual relativity,\nwhile preserving the common-sense beliefs that we really do, on some\noccasions, see coins; that the coins really are round; that they have\nan inside and a lower side, even though these aren\u2019t presently\nseen; that the quarter is really larger than the penny; and that the\ncoins exist when we aren\u2019t looking at them.\n\nPosition (4),\n a form of representative\n realism,[14]\n accounts for the perceptual relativity that makes us want to\ndistinguish the immediate object of perception from the properties we\nascribe to physical objects (Perceptual Variation). The immediate\nobject is elliptical; the penny, round. Although accommodating\nrelativity, this position may be challenged for making it difficult to\nknow the properties of the physical object, for the object is once\nremoved from perception. But Moore (1913\u201314: 379\u2013380) was\nnot swayed by this challenge, generally aligning himself with common\nsense beliefs about physical objects.\n\nPosition (5)\n equates the sense datum with a portion of the surface of the physical\nobject. In order to account for perceptual relativity, Moore\n(1918\u201319: 23\u201324) now violates a basic tenet concerning\nsense data: that we perceive them as they are\n (item 3 of the Classical Notion).\n If the penny is round and we are directly aware of its physical\nsurface, even when viewed at an angle, we are perceiving a round\nthing. But, Moore holds, the round thing is perceived to\n\u201cseem\u201d elliptical. It is not perceived to be\nelliptical, as in the other four positions, and as Moore himself had\npreviously assumed (1918\u201319: 23). Hence, in holding (5), one\nmust distinguish the actual properties of the directly seen surface\nfrom the properties it seems to have (1918\u201319: 24). There is no\nactually elliptical datum; rather, the circular datum simply seems to\nbe elliptical. Moore did his best to uphold the direct realism of (5)\nand at times favored it. But in his final publication (1957), he\nendorsed\n (4)\n instead.\n2.2.2 Russell and Sense Data\n\nIn 1911\u20131912, Russell returned to a project he had started soon\nafter the break from Idealism, an investigation of the concept of\nmatter. A need to first secure the foundations of mathematics had\ndiverted him from this project (and resulted in Principia).\nNow, from 1912 on, he approached the analysis of matter from the\nperspectives of epistemology and ontology, investigating our knowledge\nand conception of the fundamental constituents of the external world.\nThe main events concerning sense data proper run from the Problems\nof Philosophy (1912) to the Analysis of Mind (1921),\nalthough the legacy of sense data extends further.\n\nRussell\u2019s initial discussions in this period made epistemology\nprimary. Consider the opening sentence of his 1912 popular book,\nThe Problems of Philosophy:\n\n\nIs there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no\nreasonable man could doubt it? (1912 [1997: 7])\n\n\nThe first positive instance he offers is knowledge of sense data.\n\nRussell finds that when he looks at an object such as a table, his\nperception of the table does not reveal the actual properties of the\ntable but rather a series of sensations that vary in what they\npresent. The character of color sensations change as one moves around\na table, sometimes being brown, but in cases of reflected light (say,\nfrom a window), giving a sensation of white. The shape of the table\nappears as a sequence of quadrilaterals; viewed from one end, it\nappears as a regular trapezoid, and the physically parallel sides\nyield a sense experience of convergence. Russell argues for the\nexistence of sense data with a version of the Argument from Perceptual\nVariation, which, for shape, runs as follows (1912 [1997:\n10\u201311]):\n\nIn looking at a table, what we see varies in shape as we\nmove.\nThe real table does not vary in shape.\nHence, what we see is not the real table.\n\n\nHe offers similar arguments for color and felt properties such as\nhardness.\n\nRussell gives the name \u201csense data\u201d to\n\n\nthe things that are immediately known in sensation: such things as\ncolours, sounds, smells, hardnesses, roughnesses, and so on. (1912\n[1997: 12])\n\n\nIn further discussion, he affirms or implies the eight elements of the\nClassical Notion. He further suggests that sense data may exist only\nwhen sensed (1912 [1997: 23]). Like Moore, he emphasizes the\nimportance of distinguishing between the mental act of sensation and\nthe object of that act (1912 [1997: 12]). The act is mental, the\nobject need not be. Like Moore as well, he suggests that those who\nbelieve that sense data must be mental have failed to distinguish act\nfrom object (1912 [1997: 41\u201343]).\n\nRussell further asks whether the table is real and, if so, what it\nmight be (1912 [1997: 11, 19\u201325]). He answers that the table\nmost likely is a real material object, rectangular and brown.\nAccordingly, he assigns to material objects the role of causing sense\ndata. Sense data then \u201crepresent\u201d the objects that cause\nthem (1912 [1997: 23]). This is not part of the base concept of sense\ndata but is the result of further analysis. He has posited sense data\nas \u201cthird things\u201d, standing between material objects and\nperceivers, and serving as the immediate objects of perception.\n\nIn Problems, Russell distinguished knowledge by acquaintance,\nwhich involves a direct relation to sense data, from knowledge by\ndescription or \u201cknowledge that\u201d. Although bare\nacquaintance makes us aware of the properties of sense data, it does\nnot assert any truths or involve any judgments, hence does not\nconstitute \u201cknowledge that\u201d something is the case (1912\n[1997: 46]). We come to know basic facts about sense data by making\njudgments about them. In obtaining sense data of a brown table, we\neasily come to know that we are seeing something brown, or,\nsubsequently, a whitish sheen, or an appearance of one or another\ntrapezoidal surface. This is what Russell calls \u201cknowledge of\nthings by description\u201d (1912 [1997: 46]). Description\nis only possible if we have access to universals, such as brownness,\nwhiteness, being a surface, being a trapezoid, and so on. According to\nRussell, repeated sensations allow us to become acquainted with\nsensory universals:\n\n\nWhen we see a white patch, we are acquainted, in the first instance,\nwith the particular patch; but by seeing many white patches, we easily\nlearn to abstract the whiteness which they all have in common, and in\nlearning to do this we are learning to be acquainted with whiteness.\n(1912 [1997: 101])\n\n\nHaving acquaintance with universals such as whiteness, we can make\njudgments that yield knowledge by description of the properties of\nthings. These are judgments of fact about sense data, which establish\ntruths.\n\nGoing forward, Russell retained the view that sense data (or their\ncounterparts) provide epistemological bedrock. But within a year or\nso, in Our Knowledge of the External World (1914a) and\n\u201cThe Relation of Sense-data to Physics\u201d (1914b), he\nchanged position on the metaphysics of sense data in relation to\nmaterial objects. He came to view such objects as logical\nconstructions out of sense data. He found no need to assert the\nexistence of material objects, whether the substantial\n\u201cthing\u201d of common sense or the atoms and molecules of\nphysics (1914b: 109, 114\u2013115). Rather, he populated the world\nwith minds and sense data and new entities termed\n\u201csensibilia\u201d. Things and micro-physical particles became\nlogical constructions, not inferred entities as in his representative\nrealism of 1912. This adjustment may be seen as an extension of his\nrecognition that sense data are very well known. Treating material\nobjects as mere logical constructions avoids a shaky inference from\nwell-known data to the actual existance of physical things.\n\nDuring this development, Russell retained and clarified his conception\nof occurrent sense data, including the eight points of the Classical\nNotion. He retained the distinction between mental act and non-mental\nobject (1914a: 76; 1914b: 113). Sense data are non-mental, but they\nexist as sense data only while they are present to the mind (1914a:\n64; 1914b: 110). He now identified two additional entities, inferred\nrather than constructed, that would figure into his account of the\nexternal world: other people\u2019s sense data, inferred from their\ntestimony and ultimately relying on analogy with one\u2019s own mind\nto posit other minds; and\n\n\nthe \u201csensiblia\u201d which would appear from places where there\nhappen to be no minds, and which I suppose to be real although they\nare no one\u2019s data. (1914b: 116)\n\n\nSensibilia, as postulated entities, are particulars that become sense\ndata when a perceiver enters into a relation of acquaintance with one\nof them. Thus, there are many potential trapezoidal appearances as of\na table. When someone has a sequence of table-like experiences, some\nof those trapezoidal appearances are manifest as sense data. At other\nperspectives, not occupied by any observer, there are unsensed\nparticulars. As Russell put it:\n\n\nI shall give the name sensibilia to those objects which have\nthe same metaphysical and physical status as sense-data without\nnecessarily being data to any mind. (1914b: 110)\n\n\nThe notion of \u201cobject\u201d here is not that of an ordinary\nphysical object. Rather, as the objects of sensation, Russell posits a\nbevy of fleeting particulars, the exact time course of which he\ndidn\u2019t specify.\n\nRussell\u2019s analysis of our perception of an external world\nadvanced in other ways. In Problems (1912: ch. 1), he had\nnoted that we are so accustomed to judging the \u201creal\u201d\nshapes of things that we believe \u201cthat we actually see the real\nshapes\u201d (1912 [1997: 10]), that is, we uncritically assume that\nwe see the table as rectangular. But when we adopt the attitude needed\nto produce a drawing of the table, we may come to notice the\nappearances of various trapezoidal shapes. In Our Knowledge\n(1914a: ch. 3), Russell further analyzes this difference. His analysis\ndepends on the relation between what is logically and psychologically\nprimitive or else derivative. Logically primitive beliefs are those\nthat are not logically derived via inference or construction. In order\nto strengthen our knowledge, we seek to align these primitive beliefs\nwith the psychologically primitive. While having an ordinary\nperception of the table with its actual shape, we mistakenly believe\nthat this experience, which has resulted from a learned psychological\nprocess, is psychologically primitive; accordingly, we also designate\nthis perception of the table as logically primitive. Scientific\npsychology now offers a point that Russell had attributed to learning\nto draw: that what is actually psychologically primitive is the\nperspectival view of the table as trapezoidal (1914a: 68). Armed with\nthis psychological finding, we endeavor to make the trapezoidal datum\nlogically primitive; what is psychologically primitive is more secure\nand so provides us with \u201chard data\u201d by comparison with the\n\u201csoft data\u201d of the common-sense belief about the\ntable\u2019s shape (1914a: 69\u201370). As with Mill\u2019s\napparently but not actually intuitive beliefs, before epistemological\nanalysis many beliefs about sensory things are logically primitive,\nbecause not reached through logical derivation, and psychologically\nderivative, because caused by extra-logical psychological processes\nsuch as association. Upon further consideration, we favor beliefs that\nare both psychologically and logically primitive (1914a: 69\u201370)\nand so establish sense data as logically primitive.\n\nRussell\u2019s postulation of sensibilia allowed him to gain in\nmetaphysical regularity and economy. Sensibilia make it that the\nobjects of sense, color patches and like, do not simply go out of\nexistence when unobserved. Rather, sensibilia persist and we sample\nthem when we occupy positions that present specific\ntable-perspectives. But, further, he economizes by replacing the\n\u201creal\u201d physical table with sense data and sensibilia at\nvarious locations. These are coordinated between the senses, and so\ninclude those as of approaching the table with our eye until our face\ntouches it, a perspective that connects with the felt location of\ntable (1914b: 119\u2013120).\n\nBy 1920, Russell proposed even greater ontological economy by giving\nup mental acts and the experiencing subject as distinct from sense\ndata. This meant that the \u201cdata\u201d were no longer given to a\ndistinct subject and so were improperly named as \u201csense\ndata\u201d; henceforth, he spoke of \u201cmomentary\nparticulars\u201d or \u201cevents\u201d. He explicated this\n\u201cneutral monism\u201d in the Analysis of Mind (1921:\nch. 1). He saw himself as adopting James\u2019s (1904) position,\naccording to which both the self and the external world are composed\nof one neutral stuff\u2014momentary particulars, characterized by\nperceptual qualities such as color and shape (for visual particulars).\nAccordingly, he discarded the act-object analysis of mind and sense\nperception, as there is no longer recognition of a mind that acts but\nonly of various sequences of momentary particulars. The sequence that\nincludes all the experiences that I\u2019ve had today (and before)\nconstitutes my mind, another sequence of such particulars constitutes\nyour mind. Physical objects, such as a table, become a different\nsequence of particulars, which are like sensibilia in giving\nperspectives on a table or a room that is composed of them. If no\none\u2019s sequence of particulars intersects with those of a\nparticular classroom, then that room and its contents consist of a\nseries of momentary particulars now occurring without anyone present.\nThe material entities of physics are, as before, treated as\nconstructions from momentary\n particulars.[15]\n2.2.3 Further Development of the Classical Notion of Sense Data\n\nMany other classical theorists accepted the view that sense data are\nnon-mental. Broad (1923) and Price (1932) were realists who\nacknowledged both sense data and material objects. Broad explored a\n\u201ccritical scientific realism\u201d by elaborating the notion of\nsense data (or, in his terms, \u201csensa\u201d) from Russell and\nothers. His position was in some ways similar to traditional\nrepresentative realism, but Broad denied that sensa are themselves\nmental states, in the sense of being dependent on the mind for their\nexistence (1923: 265\u2013266), and, further, he denied that physical\nobjects are inferred from sensa. Rather, sensing sensa induces an\nunderived belief in mind-independent physical objects, a belief that\nis not reached by inference and cannot be justified by inference\n(1923: 268). Broad agreed with Russell\u2019s point that, in ordinary\nperceptual consciousness, sense data are not manifest but may become\nso through an act of attention. He rejected the picture that we first\nfocus on sensa and then explicitly infer objects and their properties\nfrom them; rather, we \u201cpass automatically\u201d, by a primitive\nfeature of our psychology, from sensa (perhaps unnoticed) to judgments\nabout objects and their properties (1923: 246\u2013248).\n\nPrice\u2019s book, Perception (1932), is an especially\nprobing account of sense data, their ontological status and cognitive\nrole. He begins by isolating a sense datum as what is given in\nperception such that we cannot doubt its existence: the extant bulgy\npatch of red that occurs when a tomato is viewed in good light cannot\nbe doubted, even if we can doubt whether we are seeing a tomato or\nindeed any physical object at all (1932: 3). The bulgy patch is\ndirectly present in consciousness, that is, is \u201cgiven\u201d as\na datum by means of a relation of mental acquaintance. Price, as has\nbeen mentioned, recommended that the term \u201csense data\u201d\nshould be considered, in its meaning, neutral on ontology. But he went\non to argue for a specific conception of what sense data are,\nincluding a specification of their cognitive status and their ontology\nas a tertium quid.\n\nAgainst the \u201ccausal\u201d theory of perception (effectively,\nrepresentative realism), Price argues that the concept of cause is\nneither necessary nor sufficient for our belief in physical objects,\nthat even in spatial perception only in some cases do sense data\nresemble physical objects, and that in any case material objects are\nnot inferred from sense data. He further maintains that although sense\ndata are distinct from material objects (contra na\u00efve realism)\nand their existence may require the existence of minds, they are not\nmental (1932: 117\u2013127, 316\u2013317). He elaborates notions of\nperceptual acceptance and perceptual assurance to describe the\nnon-inferential cognitive acts through which we accept and believe\nthat material objects exist. The belief in material objects consists\nin (a) the construction of a \u201cstandard solid\u201d from sense\ndata, which is a spatial structure that fits the outer shape of a\nphysical object in three dimensions, together with (b) belief in a\ncausally efficacious \u201cphysical occupant\u201d of this location\n(1932: ch.\n 8).[16]\n\nPrice (1932: ch. 2, esp. pp. 27\u201333) gave an early formulation of\nthe renowned Argument from Illusion as supporting sense data in\nopposition to na\u00efve realism. In this argument, if the penny looks\nelliptical or the table trapezoidal, these are illusions, since the\npenny is round and the table rectangular. Price\u2019s version of the\nArgument may be formulated as\n follows:[17]\n\nIn viewing a soccer ball in the distance, we are\nacquainted with a flat circle.\nThe surface of the soccer ball itself is spherical.\nHence, what we are acquainted with is not the surface of\nthe soccer ball. Call the object of acquaintance a sense datum.\nThe sense datum is illusory: the ball is spherical, not\nflat.\nIn walking toward and drawing near to the soccer ball,\nwe are now acquainted with a bulgy, hemispherical surface; our\nperception is now veridical.\nThere is a continuous series of perceptions of the\nball\u2019s shape as we walk, transitioning from flat to\nhemispherical.\nOur perceptual consciousness of this series exhibits no\nqualitative, phenomenal breaks when transitioning.\nIf there is no phenomenal break then there is no\nqualitative difference in the veridical and illusory experiences\nconsidered as experiences.\nIt is not plausible that qualitatively similar\nperceptions are of radically different objects, the actual surface of\nthe ball in the near case and an illusory sense datum in the distant\nand in-between cases.\nSince I am surely acquainted with a sense datum in the\ndistant case, I am acquainted with a sense datum throughout.\nHence, the direct object of perception is a sense\ndatum.\n\n\nThe argument relies on the indistinguishability of far and near\nperceptual experiences, considered as experiences, to argue that,\nsince the far experience does not directly present the object\u2019s\nsurface and shape, the near experience also does not directly present\nthat surface and shape. Price fortified the appeal to far and near\nexperiences with the observation that experiences of the ball\u2019s\nshape vary continuously with distance, which he found to tell against\nthe claim that nearby experiences of the ball are direct while other\nexperiences are mediated by sense\n data.[18]\n In addition, Price extended the argument to include cases of\nhallucination (1932: 28\u201329), which are explained by the having\nof sense data that are indistinguishable from veridical perception.\nAppealing to the phenomenal indistinguishability of various perceptual\nexperiences provides support for sense data across all three cases:\nveridical perception, illusion, and hallucination.\n\nIn subsequent discussions, this argument received much attention (see\nAyer 1940: ch. 1; Robinson 1994: ch. 2; for an overview, Smith 2002:\nch. 1). In contrast, when Russell, Moore, Broad, and others spoke of\nPerceptual Variation and the relativity of perception, they did not\ntreat the elliptical appearance of a penny as illusory. They simply\naffirmed that, from various positions, the penny looks elliptical even\nthough it is actually round. Further, although they may have alleged\nthe phenomenal indistinguishability of illusory appearances, such as\nthe bent appearance of a stick partially submerged in water, when\ncompared with ordinary appearances, this was not the basic argument\nfor sense data. Their basic argument came from Perceptual Variation\nand the lack of a match between the penny as it appears and the penny\nas they believed it to be physically.\n\nA. J. Ayer (1940), contra Price and others, argued that the existence\nof sense data is not a factual question but a matter of linguistic\nconvention. He held that all theorists of perception might agree on\nthe phenomenal facts about seeing pennies but disagree on the\nimplications for the real shapes of pennies. One theorist holds that,\nas the observer changes position, the penny appears elliptical but\nstays round; the theorist endorses sense data (by Illusion). Another\ntheorist agrees about the series of elliptical appearances with a\nmoving observer but holds that, when the penny looks elliptical, it\nhas changed shape to become elliptical (Ayer 1940: 17\u201318).\nAccording to Ayer, the competing theories can\u2019t be\ndifferentiated empirically (they agree on the elliptical appearances)\nand so they become recommendations about perceptual language. Ayer\n(1940: ch. 1) found that the Argument from Illusion supports choosing\nsense-data language. He developed the language of phenomenalism, in\nwhich statements about material objects are understood as statements\nabout actual and possible sense data (1940: ch. 5). In his scheme,\neven though sense data do not exist unsensed (possible sense data are\nmerely hypothetical), they need not be classed as mental states (1940:\n76\u201378). Ayer (1940: 61\u201365) departed from the other main\ntheorists in rejecting an act-object analysis of sensations and their\nobjects\n (item 8).\n3. Major Critical Responses or Oppositions\n\nThe topic of sense data was heavily discussed in the middle decades of\nthe twentieth century, and some notable criticisms were\n published.[19]\n\nAustin\u2019s lectures in Oxford (from 1947 on), critical of sense\ndata, were published in 1962 as Sense and Sensibilia. They\ntook aim at the doctrine that\n\n\nwe never see or otherwise perceive (or \u2018sense\u2019), or anyhow\nwe never directly perceive or sense, material objects (or material\nthings), but only sense-data. (1962: 2)\n\n\nAustin accuses Ayer (1940), Price (1932), and others of embracing a\n\u201cscholastic\u201d view that analyzes a few poorly understood\nwords and \u201chalf-studied \u2018facts\u2019\u201d. By contrast,\nhe promises to show\n\n\nthat our ordinary words are much subtler in their uses, and mark many\nmore distinctions, than philosophers have realized; and that the facts\nof perception, as discovered by, for instance, psychologists but also\nas noted by common mortals, are much more diverse and complicated than\nhas been allowed for. (1962: 3)\n\n\nAustin\u2019s criticisms focus on language use, even while dissenting\nfrom Ayer that the issues are entirely terminological (Austin 1962:\nch. 6). He focuses on the \u201cargument from illusion\u201d from\nAyer (also citing Price), and complains that ordinary cases of\nperceptual relativity and variation, such as the elliptical-looking\npenny, are not normally taken to be illusions. In fact, as we have\nseen, many earlier sense-data theorists would agree. Austin has little\nto say about the Argument from Perceptual Variation from the classical\ndiscussions. He finds the penny example to be atypical because pennies\nhave stable, sharply bounded shapes whereas many objects, such as\ncats, do not. In considering the Argument from Illusion, Austin (1962:\n52) objects to the continuity premise, which we have just seen in\nPrice: that if, in one case, we explain a mismatch between object and\nperception by introducing a special entity such as a sense datum, we\nmust then accept that in phenomenally similar cases we can\u2019t\nhave direct, veridical perception. (The continuity premise remains in\ndispute today, see Crane & French 2015 [2021].) More generally,\nsense-data theorists had argued that in describing elliptical\nappearances gained from a penny, one adopts a special sense of\n\u201csee\u201d that (1) does not require that an elliptical\nmaterial object exists, but (2) does affirm that an elliptical sense\ndatum exists (1962: ch. 3). Austin\u2019s denial that something\nelliptical must be seen in such cases draws on ordinary language. But\nPrice and others distinguished different senses of perception words\nadvisedly; Austin fails to engage their reasons more directly.\nFurther, he does not consider theorists who say that we perceive\nmaterial things as a result of sensing sense data (e.g., Broad 1923:\n248).\n\nAnother challenge to sense-data theory sought to reveal a\n\u201csense-datum fallacy\u201d (Chisholm 1957: 151\u2013152). The\ncharge is that sense-data theorists make inferences like this:\nsomething appears elliptical, therefore what we see is an appearance\nthat is\n elliptical.[20]\n The fallacy consists in simply assuming that if something appears a\ncertain way (such as Price\u2019s flat circle produced by a spherical\nball), something must exist that is that way (a sense datum). Critics\nthen argue that, in asserting that something appears elliptical (or\nflat), one might simply be describing the character of the appearance,\nnot asserting that an item with an elliptical shape (or flat surface)\nis present. Afterall, we normally do accept that things need not be as\nthey appear. In response, it has been contended that sense-data\ntheorists do not simply move from \u201cappears elliptical\u201d to\n\u201cis elliptical\u201d (Smith 2002: 35\u201336). Rather, the\npositing of sense data most commonly arises through acceptance of an\nact-object analysis of perception\n (item 8),\n which also affirms that the objects of perception are directly\napprehended\n (item 1)\n and that they are as they appear\n (item 3).\n The arguments from Variation and Illusion may then be used to contend\nthat we often experience perceptual objects whose properties are\ndistinct from the properties ascribed to material objects, as in the\npenny appearing elliptical, and that from the qualitative similarity\nof illusions (or variant appearances) and alleged direct perceptions,\nwe should conclude that we are always acquainted with sense data. Such\narguments may indeed be challenged, but there has been no simple and\nunwary move from appears such to is such.\n\nTheorists who sought to avoid this alleged fallacy held that a penny\nmight appear elliptical in a phenomenally direct way without an\nelliptical item being present to the mind. These are sometimes known\nas \u201cappearance theories\u201d. One such position is the\nadverbial analysis, which holds that phenomenal qualities inhere in\nthe mental activity of perceiving but without being present as objects\nor as property-instances. Accordingly, we perceive the penny itself,\nbut perceive it in a certain manner: roundly, or elliptically, and\nredly (Ducasse 1942; Chisholm 1957: part 3). To say that we are\nexperiencing the penny elliptically is to say that we enjoy an\nelliptical appearance without there being an actually elliptical item\npresent to us; rather, the appearance is understood simply as our\nmanner of sensing the penny, or as the way our sensory activity makes\nus experience the shape of the penny. A related sort of appearance\ntheory renders the elliptical appearance as a mental content, or an\nintentional state, with the contents elliptical and red (Barnes\n1944\u20131945). Accordingly, via intentional content, one can\nexperience an elliptical spatial structure without being acquainted\nwith an actually elliptical object. The intentional content\ninstantiates an appearance as a state of the perceiver, whose\nperceptual experience thereby represents the world as being a certain\nway, for instance, as containing an elliptical shape. (Intentionalist\ntheories are found in Dretske 1995 and Tye 1995; an important earlier\nformulation is Anscombe 1965.) These two types of theories account for\nVariation and Illusion via adverbial or intentional contents that can\nalso account for veridical cases of perception. Indeed, these theories\ncan allow that, in some instances (with moderate slant), we see a\npenny that is round by seeing it as being round and slanted relative\nto the line of sight. Adverbialists would say that we see the penny\nroundly; intentionalists, that we see the penny via mental content\nthat represents it as being round. (On these philosophies of\nperception, see Crane & French 2015 [2021].)\n\nThere is a tradition in philosophy and psychology that denies, on\nphenomenal grounds, the distinction between impoverished, typically\ntwo-dimensional sensory contents or states and the perception of\nobjects in three dimensions. One can see William James\u2019s\naffirmation that sensations are intrinsically world-directed (1890, 2:\n1\u20133) and exhibit three-dimensional volume (1890, 2:\n135\u2013136) as objecting in advance to the Classical Notion of\nsense data. James denies\n item 5,\n that sense data are neutral about a world beyond them, in favor of a\nposition that both sensation and perception give us \u201can\nimmediately present outward reality\u201d (1890, 2: 2). The Gestalt\npsychologists (Koffka 1935: chs. 1\u20133; K\u00f6hler 1929 [1947:\nchs. 1\u20133]) also adopted a position in which we are perceptually\ngiven a world, not an impoverished content or object distinct from the\nworld. They made perception of the valence or functional values of the\nworld into an immediately given aspect of perceptual content. They\nalso denied that two-dimensional sensations or sense data are the core\nfrom which perceptions are developed: the world is given in\n three-dimensions.[21]\n The Gestalt theorists drew attention to the phenomena of size and\nshape constancy. If two objects of the same size are presented at five\nand ten feet, the retinal image of the farther object will be half as\nlarge (in linear height) as the image of the nearby object; yet\nobservers report them to be phenomenally of the same size (or nearly\nso). Similarly, a circle seen at a (moderate) slant projects an\nellipse on the retina but appears circular. These theorists contended\nthat significant phenomenal differences in size between the two\nobjects, and the appearance of an elliptical shape, are produced only\nunder special laboratory conditions or through trained acts of\nattention, as might be found in those who are taught to draw (Koffka\n1935: 222\u2013223; K\u00f6hler 1929 [1947: 71\u201374]).\nSubsequently, the perceptual psychologist James J. Gibson (1950)\nagreed with the Gestalt theorists in arguing that the two-dimensional\nexperiences that are like sense data arise from acts of attention that\nartificially alter our phenomenology away from the three-dimensional\nvisual world that we normally perceive. Accordingly, the\ntwo-dimensional visual field is not an immediate object of perception\nor primitive constituent of perception that is uncovered by attention.\nRather, it is constructed through a special effort of attention.\nGibson held that, in everyday perception of a circle at a slant (say,\nyour neighbor\u2019s plate at a dinner party), the object looks like\na circle at a slant and so looks circular, not elliptical (1950: chs.\n1, 9). In subsequent writings, Gibson (1966, 1979) developed the\nnotion that sensory systems are attuned for presenting to perceivers a\nnavigable environment and its affordances for meeting the\nperceiver\u2019s needs and goals.\n\nEach of these three theoretical stances denies, on phenomenal grounds,\nthe two-fold character of perceptual consciousness, or the division\ninto impoverished sensuous element and accompanying interpretation or\nobject-positing. Rather, sensory experience is intrinsically\nworld-presenting, spatially expansive (in three dimensions), and\nutility alerting.\n\nWilfrid Sellars sought to unmask the \u201cmyth\u201d of a pure\ngiven to which subjects can respond atomistically in a way that yields\nan epistemic given (a primitive basis for knowledge). According to\nSellars\u2019s highly regarded \u201cEmpiricism and the Philosophy\nof Mind\u201d (1956), the \u201cclassical\u201d sense datum\nposition holds that \u201cs is red\u201d can be known\nnon-inferentially. Classical sense-data philosophers\n\n\nhave taken givenness to be a fact which presupposes no learning, no\nforming of associations, no setting up of stimulus-response\nconnections. (1956: \u00a76)\n\n\nThey accept an \u201cinconsistent triad\u201d:\n\n\nX senses red sense-content s entails x\nnon-inferentially knows that s is red.\nThe ability to sense sense-contents is unacquired.\nThe ability to know facts of the form x is \u03c6 is\nacquired.\n\n\nA and B together entail not-C; B and C entail not-A; A and C entail\nnot-B. (1956: \u00a76, emended)\n\n\nWho allegedly subscribed to this triad? Some of Sellars\u2019s\nexamples draw from early modern philosophy; he effectively attributes\na version of A and B to Locke, Berkeley, and Hume (1956: \u00a728)\nbut, it seems, not C. He criticizes Ayer\u2019s linguistic analysis\n(1956: \u00a7\u00a78\u20139) but suggests that it is aimed more at\nanalyzing object-talk into sense-data talk than at showing sense-data\ntalk to be epistemically basic (as in A). He briefly alludes to Broad\n(1956: \u00a711) and Price (1956: \u00a731), without ascribing the\ntriad to them. He also devotes considerable attention further on to\nthe role of an ostensive \u201cgiven\u201d within the\n\u201cpositivistic conception of science\u201d (1956: \u00a743), and\nit is tempting to surmise that his main target was that conception as\nput forward by Carnap, Reichenbach, and others. To assess that\ndirection, we would need to interpret the positivist shift from\nelementary experiences to protocol sentences as epistemically basic,\nwhich would take us far afield (but see Leitgeb & Carus 2020).\n\nIn relation to the triad, a prominent reading of Locke has him impute\nepistemic authority to sensory ideas as giving knowledge of their\ncauses (Ayers 1991: vol. 1, ch. 18). Locke is attributed A and B but\nnot C. It is doubtful that Descartes, who distinguished sensing from\njudging, would endorse A. Among the classical sense-data theorists,\nmany would deny A, distinguishing sensing and\n\u201cacquaintance\u201d from \u201cknowing that\u201d; sensing\nred may usually and non-inferentially lead to knowing that s is red,\nbut not as a simple matter of entailment. Russell explicitly denied A;\nsensing may be unacquired but \u201cknowing that\u201d involves\njudging, not mere sensing, and the universals that enter judgments of\nsensory quality (such as whiteness) are acquired, affirming C. Sellars\nhimself rejects A, complicates B, and affirms C, adopting (by\nassumption) a position of \u201cpsychological nominalism\u201d\n(1956: \u00a729), according to which kind-terms, including color\nterms, and the ability to be aware of color instances are learned as\npart of a linguistic and conceptual web of meaning (holism).\n\nIn his holism about color terms, Sellars raised an objection that\nwould engage Russell\u2019s conception of atomic statements about\nsense data as epistemically basic (Russell\u2019s psychologically and\nlogically primitive hard data). Sellars (1956) constructs an elaborate\nmyth of his own, in which our behaviorist ancestors must learn to\ntreat thoughts as internal states of one another and subsequently to\nself-report their own thoughts (1956: \u00a7\u00a747\u201359). He\nextends the story from the attribution of inner thoughts to one\nanother to the positing of internal sensory impressions (1956:\n\u00a7\u00a760\u201362). His view differs from Russell\u2019s\nposition in making the ability to be aware of red sense experiences\ndepend on the acquisition of a sophisticated web of meaning and\ntheory; this ability is not \u201cgiven\u201d. Nor, as Russell would\nhave it, is the universal red needed for knowing that s is\nred, \u201ceasily acquired\u201d (1912 [1997: 101]). Accordingly,\nthere are no easily acquired color predicates to describe the sense\ndata that ground knowledge. Sellars asserts that\n\n\ninstead of coming to have a concept of something because we have\nnoticed that sort of thing, to have the ability to notice a sort of\nthing is already to have the concept of that sort of thing, and cannot\naccount for it. (1956: \u00a745)\n\n\nSellars claims the advantage that, through this social process of\nacquisition, sense impressions lose \u201cabsolute privacy\u201d and\nbecome objects of intersubjective knowledge (1956: \u00a762), and here\nhe directly departs from\n item 7\n in the Classical Notion. But he has also rejected the acquaintance\nview of sense data as immediately present to the mind prior to\nlearning\n (item 2).\n Sellars\u2019s holistic conception that the acquisition of\nphenomenal concepts enables the ability to observe and self-report the\npresence of sense particulars may offer better reasons for rejecting\nitem 2 of the Classical Notion than are found in his discussion of the\ninconsistent triad.\n4. Sense Data Recently\n\nIn philosophies of mind and perception, sense data fell out of favor\nin the 1960s and 1970s. But there have been attempts to restore some\nversion of the theory. Often, but not always, these efforts sought to\nsustain mental sense data as the immediate objects of perception. The\nmost extensive efforts are by Frank Jackson, in Perception\n(1977), and Howard Robinson, in a book of the same title (1994).\n\nJackson set out to support the conclusion that the immediate objects\nof perception are mental and that they represent physical objects. He\nfirst argues that what we immediately perceive are sense data, which\nare colored patches. His argument appeals to the fact that when we\nperceive an object, we are not in immediate contact with the whole\nobject but only a portion of it, and that we are immediately aware of\nthe color and shape of this portion. We see the object in virtue of\nseeing its surface, and the basic form of seeing its surface is to see\nits color and shape via sense data that represent that surface. The\n\u201cin virtue of\u201d relation does all the work here; Jackson\ndoes not draw on, and rejects, the arguments from Variation and\nIllusion (1977: chs. 1, 4, 7).\n\nThis conclusion does not say whether sense data are mental or physical\n(1977: 119). The argument that sense data are all mental proceeds for\nthe case of vision by seeking to establish that colors are mental\nitems. The argument is indirect, from the conclusion that colors are\nnot physical. This conclusion, in turn, relies on the claim that color\nis not a \u201cscientific property\u201d, that only scientific\nproperties exist in the external world and affect the eyes and brain,\nand that color then can only be a mental entity caused by neural\nactivity (1977: ch. 5).\n\nThe argument relies on a conception of scientific or physical\nproperties that is widespread in philosophy: that physics has no place\nfor phenomenal properties or perceptual experience. Accordingly,\nphysics posits particles and forces, which may cause perceptual\nexperience in a suitable perceiver, but which themselves are\ncolorless. Jackson is certainly right that physics today does not\naccept something akin to phenomenal color as a fundamental physical\nproperty; rather, it accepts wavelengths and brain processes, and\nthese possess no such fundamental property. Prior to the evolution of\ncolor-sentient beings, there presumably were no phenomenal experiences\nof color, hence none to be counted among physical phenomena.\nNonetheless, physics, especially in the science of optics, accepts the\n\u201csubjective perception of color\u201d (Nelson 2017:\n125) as an object of\n study,[22]\n just as acoustics accepts the experience of pitch as a physical\nphenomenon (Weld & Palmer 1925: 322). Arguably, phenomenal\nexperiences need not be reduced or even reducible to basic physical\nprocesses in order to be counted among physical phenomena and hence\namong items to be investigated in the hard sciences, including\nphysics. Accordingly, color experience needn\u2019t be decisively\ncategorized as \u201cnon-physical\u201d. Its ultimate ontology is\nleft open. It might be a mental content as in an intentional theory or\nother appearance\n theory.[23]\n The color property might be analyzed relationally, as a surface\nproperty with the power to produce a color experience, which\nneedn\u2019t be a colored sense datum. The metaphysical status of\nphenomenal experience need not be decided in order for the conditions\nof such experience to be examined in the science of physics.\n\nRobinson (1994) sets forth the most extensive case for sense data in\nrecent times. His book offers a history of sense-data theory, which he\nsees as deriving from Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. Robinson thus\ndisagrees with the history offered above as regards Berkeley and\nLocke. He also specifies a standard conception of sense data (1994:\n1\u20132): that such data possess the sensible qualiteis they appear\nto have, and that they are not intrinscally representational (they do\nnot intrinsically refer beyond themselves; they have no intentional\ncontent). He takes the Argument from Illusion to be the primary\nclassical argument for sense data in the twentieth century (though not\nmuch invoked before). Most of the other arguments he examines are\nrelated to Variation or Illusion, or to Jackson\u2019s argument from\nscience about color.\n\nSome of Robinson\u2019s arguments are new to our discussion, such as\nthe Time-Lag Argument. It notes that the light reaching our eyes from\nstars may be hundreds or thousands of years old and so the star may\nhave ceased to exist. On the assumption that the object of veridical\nperception exists, our perception cannot be of the actual star, and\nhence must be of another object. But all perception involves a causal\nprocess that unfolds in time; hence, on the assumption that perception\nmust be simultaneous with its object, we never perceive the actual\nproperties of the things that reflect or emit light (1994: ch. 3).\nThis argument can be extended to a Causal Argument (1994: ch. 6) which\nappeals to the fact that we can be made to seem to perceive objects by\nnon-standard causal processes, such as those that underlie\nhallucination. In such cases, we don\u2019t perceive an external\nobject and so there must be another object that we perceive, having\nthe properties that appear to us (invoking\n item 3 of the Classical Notion).\n These cases could be phenomenally indistinguishable from normal\nperception. Hence, arguing that phenomenally indistinguishable items\nshould be classified as the same type of object (as in Price\u2019s\nArgument from Illusion, Sec. 2.2.3, above), we should conclude that in\nthe normal case we also don\u2019t directly perceive an external\nobject.\n\nIn addition to making these various arguments for sense data, Robinson\n(1994: ch. 7) also raises objections against what he takes to be the\nprimary opponents: intentionalism and the adverbial theory. He further\nsuggests that, if his arguments for sense data are sound, this finding\nwould support a phenomenalistic idealism over physical realism (1994:\nchs. 8\u20139). (On idealism, see Guyer & Horstmann 2015 [2021];\non realism, Miller 2002 [2019].)\n\nFor those who would avoid both mental and non-mental perceptual\nintermediaries, the theory of \u201cNaturalized Sense Data\u201d\n(NSD) is of interest (Berm\u00fadez 2000). It distinguishes between\nwhat is directly perceived and what is immediately perceived. In this\nscheme, three-dimensional objects are directly perceived but not\nimmediately perceived. We immediately perceive the portion of the\nsurface of the object that is visible at any moment. Because we\nimmediately perceive a portion of the three-dimensional object, we are\nable to make ostensive reference to the three-dimensional object\nitself and so, it is claimed, to perceive it directly. NSD assumes\nthat na\u00efve realism holds that we immediately perceive\nthree-dimensional objects as a whole; NSD therefore rejects na\u00efve\nrealism, since according to NSD we immediately perceive only\nsurface-portions (2000: 369\u2013372). NSD objects to traditional\nsense-data theory as placing an unnecessary intermediary between the\nperceiver and ostended objects (2000: 370\u2013371).\n\nThere are two problems with this position. First, as Berm\u00fadez\nobserves, if it is to avoid bringing in mentalistic factors, it\nrequires a physicalist account of color as a surface property, which\nhas not been forthcoming (2000: 368, n. 14; 373). Second, if a\nphysical surface-portion provides the immediate object of perception,\nthen it provides the phenomenal content of our perception. When Moore\nendorsed surface-portions as immediate objects, he noted the problem\nthat if a surface of a round penny (seen obliquely) is the object of\nperception, it should appear round. Since he held that it did not, he\nfelt compelled to say that the sense datum appears elliptical but is\nround, thereby sundering the immediacy by bringing a separate\n\u201cappearance\u201d into the mix. A defender of NSD might counter\nMoore\u2019s response by saying that the penny in fact looks round\nand slanted, so there is no disparity between physical surface-portion\nand phenomenal perception. But then Price\u2019s objection arises.\nPrice allowed for what is now called full shape constancy within a few\nfeet of the observer: the round penny at a slant would appear round.\nBut he noted that, beyond a few feet, constancy starts to break\n down.[24]\n This creates a problem for NSD: within the framework set out here, it\nwould need to recognize \u201cappearances\u201d with content that\ndiffers from the actual structure of a surface-portion. This violates\nthe intent of NSD, which is to establish an account in which the\nphenomenal content of perceptual experience is provided by the\nproperties of the surface-portion itself, without needing to invoke\nappearances in addition to immediately perceived surface-portions.\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe core notion of a sense datum is an immediately given, minimal\nperceptual object, consisting in the case of vision of a shaped patch\nof color. Often, but not always, this datum was considered to be two\ndimensional. It typically was contrasted with the perception of a\nthree-dimensional material object of a particular kind and displaying\na panoply of further properties. In the classical period (the first\nseveral decades of the twentieth century), sense data were typically\ntaken to be non-mental and mind-independent, and were often regarded\nas representing material objects. In some cases, sense data or their\nkin were taken to be elemental constituents in the composition or\nbundling of sense particulars. These particulars did not refer to\nmaterial objects per se but, when conjoined, composed a perceptual\nworld (as in Russell 1914a and 1914b). More recently, sense data have\nbeen viewed as mental items (e.g., Jackson 1977), and perhaps as\nleading to idealism (Robinson 1994). In a few cases, sense data have\nbeen equated with portions of the surface of a material object (Moore\n1918\u201319: 23\u201324; Berm\u00fadez 2000).\n\nThe theory of sense data is a species of a genera of positions in\nperception theory, which make a distinction between an impoverished\nsense impression and the perception, affirmation, or judgment of a\nfurther entity, usually a material object. Although sharing this\ndistinction, other species in this genus differ from sense-data theory\nin various ways, the most fundamental being that they do not posit an\nobject having the properties of color and shape as found in conscious\nperception\n (item 3).\n Some views render perceived properties as appearances. One type of\nappearance theory holds that shape, color, and other perceived\nobject-properties are intentional contents (intentionalism). Another\ntype holds that experiences of shapes and colors are manners or modes\nof perceiving (adverbialism). Adherents of both types of theory reject\nthe act-object analysis and so would reject item 8 of the Classical\nNotion; and, of course, they would also reject items 1 and 2. In\nanother vein, some versions of na\u00efve realism hold that we\nimmediately perceive the surface of an object from a point of view and\nin three dimensions, and then augment the basic perception to include\nconceptualized object content (No\u00eb 2004, Brewer 2011). At\npresent, these various positions enjoy more favor than do theories\nthat posit sense data as mental objects or as third things. Indeed,\nrecent discussions in the philosophy of perception frequently use\nsense data as an example of a concept or an entity to be avoided\n(e.g., Fish 2010: ch. 2).\n\nTheories that distinguish impoverished sense perception from object\nperception and cognition have been challenged by what Firth\n(1949\u201350) called the \u201cpercept theory\u201d, according to\nwhich immediate visual experience is of a three-dimensional visual\nworld that manifests object-properties and possibilities for action.\nThis is the tradition of James, the Gestalt psychologists, Gibson, and\nsome of the appearance theories (e.g., Smith 2002). Such theories have\ngrown in favor recently. But sense-data theories have also shown\ndevelopment. Many sense-data theories recognize the immediate objects\nof perception to be three-dimensional. This would permit a penny seen\nat a moderate slant to be described as appearing as a circle at a\nslant, not an ellipse. Finally, although treatment of color as a\nprimitive property that literally inheres in sense data (whether such\ndata are considered to be surface portions, mental objects, or third\nthings) is not widely favored, it is also true that, metaphysically,\nthere is no settled home for phenomenally experienced color. The\nendeavor to account for the phenomenal characteristics of objects and\ntheir properties is ongoing.",
