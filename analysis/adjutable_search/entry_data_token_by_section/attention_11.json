    "main_text": "Theories of Attention || Motor Theories\n2.8 Motor Theories\n\nWork in which electrodes are used in vivo to stimulate areas\nof the macaque brain known to be associated with eye-movement\ncoordination has provided strong evidence for the existence of an\nanatomical overlap between brain areas involved in eye-movement\ncontrol and those involved in determining which stimuli elicit the\nstrongest responses in visual cortex. There is also evidence that this\nanatomical fact has some functional significance. One suggestive\nfinding is that the links between frontal eye-movement-control areas\nand attention-like effects in occipital visual areas are spatially\nspecific: an electrode that is placed so that it elicits an eye\nmovement to a particular part of the visual field when activated at\none level will, if activated at a lower level, elicit changes in\nneural responsiveness that are exactly similar to the changes that are\nseen when attention is shifted to that same location (Moore and\nArmstrong, 2003, Armstrong and Moore, 2007).\n\nThese facts have been taken to be suggestive of a \u2018motor\ntheory\u2019 of attention, according to which the processes\nunderpinning attention are, in at least some cases, truncated versions\nof the processes underpinning the coordination of movements of sensory\norientation.\n\nThe central idea of such a theory is that \u201cthe program for\norienting attention either overtly or covertly is the same, but in the\nlatter case the eyes are blocked at a certain peripheral stage\u201d\n(Rizzolatti et al, 1987, 37). Advocates of motor theories\n(such as Moore, Armstrong and Fallah, 2003) have characterised their\nwork as a revival of the picture that Alexander Bain proposed at the\nend of the nineteenth century. Bain (as we saw in Section\n 1.5,\n above) identified attention with truncated versions of the\nmotor-control processes that typically bring about attention\u2019s\nbehavioural manifestations \u2014 processes \u201cstopping short of\nthe actual movement performed by the organ\u201d (Bain, 1888,\n371).\n\nThese versions of the motor theory should be distinguished from\ntheories that regard attention and motor control as intimately linked,\nbut that place no emphasis on the fact that the motor control\nprocesses that have been implicated in attention are processes that\ncontrol the movement of sensory organs. In these theories\n(which are natural but not obligatory concomitants of the\n\u2018selection-for-action\u2019 views discussed in\n section 2.5)\n attention stands in an intimate relation to motor control more\ngenerally. One line of experimental evidence in support of such a\ngeneral connection comes from work by Heiner Deubel and his\ncollaborators, in which various changes to the way in which an object\nfigures in action are shown to have an attention-indicating influence\non the perceptual discrimination of stimuli that are presented on or\nnear that object. In one striking example of this, Deubel and\nSchneider found that the way in which attention is allocated to the\nspace around a 6.5cm wooden X shape depended on whether the subject\nwas reaching with her left hand to grasp the shape by the top-left and\nbottom right arms, or reaching with her right hand to grasp the shape\nby the arms at its top-right and bottom left (Deubel & Schneider,\n2004). In each case attention was allocated not only to the shape, but\nto the to-be-gripped parts of it. (For other evidence of interactions\nbetween attention and action-targeting, see Tipper, Howard, and\nHoughton, 1998.)\n\nMotor theories and other action-based theories give a plausible\naccount of some of attention\u2019s instances, but they have\nlimitations that prevent them from applying with full generality:\nSince movement of the eyes, or of the limbs, is always movement to\na location motor theories will struggle to account for the\nallocation of attention on the basis of anything other than location.\nThey therefore face the limitations that we saw when considering pure\nspotlight theories, of being unable to account for shifts in attention\nthat do not correspond to differences in the location attended. Nor is\nit clear how motor theories should be applied to spatial attention in\nthose sensory modalities where the orientation of the sense organs is\nless straightforward than it is in the visual case. The motor theory\ndoes, nonetheless, provide a plausible and well-supported account of\nthe location-based variety of visual attention that is displayed in\ntypical attention-lab experiments.\n\nThe success of motor theories in accounting for the sorts of attention\nthat are found in some typical attention-lab experiments can be given\neither an optimistic or a pessimistic interpretation. The optimistic\ninterpretation sees the motor theory as providing a successful account\nof the processing underpinning some of attention\u2019s simpler and\nmore central varieties. The pessimistic interpretation sees the motor\ntheory as revealing a problem with our usual experimental\nparadigms.\u00a0 The participants in typical laboratory tasks direct\ntheir attention to different parts of their visual field, while\nkeeping their eyes fixated on a central spot. The behavioural\nsignatures of attention in such tasks are usually reductions in\nreaction time to the attended stimuli. The neural correlates of these\nbehavioural signatures are certain biases as to which stimuli most\nstrongly drive the neural circuitry that processes them. The central\nfinding of the motor-theorists is that these neural and behavioural\neffects can result from attenuated versions of the activity\nresponsible for directing eye movements. The pessimistic\ninterpretation of this finding is as revealing that signs that have\ntraditionally been taken to indicate the direction of attention are\nactually no more than consequences of the truncated eye-movements that\nour experimental paradigms induce, by imposing the restriction that\nexperimental participants fixate their gaze on a single location. If\nthat is right then the phenomenon studied in attention labs may not be\nthe psychologically important one that it has been taken for.\n\nMotor theorists are not the only ones who might be accused of\nelevating a theory of some circumscribed subset of attention-related\nphenomena into a spuriously general theory of attention in its\nentirety. Henry Taylor has shown that, although the ambition to give a\ngeneral theory of attention is widespread among the philosophers who\nhave recently written on this subject, it is seldom found in the\nrecent psychological literature, where it has proven fruitful to\nfollow the influential example of Michael Posner by giving somewhat\nseparate treatments of attention\u2019s roles in vigilance, in\nperceptual orientation, and in the focalized deployment of processing\nresources (Taylor, 2015, 2018; Posner and Boies, 1971). Taylor\nsuggests that the psychologists\u2019 tolerance for pluralism here\nshould be reflected in our philosophical theories.\n",
