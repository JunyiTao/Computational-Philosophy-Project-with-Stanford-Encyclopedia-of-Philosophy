    "main_text": "History of Derivations of Mass-Energy Equivalence || Derivations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\) that Use Maxwell\u2019s Theory\n3.1 Derivations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\) that Use Maxwell\u2019s Theory\n\nEinstein\u2019s original derivation of mass-energy equivalence is the\nbest known in this group. Einstein begins with the following\nthought-experiment: a body at rest (in some inertial frame) emits two\npulses of light of equal energy in opposite directions. Einstein then\nanalyzes this \u201cact of emission\u201d from another inertial\nframe, which is in a state of uniform motion relative to the first. In\nthis analysis, Einstein uses Maxwell\u2019s theory of\nelectromagnetism to calculate the physical properties of the light\npulses (such as their intensity) in the second inertial frame. By\ncomparing the two descriptions of the \u201cact of emission\u201d,\nEinstein arrives at his celebrated result: \u201cthe mass of a body\nis a measure of its energy-content; if the energy changes by \\(L\\),\nthe mass changes in the same sense by \\(L/9 \\times 10^{20}\\), the\nenergy being measured in ergs, and the mass in grammes\u201d (1905b,\np.\u00a071). A similar derivation using the same thought experiment\nbut appealing to the Doppler effect was given by Langevin (1913) (see\nthe discussion of the inertia of energy in Fox (1965, p.\u00a08)).\n\n\nSome philosophers and historians of science claim that\nEinstein\u2019s first derivation is fallacious. For example, in\nThe Concept of Mass, Jammer says: \u201cIt is a curious\nincident in the history of scientific thought that Einstein\u2019s\nown derivation of the formula \\(E = mc^2\\), as published in his\narticle in Annalen der Physik, was basically fallacious. . .\n\u00a0 the result of a petitio principii, the conclusion\nbegging the question\u201d (Jammer, 1961, p.\u00a0177). According to\nJammer, Einstein implicitly assumes what he is trying to prove, viz.,\nthat if a body emits an amount of energy \\(L\\), its inertial mass will\ndecrease by an amount \\(\\Delta m = L/c^2\\). Jammer also accuses\nEinstein of assuming the expression for the relativistic kinetic\nenergy of a body. If Einstein made these assumptions, he would be\nguilty of begging the question. However, Stachel and Torretti (1982)\nhave shown convincingly that Einstein\u2019s (1905b) argument is\nsound. They note that Einstein indeed derives the expression for the\nkinetic energy of an \u201celectron\u201d (i.e., a structureless\nparticle with a net charge) in his earlier (1905a) paper. However,\nEinstein nowhere uses this expression in the (1905b) derivation of\nmass-energy equivalence. Stachel and Torretti also show that\nEinstein\u2019s critics overlook two key moves that are sufficient to\nmake Einstein\u2019s derivation sound, since one need not assume that\n\\(\\Delta m = L/c^2\\).\n\nEinstein\u2019s further conclusion that \u201cthe mass of a body is\na measure of its energy content\u201d (1905b, p.\u00a071) does not,\nstrictly speaking, follow from his argument. As Torretti (1996) and\nother philosophers and physicists have observed, Einstein\u2019s\n(1905b) argument allows for the possibility that once a body\u2019s\nenergy store has been entirely used up (and subtracted from the mass\nusing the mass-energy equivalence relation) the remainder is not zero.\nIn other words, it is only an hypothesis in Einstein\u2019s (1905b)\nargument, and indeed in all derivations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\) in special\nrelativity, that no \u201cexotic matter\u201d exists that is\nnot convertible into energy (see Ehlers, Rindler, Penrose,\n(1965) for a discussion of this point). However, particle-antiparticle\nanihilation experiments in atomic physics, which were first observed\ndecades after 1905, strongly support \u201cEinstein\u2019s dauntless\nextrapolation\u201d (Torretti, 1996, p. 112).\n\nIn general, derivations in this group use the same style of reasoning.\nOne typically begins by considering an object that either absorbs or\nemits electromagnetic radiation (typically light) of total energy\n\\(E_o\\) in equal and opposite directions. Because light carries both\nenergy and momentum, one then uses the conservation principles for\nthose quantities and the standard heuristic in relativity of\nconsidering the same physical process from two different inertial\nframes that are in a state of relative motion to show that in order\nfor the conservation principles to be satisfied, the mass (i.e.,\nrest-mass) of the emitting or absorbing object must increase or\ndecrease by an amount \\(E_o /c^2\\). For a more detailed description of\na simplified derivation in this group, see\n Section 1.5\n\n\nOne of the few exceptions to this approach among derivations that use\nMaxwell\u2019s theory is Einstein\u2019s 1906 derivation (Einstein\n1906). In this derivation, Einstein considers a freely-floating box. A\nburst of electromagnetic radiation of energy \\(E_o\\) is emitted inside\nthe box from one wall toward a parallel wall. Einstein shows that the\nprinciple of mechanics that says that the motion of the center of mass\nof a body cannot change merely because of changes inside the body\nwould be violated if one did not attribute an inertial mass \\(E_o\n/c^2\\) to the burst of electromagnetic radiation (see Taylor and\nWheeler 1992, p. 254 for a detailed discussion of this example). \n",
