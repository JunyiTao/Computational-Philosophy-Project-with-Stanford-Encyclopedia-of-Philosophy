    "main_text": "Bohr || From wave-particle duality to complementarity\n3.1 From wave-particle duality to complementarity\n\nLong before the development of modern quantum mechanics, Bohr had been\nparticularly concerned with the problem of particle-wave duality,\ni.e., the problem that experimental evidence on the behaviour of both\nlight and matter seemed to demand a wave picture in some cases, and a\nparticle picture in others. Yet these pictures are mutually exclusive.\nWhereas a particle is always localized, the very definition of the\nnotions of wavelength and frequency requires an extension in space and\nin time. Moreover, the classical particle picture is incompatible with\nthe characteristic phenomenon of interference.\n\nHis long struggle with wave-particle duality had prepared him for a\nradical step when the dispute between matrix and wave mechanics broke\nout in 1926\u201327. For the main contestants, Heisenberg and\nSchr\u00f6dinger, the issue at stake was which view could claim to\nprovide a single coherent and universal framework for the description\nof the observational data. The choice was, essentially between a\ndescription in terms of continuously evolving waves, or else one of\nparticles undergoing discontinuous quantum jumps. By contrast, Bohr\ninsisted that elements from both views were equally valid and equally\nneeded for an exhaustive description of the data. His way out of the\ncontradiction was to renounce the idea that the pictures refer, in a\nliteral one-to-one correspondence, to physical reality. Instead, the\napplicability of these pictures was to become dependent on the\nexperimental context. This is the gist of the viewpoint he called\n\u201ccomplementarity\u201d.\n\nBohr first conceived the general outline of his complementarity\nargument in early 1927, during a skiing holiday in Norway, at the same\ntime when Heisenberg wrote his uncertainty paper. When he returned to\nCopenhagen and found Heisenberg\u2019s manuscript, they got into an\nintense discussion. On the one hand, Bohr was quite enthusiastic about\nHeisenberg\u2019s ideas which seemed to fit wonderfully with his own\nthinking. Indeed, in his subsequent work, Bohr always presented the\nuncertainty relations as the symbolic expression of his\ncomplementarity viewpoint. On the other hand, he criticized Heisenberg\nseverely for his suggestion that these relations were due to\ndiscontinuous changes occurring during a measurement process. Rather,\nBohr argued, their proper derivation should start from the\nindispensability of both particle and wave concepts. He pointed out\nthat the uncertainties in the experiment did not exclusively arise\nfrom the discontinuities but also from the fact that in the experiment\nwe need to take into account both the particle theory and the wave\ntheory. It is not so much the unknown disturbance which renders the\nmomentum of the electron uncertain but rather the fact that the\nposition and the momentum of the electron cannot be simultaneously\ndefined in this experiment (see the \u201cAddition in Proof\u201d to\nHeisenberg\u2019s paper).\n\nWe shall not go too deeply into the matter of Bohr\u2019s\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics since we are mostly interested in\nBohr\u2019s view on the uncertainty principle. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of the former we refer to Scheibe (1973), Folse (1985),\nHonner (1987) and Murdoch (1987). It may be useful, however, to sketch\nsome of the main points.  Central in Bohr\u2019s considerations is\nthe language we use in physics. No matter how abstract and\nsubtle the concepts of modern physics may be, they are essentially an\nextension of our ordinary language and a means to communicate the\nresults of our experiments.  These results, obtained under\nwell-defined experimental circumstances, are what Bohr calls the\n\u201cphenomena\u201d. A phenomenon is \u201cthe comprehension of\nthe effects observed under given experimental conditions\u201d (Bohr\n1939: 24), it is the resultant of a physical object, a measuring\napparatus and the interaction between them in a concrete experimental\nsituation. The essential difference between classical and quantum\nphysics is that in quantum physics the interaction between the object\nand the apparatus cannot be made arbitrarily small; the interaction\nmust at least comprise one quantum.  This is expressed by Bohr\u2019s\nquantum postulate:\n\n\n[\u2026 the] essence [of the formulation of the quantum theory] may\nbe expressed in the so-called quantum postulate, which attributes to\nany atomic process an essential discontinuity or rather individuality,\ncompletely foreign to classical theories and symbolized by\nPlanck\u2019s quantum of action. (Bohr 1928: 580)\n\n\nA phenomenon, therefore, is an indivisible whole and the result of a\nmeasurement cannot be considered as an autonomous manifestation of the\nobject itself independently of the measurement context. The quantum\npostulate forces upon us a new way of describing physical\nphenomena:\n\n\nIn this situation, we are faced with the necessity of a radical\nrevision of the foundation for the description and explanation of\nphysical phenomena. Here, it must above all be recognized that,\nhowever far quantum effects transcend the scope of classical physical\nanalysis, the account of the experimental arrangement and the record\nof the observations must always be expressed in common language\nsupplemented with the terminology of classical physics. (Bohr 1948:\n313)\n\n\nThis is what Scheibe (1973) has called the \u201cbuffer\npostulate\u201d because it prevents the quantum from penetrating into\nthe classical description: A phenomenon must always be described in\nclassical terms; Planck\u2019s constant does not occur in this\ndescription.\n\nTogether, the two postulates induce the following reasoning. In every\nphenomenon the interaction between the object and the apparatus\ncomprises at least one quantum. But the description of the phenomenon\nmust use classical notions in which the quantum of action does not\noccur. Hence, the interaction cannot be analysed in this description.\nOn the other hand, the classical character of the description allows\nus to speak in terms of the object itself. Instead of saying:\n\u201cthe interaction between a particle and a photographic plate has\nresulted in a black spot in a certain place on the plate\u201d, we\nare allowed to forgo mentioning the apparatus and say: \u201cthe\nparticle has been found in this place\u201d. The experimental\ncontext, rather than changing or disturbing pre-existing properties of\nthe object, defines what can meaningfully be said about the\nobject.\n\nBecause the interaction between object and apparatus is left out in\nour description of the phenomenon, we do not get the whole picture.\nYet, any attempt to extend our description by performing the\nmeasurement of a different observable quantity of the object, or\nindeed, on the measurement apparatus, produces a new phenomenon and we\nare again confronted with the same situation. Because of the\nunanalyzable interaction in both measurements, the two descriptions\ncannot, generally, be united into a single picture. They are what Bohr\ncalls complementary descriptions:\n\n\n[the quantum of action]\u2026forces us to adopt a new mode of\ndescription designated as complementary in the sense that any given\napplication of classical concepts precludes the simultaneous use of\nother classical concepts which in a different connection are equally\nnecessary for the elucidation of the phenomena. (Bohr 1929: 10)\n\n\nThe most important example of complementary descriptions is provided\nby the measurements of the position and momentum of an object. If one\nwants to measure the position of the object relative to a given\nspatial frame of reference, the measuring instrument must be rigidly\nfixed to the bodies which define the frame of reference. But this\nimplies the impossibility of investigating the exchange of momentum\nbetween the object and the instrument and we are cut off from\nobtaining any information about the momentum of the object. If, on the\nother hand, one wants to measure the momentum of an object the\nmeasuring instrument must be able to move relative to the spatial\nreference frame. Bohr here assumes that a momentum measurement\ninvolves the registration of the recoil of some movable part of the\ninstrument and the use of the law of momentum conservation. The\nlooseness of the part of the instrument with which the object\ninteracts entails that the instrument cannot serve to accurately\ndetermine the position of the object. Since a measuring instrument\ncannot be rigidly fixed to the spatial reference frame and, at the\nsame time, be movable relative to it, the experiments which serve to\nprecisely determine the position and the momentum of an object are\nmutually exclusive. Of course, in itself, this is not at all typical\nfor quantum mechanics. But, because the interaction between object and\ninstrument during the measurement can neither be neglected nor\ndetermined the two measurements cannot be combined. This means that in\nthe description of the object one must choose between the assignment\nof a precise position or of a precise momentum.\n\nSimilar considerations hold with respect to the measurement of time\nand energy. Just as the spatial coordinate system must be fixed by\nmeans of solid bodies so must the time coordinate be fixed by means of\nunperturbed, synchronised clocks. But it is precisely this requirement\nwhich prevents one from taking into account of the exchange of energy\nwith the instrument if this is to serve its purpose. Conversely, any\nconclusion about the object based on the conservation of energy\nprevents following its development in time.\n\nThe conclusion is that in quantum mechanics we are confronted with a\ncomplementarity between two descriptions which are united in the\nclassical mode of description: the space-time description (or\ncoordination) of a process and the description based on the\napplicability of the dynamical conservation laws. The quantum forces\nus to give up the classical mode of description (also called the\n\u201ccausal\u201d mode of description by\n Bohr[4]:\n it is impossible to form a classical picture of what is going on when\nradiation interacts with matter as, e.g., in the Compton effect.\n\n\nAny arrangement suited to study the exchange of energy and momentum\nbetween the electron and the photon must involve a latitude in the\nspace-time description sufficient for the definition of wave-number\nand frequency which enter in the relation [\\(E = h\\nu\\) and \\(p =\nh\\sigma\\)]. Conversely, any attempt of locating the collision between\nthe photon and the electron more accurately would, on account of the\nunavoidable interaction with the fixed scales and clocks defining the\nspace-time reference frame, exclude all closer account as regards the\nbalance of momentum and energy. (Bohr 1949: 210)\n\n\nA causal description of the process cannot be attained; we have to\ncontent ourselves with complementary descriptions. \u201cThe\nviewpoint of complementarity may be regarded\u201d, according to\nBohr, \u201cas a rational generalization of the very ideal of\ncausality\u201d.\n\nIn addition to complementary descriptions Bohr also talks about\ncomplementary phenomena and complementary quantities. Position and\nmomentum, as well as time and energy, are complementary\n quantities.[5]\n\n\nWe have seen that Bohr\u2019s approach to quantum theory puts heavy\nemphasis on the language used to communicate experimental\nobservations, which, in his opinion, must always remain classical. By\ncomparison, he seemed to put little value on arguments starting from\nthe mathematical formalism of quantum theory. This informal approach\nis typical of all of Bohr\u2019s discussions on the meaning of\nquantum mechanics. One might say that for Bohr the conceptual\nclarification of the situation has primary importance while the\nformalism is only a symbolic representation of this situation.\n\nThis is remarkable since, finally, it is the formalism which needs to\nbe interpreted. This neglect of the formalism is one of the reasons\nwhy it is so difficult to get a clear understanding of Bohr\u2019s\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics and why it has aroused so much\ncontroversy. We close this section by citing from an article of 1948\nto show how Bohr conceived the role of the formalism of quantum\nmechanics:\n\n\nThe entire formalism is to be considered as a tool for deriving\npredictions, of definite or statistical character, as regards\ninformation obtainable under experimental conditions described in\nclassical terms and specified by means of parameters entering into the\nalgebraic or differential equations of which the matrices or the\nwave-functions, respectively, are solutions. These symbols themselves,\nas is indicated already by the use of imaginary numbers, are not\nsusceptible to pictorial interpretation; and even derived real\nfunctions like densities and currents are only to be regarded as\nexpressing the probabilities for the occurrence of individual events\nobservable under well-defined experimental conditions.
