    "main_text": "The differential geometry of Riemann\n6. Lie Groups\n\n\nFor a philosopher, the most satisfying feature of the tremendous\ncomplication attained by 19th-century mathematics was perhaps the\npromptness with which the newly created (or discovered?) mathematical\nstructures found their way into empirical science, enabling the\nintellectual grasp and handling of actual phenomena. We shall wind up\nthis survey of 19th-century geometry with a few light remarks on a\nparticularly rich and fruitful structure that has pride of place in\ncurrent physics, namely, Lie groups, so called after Sophus Lie\n(1842\u20131899), the Norwegian mathematician who studied them in\ndepth after 1870. A Lie group is, of course, a group in the algebraic\nsense we met in \u00a73, that is, a set G such that (i) every\nordered pair <x,y> \u2208 G is associated\nto a unique element x \u00b7 y\n\u2208 G (known as the product or the sum\nof x and y); (ii) the product operation is associative,\ni.e., (x \u00b7 y)\n\u00b7 z = x \u00b7\n(y \u00b7 z), for\nevery x, y, z \u2208 G; (iii) there is a\none and only one element 0 \u2208 G such that for\nevery x \u2208 G, x \u00b7\n0 = 0 \u00b7 x = x (0\nis the identity or neutral element of G); (iv)\nfor every x \u2208 G, there is one and only one\nelement x\u22121 \u2208 G such\nthat x\n\u00b7 x\u22121 = 0\n(x\u22121 is known as the inverse\nof x). But a Lie group is also a smooth manifold, as described\nin the supplement\n A Modern Formulation of Riemann's Theory: \n the set G can be\nrepresented patchwise by systems of real-valued (or alternatively\ncomplex-valued) coordinates, mutually linked by well-defined,\ndifferentiable coordinate transformations wherever their respective\npatches overlap. The group and manifold structures of G are meshed\ntogether by the condition that the product operation is a\ndifferentiable mapping of G \u00d7 G into G.\n\n\nA simple, yet important, example of a Lie group is the group SO(2),\ninstantiated by the rotations of the plane about an arbitrary fixed\npoint. The manifold is topologically compact and therefore cannot be\ncovered by a single coordinate patch, but three will suffice: one\nincluding, say, all counterclockwise rotations by more than three\nradians and less than four, which can be naturally coordinatized using\nthe real numbers in the open interval (3,4); another patch comprising\nthe inverses of the former, which can be mapped onto the open interval\n(\u22124,\u22123), and a third one covering all counterclockwise\nrotations by less than two right angles plus their clockwise inverses,\nwhich can be mapped onto the open interval\n(\u2212\u03c0,\u03c0). Indeed, all the groups we encountered in\n\u00a73, which Klein used for characterizing the Euclidean geometry of\nspace and the classical Non-Euclidean geometries, are Lie groups, and\ntheir respective smooth manifold structures allow for topological\nquirks. Thus the Euclidean isometries constitute a disconnected\nmanifold, with mirror reflection not included in the same component as\nthe subgroup of Euclidean motions. \n\n\nLike all smooth manifolds, a Lie group G has a tangent vector\nspace attached to each element. In particular, the tangent space at\nthe neutral element 0 of G becomes the Lie algebra\nof G by the definition of the so-called Lie bracket, a\nbilinear mapping of T0G\n\u00d7 T0G\ninto T0G, which, for\nall u,v,w in T0G\nsatisfies the condition [u,u] = 0 and the Jacobi\nidentity: [u,[v,w]] +\n[v,[w,u]] + [w,[u,v]] =\n0. The Lie algebra of G throws much light on the structure\nof G through the homeomorphic (\u201cexponential\u201d) mapping of a\nneighborhood of 0 \u2208 T0G into a\nneighborhood of 0 \u2208 G. \n\nIn the supplement\n A Modern Formulation of Riemann's Theory\n we touch on the idea of a fiber bundle, formed by two smooth\nmanifolds F and M, bound together by a \u201cprojection\u201d\nmapping \u03c0 of F onto M, which partitions the\nmanifold F into \u201cfibers\u201d, mapped by \u03c0 to the different\npoints of M. A fiber bundle <F,M,\u03c0>\nbecomes a principal fiber bundle\n<F,M,\u03c0,G> if a Lie group G,\nknown as the bundle's structure group, acts on F in such\na way that each fiber of F is an orbit of the action and a few\nother conditions are met. For instance, the Lorentz group is the\nstructure group of the principal fiber bundle of tetrads (orthonormal\n4-tuples of tangent vectors at each point) on any relativistic\nspacetime, no matter how bizarre. In such ways, Lie groups provide a\nmeans of unifying the many models allowed by a physical theory and of\nintroducing some degree of homogeneity among them. \n\nDuring the last third of the 20th-century, fibre bundles and their Lie\ngroups have virtually taken over fundamental physics. This is not the\nplace to explain how or why, but the unstoppable evolution of physics\ntowards ever more mathematically sophisticated, prima facie\nless straightforward representations of its subject-matter, deserves\nthe attention of philosophers. It is clear that the concept of a\ndefinite stable thing out there, which might, at least in principle,\nbe held and manipulated, is no longer so serviceable to us as it was\nonce to our flint-carving ancestors. \n",
