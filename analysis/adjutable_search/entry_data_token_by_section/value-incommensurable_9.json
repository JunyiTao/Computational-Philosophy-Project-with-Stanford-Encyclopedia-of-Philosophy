    "main_text": "Arguments for Value Incommensurability and Incomparability || Moral Dilemmas\n3.2 Moral Dilemmas\n\nBoth value incommensurability and incomparability have been invoked to\nmake sense of a central feature of supposed moral\ndilemmas\u2014namely, that no matter which alternative the agent\nchooses, she fails to do something she ought to do. The apparent value\nconflicts involved in these choices have led some philosophers to\nrelate moral dilemmas to the incomparability or incommensurability of\nvalues. Henry Richardson, for example, takes the situation confronting\nSophie in the novel Sophie\u2019s Choice\u2014that one of\nher two children will be spared death, but only if she chooses which\none to save\u2014to point to the incommensurability of values (1994,\n115\u2013117).\n\nIt has been argued that the mere fact of a moral dilemma does not\nimply incomparability. James Griffin, for example, argues that the\nfeature of \u201cirreplaceability\u201d in moral dilemmas often may\nbe mistaken as evidence for incomparability (1997, 37).\nIrreplaceability is the feature that what is lost in choosing one\nalternative over another cannot be replaced by what is gained in\nchoosing another alternative. Although a conflict of values displays\nthis feature, not all instances of irreplaceability need involve\nplural values. Some moral dilemmas, for example, may involve not a\nconflict of values, but a conflict of obligations that arises from the\nsame consideration. Consider forced choices in saving lives. If there\nis a dilemma, it need not involve conflicting values, but rather\nconflicting obligations that arise from the same consideration. Walter\nSinnott-Armstrong calls such dilemmas \u201csymmetrical\u201d (1988,\n54\u201358). The dilemma encountering Sophie, it may be said, does not\npoint to the incommensurability of values.\n\nRichardson acknowledges that the moral considerations underlying\nSophie\u2019s dilemma are not incommensurable. Nonetheless, he takes\nvalue incommensurability to be essential to understanding the tragedy\nof the dilemma that Sophie encounters. \u201cIt is a distinguishing\nfeature of love, including parental love,\u201d he writes,\n\u201cthat it cherishes the particular and unique features of the\nbeloved\u201d (115). He concludes, \u201cthe fact that she cannot\nadequately represent each child\u2019s value on a single scale is\nwhat makes the choosing tragic\u201d (116). By locating the\nincommensurability of values at the level of what is valuable about\neach of her children, Richardson argues that the tragedy of the\ndilemma points to incomparability.\n\nAnother common approach to argue for value incommensurability is with\nreference to \u201cnon-symmetrical\u201d dilemmas. As the name\nsuggests, in non-symmetrical dilemmas, the alternatives are favored by\ndifferent values (Sinnott-Armstrong 1988). If these values are\nincommensurable in the third sense as discussed in subsection 1.3,\nthere is no systematic resolution of the value conflict. Consider\nJean-Paul Sartre\u2019s well-known example of his pupil who faced the\nchoice between going to England to join the Free French Forces and\nstaying at home to help his mother live (Sartre 1975, 295\u2013296). No\nmatter which alternative he chooses, certain values will remain\nunrealized. An idea along these lines is considered, for example, by\nWalter Sinnott-Armstrong (1988, 69\u201371) and Bernard Williams (1981,\n74\u201378) in their discussions of moral dilemmas.\n",
