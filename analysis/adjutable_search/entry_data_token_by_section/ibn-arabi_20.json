    "main_text": "Human Perfection || Perfect Man\n6.2 Perfect Man\n\nAs the model of human possibility, Perfect Man represents the\nindividual who has traversed the circle of existence, reached the\nstation of Two-Bows\u2019 Length, and returned to his origin, the\nReality of Realities. Standing in the Station of No Station, he is\nHe/not He, Eternal/newly arrived, Infinite/finite. He alone functions\nas God\u2019s \u201cvicegerent\u201d (khal\u00eefa) or\nrepresentative, the intermediary between God and creation, which is\nprecisely the role for which Adam was created (Koran 2:30).\nQ\u00fbnaw\u00ee writes:\n\nThe true Perfect Man is the barzakh between Necessity and\npossibility, the mirror that brings together in its essence and level\nthe attributes and properties of Eternity and new arrival\u2026 . He\nis the intermediary between the Real and creation\u2026 . Were it\nnot for him and the fact that he acts as a barzakh no\ndifferent from the two sides, nothing of the cosmos would receive the\ndivine, unitary effusion, because of the lack of correspondence and\ninterrelationship. (Q\u00fbnaw\u00ee, al-Fuk\u00fbk, 248)\n\n\nTo put this in another way, Perfect Man is the spirit that animates\nthe cosmos. This is the theme that begins the first chapter of Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s Ringstones, which explains the\nmanner in which Adam\u2014the human being\u2014manifests the wisdom\nof the all-comprehensive name. In a parallel way, he writes in the\nOpenings:\n\nThe whole cosmos is the differentiation of Adam, and Adam is the\nAll-Comprehensive Book. In relation to the cosmos he is like the\nspirit in relation to the body. Hence man is the spirit of the cosmos,\nand the cosmos is the body. By bringing all this together, the cosmos\nis the great man, so long as man is within it. But, if you look at the\ncosmos alone, without man, you will find it to be like a proportioned\nbody without a spirit. (Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee,\nal-Fut\u00fbh\u00e2t, 1911 edition, 2:67.28)\n\n",
