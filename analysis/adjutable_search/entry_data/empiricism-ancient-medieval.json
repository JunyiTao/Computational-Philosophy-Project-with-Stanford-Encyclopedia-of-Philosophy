    "preamble": "\n\nAlthough empiricism is often thought to be a modern doctrine, it has\nancient roots, and its modern forms derive from late medieval\ndevelopments. This article will begin by outlining three different\nforms of empiricism. It will examine the Presocratic and Hippocratic\norigins of the empiricist attitude, and discuss its development in the\nwork of Aristotle, the Hellenistic medical writers, Epicureans,\nStoics, and Sceptics. It will then examine the combination of\nAristotelian and Augustinian views in the work of thirteenth and\nfourteenth-century philosophers and theologians, the association\nbetween the study of magic and empiricism, the eclipse of the doctrine\nof divine illumination, and the gradual downplaying of the role of the\nintellect in the acquisition of knowledge.\n\nWhy study these ancient and medieval thinkers? To those who believe\nthat \u201cno conception can be properly understood except through\nits history\u201d (Comte 1934: 2), the answer will seem obvious. But\neven those who prefer to engage more directly in philosophical\nanalysis may find these thinkers illuminating. Empiricists have always\nhad difficulty offering an account of key aspects of both everyday and\nscientific knowledge. They have found it hard to explain how we could\nknow about logical and mathematical truths, causal relations, and\n(more generally) the modal structure of the world (how things could\nbe). Since we are still faced with these questions, we may be able to\nlearn from the answers our predecessors gave.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nThere are three questions raised by the title of this entry. The first\nis whether it is anachronistic. Is empiricism not a modern view? Can\nwe attribute it to ancient and medieval thinkers? The charge of\nanachronism might, perhaps, be warranted if empiricism referred to a\nsingle set of beliefs. As we shall see, however, the term covers a\nvariety of views regarding knowledge\n (sect. 2).\n Even among modern thinkers, the empiricism of John Locke\n(1632\u20131704) is not identical with that of Francis Bacon\n(1561\u20131626), and neither bears much resemblance to the\nempiricism of Rudolf Carnap (1891\u20131970), A. J. Ayer\n(1910\u20131989), or Hans Reichenbach (1891\u20131953). Yet all\nthese thinkers have an attitude in common: they adopt a certain\n\u201cstance\u201d towards knowledge (van Fraassen 2002:\n47\u201348). They all desire to keep factual claims (in the sense of\nclaims regarding contingent matters) closely related to the\ndeliverances of the senses. That attitude has ancient roots. Modern\nempiricism was not a creatio e nihilo. It revived views\nalready found in the ancient world, particularly among Hellenistic\nphilosophers (Scott 1995: 238), and the particular questions it was\nseeking to answer arose from late medieval developments.\n\nA second question has to do with the article\u2019s association of\nancient and medieval views. The philosophers discussed here are\nseparated by a thousand years. Why bring them together? This question\nis more easily answered. The intellectual renaissance of the twelfth\nand thirteenth centuries involved a revival of the work of the\nancients. In the field of philosophy this took the form of a\nrediscovery of the works of Aristotle (384\u2013322 BCE), by way of\nLatin translations from Arabic sources and Greek texts from the\nByzantine world. Indeed much of the philosophical writing of this\nperiod was done by way of commentaries on Aristotle. Medieval\nphilosophers were also influenced by writers from a later age, such as\nPlotinus (205\u2013270 CE), Dionysius the Areopagite (5th\u20136th\ncentury CE), and St Augustine (354\u2013430 CE). But since these\nwriters were themselves influenced by Aristotle\u2019s predecessor,\nPlato (427\u2013347 BCE), this aspect of medieval philosophy also has\nancient roots.\n\nA third question has to do with the scope of the discussion. The\ntradition of philosophy being discussed here is that which began in\nthe Greek city states of the sixth and fifth centuries BCE. But\nempiricist views are also found outside of what is (somewhat\nmisleadingly) called the \u2018Western\u2019 philosophical\ntradition. The closest parallels are to be found among the\nLok\u0101yata (C\u0101rv\u0101ka), one of the n\u0101stika\n(non-orthodox) schools of Indian philosophy that existed in the sixth\nand seventh centuries CE. These thinkers are reported to have held\nthat sensory perception is the only reliable means of knowledge and to\nhave rejected the validity of inferences to unobservable entities\n(Chatterjee & Datta 2004: 54\u201359). The Buddha (ca.\n485\u2013405 BCE) could be said to be an empiricist, insofar as he\nbased his dharma (teaching) on experience rather than\nauthority or reason. But the Buddhist idea of experience is broader\nthan that held by most empiricists (Jayatilleke 1963: 463\u201364\n[para. 793]). The twelve \u0101yatanas (sensory domains) of\nBuddhist tradition include the mind as well as the bodily senses and\nmeditation is thought capable of producing higher forms of knowledge\n(the abhij\u00f1\u0101s) that are independent of sensory\nperception. Finally, we can find discussions of sense perception\nwithin classical Chinese philosophy. Mozi (Mo Tzu, ca. 480\u2013392\nBCE), for instance, ranked everyday experience among the three\ncriteria of reliable knowledge (Mozi 35.3), while the more sceptical\nXunzi (Hs\u00fcn Tzu, ca. 312\u2013210 BCE) pointed out how easily\nthe senses are deceived (Xunzi 21.8). But while it would be\ninteresting to explore these traditions, empiricism does not play as\ncentral a role in any of them as it does in the history of Western\nphilosophy.\n\nThe question of scope also arises when it comes to the subject matter\nof the article, which is empiricism as a doctrine rather than as a\npractice. From the very beginning of what the Greeks called \u201cthe\ninvestigation of nature\u201d (h\u0113 peri phuse\u014ds\nhistoria), there have been those who studied the natural world by\nmeans of careful observation. There were medical writers who observed\nand recorded symptoms, astronomers who observed the movements of the\nheavens, and students of music who placed their ears \u201cclose [to\ntheir instruments] as though trying to hear what their neighbours were\nsaying\u201d (Plato Rep. 531a6\u20137). These people\nbelieved it was important to learn from experience (empeiria,\nin Aristotle\u2019s Greek). But they did not formulate a theory about\nlearning from experience. It is the theory of learning from experience\nthat will be the focus of the present study.\n2. Varieties of Empiricism\n\n\u201cNames of philosophical positions,\u201d wrote W. V. O. Quine,\n\u201care a necessary evil\u201d (1995: 251). This is certainly the\ncase with the term \u201cempiricism\u201d: while it is difficult\nsimply to abandon it, it can be misleading. Among historians of early\nmodern philosophy, for instance, the traditional distinction between\nempiricists and rationalists has fallen out of favour, on the grounds\nthat there are few thinkers who can be clearly assigned to either\ncategory (Norton 1981; Loeb 1981: 25\u201375). The problem here,\nhowever, is not the category of empiricism, but its use as a\n\u201cpigeon-hole\u201d into which one tries to place individual\nthinkers. Empiricism need not be a global doctrine: a thinker may be\nan empiricist in one domain but not in another. It is possible, for\ninstance, to be an empiricist about knowledge of the natural world,\nbut a rationalist with regard to a particular area of mathematics\n(Markie 2015: sect. 1.2). So it is not surprising that individual\nthinkers are hard to categorize. But empiricism is also an umbrella\nterm: it covers a variety of views regarding knowledge. Even with\nregard to the one domain, a thinker may be an empiricist in one sense,\nbut not in another. So if we are to use the term, we need to\ndistinguish the different forms empiricism can take.\n2.1 Explanatory Empiricism\n\nThe first is what I shall call explanatory empiricism, which\ndenies the validity of inferences from observable phenomena to causes\nthat cannot themselves be observed. Perhaps the best known modern\nexample is the empiricism of the physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach\n(1838\u20131916). At least for most of his life, Mach rejected the\ntheory of atoms as an example of \u201chypothetico-fictive\nphysics\u201d (Mach 1992: 136) and would respond to believers in\natoms with the words, Habn S\u2019eins gsehn? (Have you seen\none?) (Meyer 1992: 151). (For a slightly different view of\nMach\u2019s atomism, see Banks 2003: 12\u201314.) A more recent\nexample is the \u201cconstructive empiricism\u201d of Bas van\nFraassen, which holds that the aim of science is to produce theories\nthat are empirically adequate, a theory being empirically adequate if\n\u201cwhat it says about the observable things and events in this\nworld, is true\u201d (van Fraassen 1980: 12). This view also rules\nout inferences to unobservable entities (van Fraassen 1980: 72). While\nthis may sound like a modern position, it was held by the first people\nto call themselves \u201cempiricists,\u201d namely a group of\nancient medical writers, who rejected inferences to what is \u201cnot\nevident\u201d in favour of the recording of correlations between\ntypes of observable events\n (sect. 3.3.1).\n2.2 Genetic Empiricism\n\nA second form of empiricism is summed up by the Latin slogan nihil\nest in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in sensu (nothing is in\nthe intellect which has not first been in the senses). We can think of\nthis as a genetic empiricism (Lowe 1995: 189), which makes\nclaims about the origins of our ideas. These claims take two forms.\nThe first of these is what we may call tabula rasa (blank\nslate) empiricism, which denies the existence of innate ideas or\nprinciples of reasoning, holding that both our factual knowledge and\nthe concepts we employ in describing the world are drawn from\nexperience. The modern locus classicus for an empiricism of\nthis kind is the work of John Locke, who famously suggested that the\nmind is originally \u201cwhite paper, void of all characters, without\nany ideas\u201d (Locke Essay 2.1.2). (For the history of\nthis idea, see\n sect. 3.3.3\n and\n sect. 4.1.)\n But it also takes the form of what we may describe as a cognitive\nempiricism. This denies that we have intellectual powers or\ncapacities that can give access to factual knowledge independently of\nexperience.\n\nCognitive empiricism may seem implicit in the tabula rasa\nprinciple that \u201cnothing is in the intellect which has not first\nbeen in the senses.\u201d But the two positions are not identical,\nfor one can deny that we have innate ideas or principles while also\nholding that the mind shapes what the senses provide. As G. W. Leibniz\n(1646\u20131716) would later remark, \u201cnothing is in the\nintellect which was not first in the senses, except for: the intellect\nitself (nisi intellectus ipse)\u201d (Leibniz NE\n1.2). There are two contributions the intellect could make. It could\npredispose us to understand what we perceive in certain ways. Or it\nmay have the capacity to receive a belief-forming influence from an\nexternal source, one not mediated by the senses. (For a medieval\nversion of the latter idea, see\n sect. 4.2.)\n A thorough-going cognitive empiricism would deny the existence of\neither innate dispositions or non-sensory influences in the formation\nof beliefs. It would hold that the mind forms its beliefs by\n\u201cselecting, combining, or otherwise manipulating simple ideas of\nsensation\u201d (Kahn 1981: 407).\n2.3 Justificatory Empiricism\n\nA final form of empiricism is what we may call justificatory\nempiricism. In its strongest form, an empiricism of this kind is\nindifferent as to the origins of our ideas and can tolerate inferences\nto unobservable entities. It merely insists that wherever our ideas\ncome from and whatever explanatory claims we make, these cannot be\nregarded as justified until they have been successfully tested against\nexperience. Within twentieth-century philosophy, this position is\nassociated with a sharp distinction between the \u201ccontext of\ndiscovery\u201d and the \u201ccontext of justification\u201d\n(Reichenbach 1938: 6\u20137), with justificatory empiricists focusing\non the latter. For Karl Popper (1902\u20131994), for instance, the\nquestion of how a theory is discovered is irrelevant to its epistemic\nstatus; what matters is whether that theory has explanatory power and\nhas withstood severe testing (Popper 1935 [2002: 7\u20138]). On the\nface of it, this does seem a recent position. Perhaps no philosopher\nbefore Popper would have regarded the origins of an idea as entirely\nirrelevant to its standing. But there are hints of a modest kind of\njustificatory empiricism in the work of some ancient and medieval\nthinkers, who held that factual claims arrived at by deductive\nreasoning lack credibility if they have not also been tested against\nexperience.\n3. Ancient Empiricism\n\nThe discussion that follows will employ these categories in order to\nanalyse the thought of ancient and medieval philosophers. Once again,\nthis may be thought to run the risk of anachronism, insofar as such\ncategories are not themselves ancient. Although one school of ancient\nthinkers did identify themselves as empiricists, no ancient or\nmedieval philosophers distinguished the three forms of empiricism I\nhave described. But this is not a fatal objection. We must be careful\nnot to distort the thinking of ancient or medieval philosophers by\nforcing it into modern categories, as into a Procrustean bed. Nor\nshould we write intellectual history in a \u201cWhiggish\u201d\nfashion, interested only in those features of ancient thought that\nanticipate our own. But as Allen Wood once remarked (a little too\nparadoxically), \u201cpeople can mean things they can\u2019t think,\nand therefore \u2026 must be able to express thoughts they\ncan\u2019t have\u201d (A. Wood 2002: 227). When it comes to ancient\nand medieval philosophers, our modern categories can help highlight\naspects of their thought they themselves may never have made\nexplicit.\n3.1 The Emergence of an Empiricist Attitude\n\nIf we think of empiricism as an attitude, rather than a clearly\nformulated doctrine, then it dates from the very beginnings of Western\nphilosophy, in the work of some Presocratic philosophers. Some care is\nneeded here, since we know of the Presocratics only through quotations\nand reports, found in authors who in some cases lived centuries later\nand who themselves had philosophical axes to grind. One of our major\nsources, for instance, is Aristotle. But Aristotle was not trying to\nwrite a carefully balanced history of philosophy; he was attempting to\nconstruct his own system and he sometimes reshaped his\npredecessors\u2019 views with this goal in mind (Cherniss 1935: 347).\nJudging from the quotations and reports we do have, it would be\ndifficult to describe the Presocratics as empiricists in practice.\nThere is little sign they engaged in what we would call\n\u201cempirical research\u201d: acts of observation intended to\ndiscover new facts or test hypotheses (Lloyd 1979: 139). Even if they\nhad, many of their claims about the natural world are sweeping and\nvague: it is far from clear how they could be tested empirically\n(Barnes 1982: 48). Despite this, some of the Presocratics did express\nsentiments that provide a foundation on which later empiricist\nthinkers could build.\n\nOf particular note are some sayings attributed to the Ionian\nphilosopher Heraclitus (fl. ca. 500 BCE). One fragment reads,\n\u201cThe things of which there is sight, hearing, experience,\n[these] I prefer\u201d (DK 22B55; Graham 2010: 149). Although the\ncontrast here may be between knowledge by experience and knowledge by\nhearsay (Kahn 1979: 106), it does suggest a confidence in knowledge\nthat comes from sense perception. It is, however, balanced by another\nsaying, which notes that \u201cpoor witnesses for men are the eyes\nand ears of those who have barbarian souls\u201d (DK 22B107; Graham\n2010: 149). This suggests that while the senses do provide knowledge,\nwhat they offer needs to be correctly understood. We find a similar\nattitude in Empedocles (ca. 495\u2013435 BCE), who, while emphasizing\nthe limits of human understanding, encourages his hearers to\n\u201cunderstand each thing in the way in which it is clear\u201d\n(noei d\u2019h\u0113i d\u0113lon hekaston, gleaning what\nknowledge they can from the senses (DK 31B3; Graham 2010: 343).\n\nEmpedocles\u2019s saying can be understood as a response to the work\nof the Eleatic philosophers, such as Parmenides (ca. 515\u2013445\nBCE) and Melissus of Samos (fl. ca. 440 BCE). Parmenides\nrelied on a priori arguments to reach conclusions that flew\nin the face of experience, while his follower Melissus argued for the\nunreliability of sense perception on the grounds that its deliverances\nwere contradicted by reason (Barnes 1982: 298\u2013302). Such\nteachings offered a challenge to the early scientific tradition\nestablished by Thales of Miletus (fl. ca. 585 BCE), for they\nsuggested that \u201cthe phenomena which science attempts to\nunderstand \u2026 are figments of our deceptive senses\u201d\n(Barnes 1982: 305). If there was to be a scientific tradition, it\nrequired a defence of sense perception over against pure reason.\n\nOther Presocratic thinkers take empiricism beyond a simple defence of\nsense perception; they also express suspicion regarding claims that go\nbeyond what can be observed. A key figure here is Xenophanes (ca.\n570\u2013475 BCE). Perhaps the best known of his sayings is fragment\n34: \u201cNo man knows, or ever will know, the truth about the gods\nand about everything I speak of; for even if one chanced to say the\nwhole truth, yet oneself knows it not; but seeming (dokos) is\nwrought over all things\u201d (DK 21B34; Kirk, Raven, & Schofield\n1983: 179). This is a cryptic saying, made more so by the fact that it\nlacks a context. But a plausible interpretation holds that in matters\ninaccessible to perception, we cannot be confident about the claims\nthat are made, since we have no way of independently verifying them\n(Hussey 1999: 22). Xenophanes\u2019s saying certainly expresses\ncaution about claimed knowledge of the gods. But if the phrase\n\u201ceverything I speak of\u201d refers to Xenophanes\u2019s\naccount of the physical world, it may also refer to knowledge of its\nunderlying principles (Barnes 1982: 139). Yet Xenophanes is no\nsceptic: he believes that growth in knowledge (broadly understood) is\npossible. As he is reported to have said, \u201cthe gods have not\nrevealed all things to men from the beginning; but by seeking men find\nout better in time\u201d (DK 21B18; Kirk, Raven, & Schofield\n1983: 179). Indeed Xenophanes himself seems to have made bold claims\nabout both the physical world and divinity. His empiricism is limited\nto the idea that in matters that go beyond what can be immediately\nexperienced we can expect to attain nothing more than \u201cbelief\n[dokos] and verisimilitude\u201d (Barnes 1982: 140).\n\nA striking feature of ancient empiricism is its association with\nmedical writers, and Xenophanes\u2019s caution about knowledge of the\nunseen is picked up by an early medical writer, Alcmaeon of Croton\n(fl. ca. 500 BCE), to whom the following fragment is attributed:\n\u201cConcerning things unseen (peri t\u014dn aphane\u014dn)\nthe gods see clearly, but so far as men may conjecture\n(tekmairesthai)\u2026 \u201d (DK 24B1; Kirk, Raven, &\nSchofield 1983: 339). Once again, it would be foolish to read a body\nof empiricist doctrine into such a cryptic (and apparently incomplete)\nremark. Yet it, too, indicates a contrast, not only between what the\ngods know and men may know (a commonplace of ancient Greek thought),\nbut between knowledge that can be obtained by observation and\nknowledge of \u201cthe unseen\u201d. Yet Alcmaeon himself appears to\nhave made claims regarding \u201cunseen matters\u201d (ta\naphan\u0113), not merely (as a medical writer) about the interior\nworkings of the body, but also about the soul and its immortality. So\nit would be mistaken to regard him as an explanatory empiricist,\nrejecting inferences to what is unseen. Indeed in its original\ncontext, the remark may have suggested that despite the difficulties\nof knowing what is unseen, careful investigation allows us to make\nsuch inferences (Huffman 2021: sect. 2.1). Indeed while\ntekmairesthai can mean \u201cconjecture\u201d, it can also\nmean to infer from \u201csigns\u201d (tekm\u0113ria), a\nphrase that would later be used for inferences from what can be\nobserved\n (sect. 3.3.3)\n\nStaying within the medical tradition, a similar caution about\nknowledge of \u201cthings unseen\u201d can be found in some of the\nworks attributed to Hippocrates (ca. 460\u2013370 BCE). The author of\none Hippocratic treatise argues against those who practice medicine on\nthe basis of some general principle or postulate\n(hupothesis). Medicine, he suggests, does not require a\ngeneral theory \u201cabout human nature\u201d (ho ti estin\nanthr\u014dpos), of the kind offered by Empedocles and other\nphilosophers (AM 20.1). Such general principles may be\nrequired when dealing with with matters that are \u201cobscure and\ndubious\u201d, such as \u201cthe things in the sky or under the\nearth\u201d (AM 1.3). But medicine differs from such\nspeculative sciences, since its conclusions can be confirmed by\nexperience. Of particular note here is the phrase \u201cthe things in\nthe sky or under the earth,\u201d which picks out the main areas of\nearly Ionian science (Barnes 1982: 139; cf. Plato Ap.\n18b8\u20139), regarding knowledge of which the author seems to be\nexpressing caution.\n\nAt first sight, this looks like an early expression of explanatory\nempiricism: a refusal to make inferences to things that cannot be\nobserved. But as in the case of Xenophanes and Alcaemon, it is better\nregarded as the expression of an empiricist attitude than an\nempiricist doctrine. Even leaving aside the fact that \u201cthe\nthings in the sky\u201d are not strictly unobservable, the same\nHippocratic work also speaks of discovering facts about what is inside\nthe body \u201cfrom evident things outside [the body]\u201d\n(AM 22.3). In particular, it argues, we can draw conclusions\nabout the body\u2019s internal organs by noting the behaviour of\ndifferent kinds of observable objects: those that are solid,\nstretched, spongy, porous, and so on. (The reasoning here is by way of\nanalogy, a common practice among the earliest Greek thinkers [Lloyd\n1992: 254\u201355; Allen 2001: 10\u201311].) This appears\ninconsistent with an explanatory empiricism, since it justifies\ninferences from what can be observed to what is (at least in practice)\nunobservable.\n\nTalk of discovering what is unseen from what is evident calls to mind\nthe maxim attributed to Anaxagoras (ca. 500\u2013428 BCE):\n\u201cAppearances are a vision of the invisible\u201d (hopsis\n\u2026 t\u014dn ad\u0113l\u014dn ta phainomena) (DK 59B21a;\nGraham 2010: 309). Not only was this principle employed in the\nHippocratic writings, but it was said to have been endorsed by\nDemocritus (ca. 460\u2013371 BCE) (Sextus M VII 1.140). For\nall his scepticism regarding sense perception (DK 68B6\u201310;\nGraham 2010: 592\u201395), Democritus seemed to think it had an\nevidential role (Asmis 1984: 345). In particular, he apparently\nbelieved it could confirm the atomist theory which Leucippus\n(fl. ca. 450\u2013420 BCE) had originated and he himself had\nembraced. There is, however, a difficulty here, as Democritus himself\nmay have realized, for in one report he has the senses utter the\nfollowing: \u201cWretched mind, after taking from us your evidence,\ndo you overthrow us? Our fall will be your defeat!\u201d (DK 68B125;\nGraham 2010: 597). The problem here is that while one can cite\nobservable facts (such as the fact of motion) in support of atomism,\nthat doctrine in turn suggests that appearances are deceptive (Barnes\n1982: 559\u201364), since the world does not appear to be made up of\natoms. As another fragment reads, \u201cby convention color, by\nconvention sweet, by convention bitter, but in reality atoms and\nvoid\u201d (DK 68B9, 125; Graham 2010: 597). This contrast between\nwhat appears to be the case (which we accept \u201cby\nconvention\u201d) and what is actually the case threatens the\nundermine the atomist\u2019s appeal to the evidence of the\nsenses.\n\nWhat we find, then, in the work of some of the earliest Greek\nphilosophers is not only the first outline of empiricist doctrines; we\nalso find hints of the difficulties such doctrines would encounter.\nBut to find a clearer statement of an empiricist view of knowledge, we\nmust turn to the work of Aristotle.\n3.2 Aristotle\u2019s Empiricism\n\nAristotle discussed a variety of ways in which human beings can\nachieve a grasp of reality. In particular, he mentions five ways in\nwhich \u201cthe soul possesses the truth by way of affirmation or\ndenial\u201d (EN 1139b15\u201317): art or craft\n(techn\u0113), scientific knowledge\n(epist\u0113m\u0113), practical wisdom\n(phron\u0113sis), philosophical wisdom (sophia), and\ncomprehension (nous). These are, however, varieties of\nknowledge; this remark does not tell us about the origins of what we\nknow. So was Aristotle an empiricist? Answering this question is not a\nstraightforward task. While Aristotle does offer us a description of\n\u201csystematic theoretical knowledge\u201d (Pasnau 2013:\n992)\u2014namely, the Posterior Analytics\u2014he offers us\nno analysis of knowledge in general (Taylor 1990: 117).\n\nWe do know, however, that Aristotle believed the senses to be\nreliable, and that we must rely on their deliverances for our\nknowledge of factual matters. Although he insisted that \u201cnot\neverything that appears is true (ou pan to phainomenon\nal\u0113thes)\u201d (Met. 1010b2\u20133), he regarded\nthings as they appear (ta phainomena) as the starting point\nof any inquiry and conformity with them the indication of its success.\nAlthough he uses the phrase ta phainomena broadly\u2014it\nembraces endoxa, \u201creputable opinions\u201d as well as\nwhat is immediately evident to the senses (Owen 1986:\n240)\u2014Aristotle regarded sensation (aith\u0113sis) as\nparticularly trustworthy. Each of the senses has its own proper\nobjects (such as color, in the case of sight) and our grasp of these\nis \u201cis true or [at least] admits the lowest degree of\nfalsehood\u201d (DA 428b18\u201319; cf. 418a11). Not only\nis sensation, at this lowest level, trustworthy, but it is our only\nsource of knowledge when it comes to contingent matters of fact. As\nAristotle writes, \u201cno one can learn anything at all in the\nabsence of sense\u201d and that even when we are not actively\nperceiving, our thinking remains dependent on sensory images\n(DA 432a7\u20139). Insofar as Aristotle\u2019s view of\nknowledge insists on both the reliability of the senses and their\nessential role in the gaining of knowledge, it can be thought of as\nbroadly empiricist.\n\nTo gain a better understand of the nature and limits of\nAristotle\u2019s empiricism, we must once again make some\ndistinctions. Aristotle can be classed as a genetic\nempiricist, for he rejects the claim that we have innate ideas or\nprinciples of reasoning. He is also, arguably, an explanatory\nempiricist, although in a different sense from that found among\nHellenistic medical writers and Sceptics\n (sect. 3.3).\n We can regard him as a modest kind of justificatory\nempiricist, who believes that scientific theorizing is answerable to\nwhat can be observed. But what is contested is whether he can be said\nto be a cognitive empiricist, given the role of intellectual\ninsight in his account of scientific explanation.\n\nWith regard to genetic empiricism, Aristotle rejects the doctrine of\ninnate ideas found in the work of Plato (427\u2013347 BCE). He\nstrongly denies, for instance, that we have innate knowledge of the\nprinciples of scientific demonstration (APo. 100a;\nMet. 993a). This aspect of Aristotle\u2019s empiricism can\nbe illustrated by his attitude to mathematics. For Plato, mathematical\nobjects resemble the Forms\u2014some may in fact be Forms (Shapiro\n2000: 54\u201355)\u2014which occupy a timeless realm distinct from\nthat of the objects of sensation (Rep. 510c1\u2013511b2).\nThey are known, therefore, either by recollection\n(anamn\u0113sis) or by a kind of direct intellectual\nintuition. Along with his rejection of innate ideas, Aristotle also\nrejects this conception of mathematical objects. What the\nmathematician grasps are real features of perceptible objects, but\nregarded in a particular way (Lear 1982: 168, 184). They are regarded\nmerely \u201cas\u201d (h\u0113i) having quantity and being\ncontinuous or as objects of enumeration (Phys.\n193b22\u2013194a10; Met. 1061a28\u20131061b3,\n1077b19\u20131078a4, 1078a22\u201328).\n\nIs Aristotle an explanatory empiricist? Aristotle does accept the need\nfor inferences from what can be observed to facts that are not\nimmediately evident (Asmis 1984: 212\u201317). As he writes,\n\u201cto gain light on things imperceptible we must use the evidence\nof perceptible things\u201d (EN 1104a13\u201314). It\nfollows that something perceived can serve as a sign of something that\nwe would not otherwise know. Roughness of the tongue, for example, is\na sign (s\u0113meion) of fever (DS 462b26\u201332);\nthe large size of hailstones is a sign (s\u0113meion) they\nhave been formed close to the earth (Meteor.\n348a33\u201336). But while knowledge of signs constitutes evidence,\nit does not, in itself, represent scientific knowledge. Scientific\nknowledge is knowledge not just of facts, but of their causes. Even if\nthe association between sign and signified is without exception, so\nthat one can infer the latter from the former, such an inference is\nnot the same as offering an explanation. It may be, for instance, that\nfever is a reliable sign of illness (Rhet. 1357b18\u201319):\nall those with fever have an underlying medical condition. But this\ndoes not yet constitute an explanation, for it does not yet show that\nthe fever is a necessary consequence of the illness. A sign, in other\nwords, can establish only what Aristotle calls \u201cthe fact\u201d\n(to hoti); showing a correlation between sign and signified\ndoes not, in itself, establish the \u201creasoned fact\u201d (to\ndioti) (Madden 1952: 372; cf. APo. 78a23).\n\nSo when it comes to establishing the \u201creasoned\nfact\u201d\u2014the process of scientific explanation\u2014is\nAristotle an explanatory empiricist? Would he deny the legitimacy of\ninferences from observed facts to unobserved (or, perhaps,\nunobservable) causes? Aristotle is cautious regarding our ability to\nknow about matters that cannot be directly observed. As he writes,\nwhen it comes to \u201cmatters inaccessible to the senses,\u201d it\nis sufficient if our investigation arrives at a possible cause\n(Meteor. 344a5\u20137). Insofar as he allows inferences of\nthis kind, Aristotle is not an explanatory empiricist. But the phrase\n\u201cexplanatory empiricism\u201d does not quite fit the shape of\nAristotle\u2019s natural philosophy. Firstly, explanatory empiricism\nstands in an epistemological tradition whose central question is\n\u201cWhat are we justified in believing?\u201d That tradition has\nits origins in later, Hellenistic philosophy\n (sect. 3.3);\n its concerns are not Aristotle\u2019s (Burnyeat 1981: 136). Second,\nwhat Aristotelian explanations appeal to are the \u201ccauses and\nprinciples (aitia kai archai)\u201d\u2014terms Aristotle\nuses interchangeably (Witt 1989: 18)\u2014by which phenomena are made\nintelligible. Some of these \u201cgenerative factors\u201d\n(Moravcsik 1975: 622) are inherent in (enuparchousai) the\nthings to be explained, while others are outside (ektos)\n(Met. 1013a19\u201320; APo. 93a6\u20137). Only the\ngenerative factors that lie outside the fact to be explained (in the\nsense of being distinct from it) could be thought of as unobservable\nentities. The generative factors that are inherent in things are not\nunobservable in the same sense as atoms (for instance) would be. They\nmay still be \u201cnot evident\u201d but in a different sense: it is\nnot always evident that a class of entities share a common nature.\nEstablishing this fact requires \u201cinduction\u201d\n(epag\u014dg\u0113), to which I shall return in a moment.\n\nWhat about justificatory empiricism? It seems that no ancient or\nmedieval thinker would have endorsed a strong form of justificatory\nempiricism, which holds that the origins of a theory are irrelevant to\nits epistemic status. But many did insist that all scientific\ntheorizing was answerable to experience. Aristotle certainly did so.\nAs he remarks, \u201cwe should accept what is evident to the senses\nrather than [mere] reasoning,\u201d and reasoning only if it agrees\nwith the observed facts (GA 760b29\u201333). He had little\nsympathy with the idea that the natural world could be explained in an\nentirely a priori fashion, as Plato sometimes suggests (e.g.\nRep. 530b7\u20138, 531c1\u20135). He criticizes, for\ninstance, the Pythagoreans for forcing their observations of the\nheavens to accord with theory, rather than seeking theories that\naccount for what can be seen to occur (DC 293a25\u201327).\nAristotle is particularly dismissive of the Eleatic philosophers, who\nin their reasoning \u201ctranscended sense perception and disregarded\nit on the grounds of following the argument.\u201d He notes that\nwhile their opinions are supported by reason, it would be\n\u201calmost madness to believe them, when one considers the\nfacts\u201d (GC 325a18\u201320). The facts in question are\nthose revealed by the senses.\n\nIf there is a feature of Aristotle\u2019s thought that may appear to\ncast doubt on his empiricism, it is the account of scientific\nexplanation found in his Posterior Analytics. (I am assuming\nthis is an account of scientific explanation, rather than an account\nof how we form everyday concepts [Scott 1995: 109\u201316].)\nAristotle\u2019s conception of scientific explanation is deductive:\nit involves a derivation of the fact to be explained from first\nprinciples, the latter being \u201ctrue, primary, immediate, better\nknown than and prior to the conclusion, the latter being related to\nthem as effect to cause\u201d (APo. 71b20\u201324). There\nhas been much debate regarding the role of such demonstrations. A\nwidely-held view is that they are not, for Aristotle, a means of\nmaking scientific discoveries. Rather, they are the way in which such\ndiscoveries should be presented (Barnes 1994, xii). Indeed Aristotle\nexpressly denies we can discover explanatory principles by way of\ndemonstration, holding that such demonstrations serve merely to make\nthem clear (APo. 93b16\u201318). This view seems consistent\nwith Aristotle\u2019s practice in his own scientific writings, as\nwell as the methodological remarks found in his biological works. He\nargues, for instance, that when studying animals \u201cwe ought first\nto take the phenomena that are observed in each group, and then go on\nto state their causes\u201d (PA 640a15). While we should not\nconfuse Aristotle\u2019s empiricism with that of Francis Bacon\n(Harari 2004: 35), even his theorizing can be said to begin with what\nis observed.\n\nIt remains true, however, that Aristotle\u2019s ideal presentation of\na scientific explanation is that of a demonstration from first\nprinciples. Only such a demonstration, he believes, would make clear\nthe necessary connection that constitutes a causal relation. While\nthis ideal is not always attainable (Pasnau 2013: 993), it remains a\ndesideratum. So how does one arrive at those principles? It\nis at this point that one might question whether Aristotle truly is an\nempiricist. The principles to which scientific demonstrations appeal\nare universals: they are properties common to all beings of a\nparticular kind which constitute them as beings of that kind.\nAristotle rejects the Platonic idea that such universal properties\nexist extra rem, independently of the individuals that embody\nthem. So in order to arrive at the principles of scientific\nexplanation we need to recognize the identity of kind among the forms\nof particular objects and thus the universal that is embodied in each\nof them (Owens 1966: 168). The process by which we come to grasp the\nuniversals required for scientific explanations is known as\nepag\u014dg\u0113 (APo. 99b15\u2013100b15), a term\ncommonly translated as \u201cinduction.\u201d\n\nWhat Aristotle means by induction (epag\u014dg\u0113) is\nnotoriously unclear (Ross 1949: 50; Harari 2004: 33\u201334), but\nAristotle customarily distinguishes induction from syllogistic\nreasoning, in the sense of demonstration. As he writes in one place,\n\u201call our beliefs come either through demonstration [dia\nsullogismou] or from induction [ex\nepag\u014dg\u0113s]\u201d (APr. 68b13). The general\ncontrast here is that while \u201cdemonstration proceeds from\nuniversals to particulars,\u201d induction takes one \u201cfrom\nparticulars to universals\u201d (Ross 1949: 47; cf. Top.\n195a13\u201314). It is sensation (sense-perception:\naisth\u0113sis) that gives us knowledge of particulars\n(APo. 81b6\u20137), while knowledge of universals is\nrequired for scientific knowledge (epist\u0113m\u0113). So\nwhat is epag\u014dg\u0113, process by which we move from\nperceived particulars to known universals?\n\nAristotle denies (as we have seen) that the universals that form the\nprinciples of a scientific demonstration are themselves to be reached\nby way of demonstration (APo. 72b19\u201320;\n93b16\u201318). But a demonstration (sullogismos) is a\nstrong form of argument, in which conclusions follow necessarily from\nthe premises (APr. 24b18\u201320). So one might think that\nsome weaker form of reasoning could be involved, such as\n\u201cinduction\u201d in our modern sense: a generalization over a\ncollection of particulars. The latter gives rise to the notorious\n\u201cproblem of induction\u201d\n (sect. 4.2),\n of which Aristotle shows some awareness (Top.\n131b19\u201336): how can any limited range of observations justify a\nuniversal claim? But even leaving this problem aside, there is a\nserious objection to understanding Aristotle\u2019s\nepag\u014dg\u0113 in this way. The most such a generalization\ncould show that all individuals of a certain class have certain\ncharacteristics (APo. 92a37\u201392b2): that all swans are\nwhite, for instance. It could not tell us that this characteristic is\nessential, one of the features that constitutes a swan as a swan. In\nany case, Aristotle also suggests that each of the principles of\nscientific explanation is in some sense self-evident: it\n\u201ccommands belief of itself\u201d (kath\u2019heaut\u0113n\neinai pist\u0113n) (Top. 100b19\u201322). This seems to\nexclude the idea that these principles are reached by a process of\nreasoning.\n\nIf we reject the idea that Aristotelian epag\u014dg\u0113 is\na form of enumerative induction, we might be tempted to think of it as\na kind of \u201cimmediate apprehension of essences or forms\u201d\n(Harari 2004: 34), one that occurs in the very process of perceiving\nparticular individuals of a given kind. (This interpretation often\ngoes along with a conception of nous as a faculty of\nintuition [Kahn 1981: 369], rather than a state of understanding\n[Barnes 1994: 267\u201369].) But if epag\u014dg\u0113\ninvolves a process of intellectual intuition that goes beyond what\nsense-perception delivers, it would undercut the claim that Aristotle\nis a genetic (and, perhaps, justificatory) empiricist. Experience\nwould provide nothing more than the occasion on which the necessary\nintuitive insight is gained.\n\nSo is there a way of understanding epag\u014dg\u0113 that\nallows Aristotle to be thought of as an empiricist? One possible\nsolution begins with Aristotle\u2019s puzzling claim that while\n\u201cit is the particular that we sense (aisthanetai men to\nkath\u2019hekaston), sensation is of the universal (h\u0113\nd\u2019aisth\u0113sis tou katholou estin)\u201d (APo.\n100a17\u2013b1). Why is this puzzling? It is puzzling since Aristotle\nelsewhere states that sensation gives us knowledge of particulars, not\nuniversals (APo. 81b6\u20137). So in what sense can\nsensation also be \u201cof the universal\u201d? Various solutions to\nthis question have been offered (Hasker & Yurdin 2014:\n127\u2013130). One solution starts from a remark found at the\nbeginning of the Physics, where Aristotle writes that the\nthings that are immediately apparent to us (and thus the starting\npoint of inquiry) are \u201crather confused\u201d (mallon\nsunkechumena) (Phys. 184a22). Those rather confused\nthings are apparently general facts, for he goes on to remark that\n\u201cit is the whole that is better known to sensation\u201d (Phys.\n184a24\u201325). This suggests that \u201cwe begin by responding\nperceptually to undifferentiated \u2018wholes\u2019\u201d\n(Gasser-Wingate 2021: 149). Only later, by way of analysis\n(Phys. 184a22\u201323), do we come \u201cto recognize the\nspecific nature of that whose generic nature alone is at first\nrecognized\u201d (Ross 1936: 458). On this view, experience\n(empeiria) already gives us a knowledge of universals, but\none that is not yet precise. The \u201cmerely experienced\u201d\nperson is responding reliably to the features that unite entities of a\nkind, but has not yet understood what those features are.\n\nDoes this interpretation solve the problems created by an empiricist\nunderstanding of Aristotle\u2019s idea of science? One objection is\nthat on an Aristotelian view the principles of scientific\nunderstanding must be not merely properties that objects happen to\nhave; they must be properties that objects of this kind necessarily\npossess (Kahn 1981: 389). Can we explain our ability to grasp such\nnecessary properties without invoking some purely intellectual power\nof intuition? Some commentators deny that we can. (See, for instance,\nGaukroger 1978: 124.) One interesting suggestion is that our grasp of\nnecessary properties could arise from our interaction with things,\nthrough our experience of the constraints that the world imposes on\nthat interaction (De Groot 2014: 69). But it is unclear if even this\nkind of experience can yield the strong sense of necessity that an\nAristotelian conception of science demands.\n3.3 Hellenistic Philosophy\n\nA philosopher of whom Aristotle was very critical, but who is worthy\nof mention in this context, is Plato\u2019s nephew and successor\nSpeusippus (ca. 408\u2013339 BCE). Plato\u2019s school, the Academy,\neventually became the home of Scepticism\n (sect. 3.3.4),\n but before it did so Speusippus had come up with a modified view of\nthe capabilities of sense-perception. While not himself an\nempiricist\u2014Speusippus speaks of two criteria of truth, of which\nsense perception is just one (Sextus M VII\n1.145\u201348)\u2014he does suggest that the capacity of\nsense-perception (aisth\u0113sis) can be enhanced when it is\ncombined with reason (logos). In a way that bridges the\nPlatonic gap between the \u201cintelligible\u201d and the\n\u201csensible\u201d, he speak of the resulting synthesis as\n\u201ccognitive sense-perception\u201d (epist\u0113mik\u0113\naisth\u0113sis), which is the faculty that allows us to discern\nobjects and states of affairs (Dillon 2003: 79). It is, however,\nconsistent with Speusippus\u2019s Platonism that he would have\nregarded knowledge of physical objects as merely \u201capparent\nknowledge\u201d; true knowledge was of the eternal mathematical forms\nthat underlay them (Dillon 2003: 80, 82).\n\nFor clearer examples of empiricist doctrine we can turn to the\nthinkers of the Hellenistic age (a roughly 300-year period following\nthe death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, although my survey will\nextend into the second century CE). These include medical writers and\nSceptics, Epicurus (ca. 341\u2013270 BCE) and his followers, and the\nschool founded by founded by Zeno of Citium (ca. 332\u2013265 BCE),\nwhose members are known as Stoics. The medical writers and Sceptics\noffer a sophisticated form of explanatory empiricism. The followers of\nEpicureans offer a strong view of the reliability of sense perception,\nwhich is their \u201ccriterion\u201d of truth, making them\njustificatory empiricists. But they were not explanatory empiricists,\nsince they accepted inferences to what is \u201cnot evident\u201d\n(ad\u0113lon), such as the existence and activity of atoms.\nThe Stoics hold to a form of genetic empiricism, in ways that resemble\nmodern uses of the tabula rasa metaphor, and share (broadly\nspeaking) the Epicurean view of the criterion of truth. But at least\nwhen it comes to moral notions, they modify their empiricism by\ninsisting that humans are predisposed to form certain beliefs, beliefs\nabout what is just and good. No more than the Epicureans are the\nStoics explanatory empiricists: they accept the legitimacy (under\ncertain conditions) of inferences to what is not evident to the\nsenses. The strongest critics of the Stoic view were the Sceptics, who\nargued that while we can \u201cgo along with\u201d what is evident\nfor practical purposes, we should practise suspension of belief\n(epoch\u0113), so as to attain tranquillity of mind\n(ataraxia).\n3.3.1 Medical Writers\n\nThe first people to describe themselves as empiricists\n(empeirikoi) were a group of medical writers of the\nHellenistic period. We know of these thinkers only indirectly, through\nthe work of other ancient writers, in particular Galen of Pergamon\n(129\u2013ca. 200 CE). As medical practitioners, their primary\nconcerns were practical: finding the correct method of diagnosis and\ntreatment. But in discussing these matters they put forward some\ngeneral epistemological claims, developing the empiricist tendencies\nalready found in the Hippocratic writings\n (sect. 3.1).\n In particular, they set themselves in opposition to those whom they\ncalled \u201crationalists\u201d (logikoi) or\n\u201cdogmatists\u201d (dogmatikoi). What set them apart\nwas a refusal to posit causes beyond those that can be observed.\n\nIn spelling out their position the medical empiricists distinguished\nbetween two styles of inference. What they rejected was the variety of\nreasoning they called \u201canalogism\u201d (analogismos),\nwhich \u201cstarts from what is apparent but ends up with what is\nentirely unclear\u201d (Galen SB ch. 5). In its place they\nadvocated what they called \u201cepilogism\u201d\n(epilogimos), which deals \u201csolely with what is\napparent,\u201d but can be used \u201cto discover what is currently\nunseen\u201d (Galen SB ch. 5). The idea here is that while\nthe cause that is inferred may be currently hidden, the inference is\nbased on an association that is, at other times, directly observable.\nEpilogismos, the empiricists argued, is a form of reasoning\nused by all human beings, which leads to a consensus, while\nanalogismos leads to disagreement and conclusions that can be\nneither confirmed nor denied (Galen ME ch. 24).\n\nThe tradition of medical empiricism influenced the work of Galen\nhimself, although his preferred method involved the use of both\nlogos (reason) and empeiria (experience). As Galen\nwrote, \u201clogos alone discovers some remedies,\npeira [\u2018experiment\u2019 or \u2018trial\u2019]\nwithout employing logos [discovers] others, while some\nrequire both of them working together\u201d (Galen Op. 13,\npp. 886\u2013887; Hankinson 2022: 104). Galen is what I have called a\njustificatory empiricist in that he believes all factual knowledge to\nrely on the evidence of the senses, which are assumed to be broadly\nreliable (Hankinson 2009: 214\u201315). Galen\u2019s justificatory\nempiricism is revealed in his conviction that there are philosophical\nquestions that simply cannot be resolved, because perceptual\nexperience gives us no way of adjudicating them. Such questions\ninclude whether the world is created or uncreated, whether its extent\nis finite or infinite, and whether God is corporeal or incorporeal\n(Hankinson 2009: 228\u201329). Galen is not, however, an explanatory\nempiricist, since he thinks there are non-evident causal factors that\nwe can discover. Indeed the proper practice of medicine requires us to\ndiscover them (Hankinson 2022: 91). It is for this reason that he\nopposes the belief of the medical empiricists that experience alone\nsuffices for the practice of medicine. Rejecting, as they do, the\nsearch for underlying causes, such practitioners have \u201cno\nsystematic way of determining therapy in cases which are unlike those\nwhich they have come across before\u201d (Hankinson 2022: 87).\n\nGalen shares what appears to be Aristotle\u2019s view: that sense\nperception already gives us a knowledge of the first principles of\nscientific knowledge, although such knowledge can be made explicit\nonly by reasoned analysis. The reasoning in question is akin to that\nof a geometer, \u201cworking back from a problem \u2026 to the\naxioms from which the problem can be solved, or the facts\nexplained\u201d (Hankinson 2009: 223). The doctor\u2019s craft\n(techn\u0113) therefore involves not just experience but what\nwe may call \u201creasoned experience\u201d (Hankinson 2022: 104).\nSuch reasoning allows one to discern the conditions under which a\ntherapeutic substance will manifest its powers (van der Eijk 2005:\n289\u201390). Galen refers to experience of this kind as\n\u201cdifferentiated experience\u201d (di\u014drismen\u0113\npeira) (Galen Op. 11, p. 685), which can allow one\nto discover causal powers even from a single trial (Hankinson 2022:\n106). This idea of differentiated experience brings us very close to\nthe theory (if not the practice) of what we call \u201ccontrolled\nexperiments\u201d (Singer 2022: 185).\n\nExperience in this context is not passive, a mere reception of\nsense-data. As in the case of Speusippus\u2019s \u201ccognitive\nsense perception\u201d, which like the performance of a musician can\nbe improved by practice (Sextus M VII 1.146), the perceptual\nability of the skilled practitioner can be improved by reason and\neffort. Galen\u2019s example of this is his ultimately successful\nstruggle to perceive the systole of the pulse, which reason had taught\nhim must exist (Singer 2022: 171\u201372). In the case of experience\ntrained by reason and practice, the gap between observable effect and\nunobservable cause narrows to the point of disappearing. If we use the\nterm \u201cperceiving\u201d broadly (Galen Op. 8, p. 793),\ntrained experience can be said to make manifest the causal factors\nthat produce our experience (Singer 2022: 174).\n\nSuch claims seem overly optimistic. Galen fails to take into account\nthe degree to which theory is underdetermined by data. Skilled Chinese\nphysicians, when taking a pulse, \u201cperceived\u201d quite\ndifferent causal factors, since their perception was informed by a\ndiffering kind of medical practice and body of theory (Kuriyama 1999:\n25, 37). In this respect, Galen\u2019s philosophy of science faces\nthe same difficulties as Aristotle\u2019s (to which it is closely\nrelated). Can it explain how observation could lead to an explanation\nthat is necessarily true, given the evidence (Hankinson 2022:\n110)?\n3.3.2 Epicureans\n\nAs will already be evident, the early medical writers were also\nphilosophers. But among the specifically philosophical Hellenistic\nschools, the first I shall consider is that of the Epicureans.\nEpicurus and his followers had little interest in a study of the\nnatural world for its own sake. The Epicurean movement can be regarded\nas a \u201csecular religion\u201d (Milton 2002: 182), which aimed to\nachieve a knowledge of nature only insofar as this promoted peace of\nmind. (For a more vigorous defence of the scientific credentials of\nEpicureanism, see Asmis 1984.) But in working out their philosophy the\nEpicureans develop a distinctive form of empiricism. It is, first of\nall, a genetic empiricism, holding that the evidence of the senses is\n\u201cthe base and foundation\u201d of all our knowledge (Sextus\nM VII 1.216). But it differs from some other forms of\nempiricism both in regarding as infallible the immediate deliverances\nof perception and allowing for the mind to be affected by external\nobjects in ways independent of the five senses. Epicurean empiricism\nis also more tolerant than that of the medical writers and Sceptics,\nsince it accepts inferences to unobservable causes. It is not, in\nother words, an explanatory empiricism. Indeed this seems to be the\nreason why the sceptical Sextus counts Epicureans among the\n\u201cdogmatists\u201d (Sextus PH 1.3).\n\nIn a work entitled On the Criterion or The Canon (Peri\nkrit\u0113riou \u0113 kan\u014dn), Epicurus is said to have\nargued that all sensations (aisth\u0113seis) are reliable,\nthere being nothing that can refute them (Diogenes La\u00ebrtius [DL]\n10.31). Sextus sums up this Epicurean doctrine as the view that\n\u201call sensed things \u2026 are true and existent\u201d (Sextus\nM VII 2.9). On the face of it, this seems an untenable\nposition. Do our senses not deceive us? Do we not see sticks as bent\nwhere they enter water or a distant large object as small? There are\ntwo responses an Epicurean can make. The first is to make a clear\ndistinction (comparable to that made by Aristotle\n [sect. 3.2])\n between our sensations and the opinions we form on the basis of what\nwe sense. When it comes to our opinions, Epicurus held that\n\u201csome them are true and others are false, since they are\njudgements of ours concerning what appears, and we judge sometimes\nrightly and sometimes wrongly\u201d (Sextus M VII 1.210).\nWhen we make mistakes, in other words, it is not the senses that are\nto blame. Secondly, the senses are verdical because sensations are not\n\u201cpurely private mental phenomena\u201d (O\u2019Keefe 2010:\n100). They are brought about by the objects of which they testify,\nwhich emit a continuous flow of images or simulacra\n(eid\u014dla) from their surfaces (Epicurus Ep. Hdt.\n46\u201351). On this view, the senses are reliably informative,\nfaithfully reflecting the objects that produced them, even if we later\nattribute to them a false propositional content.\n\nEpicurean empiricism is, however, a relatively tolerant form of\nempiricism. It is tolerant, first of all, insofar as it does not\nrestrict perception to what is received by way of the five senses.\nEpicurus and his followers seem to have regarded the mind itself as a\nkind of \u201csupersense\u201d (DeWitt 1954: 207\u20139), capable\nof receiving eid\u014dla on its own account. (This doctrine\nbears some resemblance to one of the Buddhist beliefs mentioned\nearlier\n [sect. 1].)\n The Epicurean writer Lucretius (ca. 95\u201354 BCE), for instance,\nclaims that some of the simulacra thrown off by objects are\nexceedingly fine, such that they can penetrate the body and affect the\nmind independently of the five senses. This allows him to account for\nthe images we see in dreams, which accurately reflect aspects of the\nworld, although in a manner that deceives us (Lucretius RN\n4.722\u201331, 5.1168\u201371).\n\nEpicurean empiricism is also tolerant insofar as it rejects what I\nhave called \u201cexplanatory empiricism\u201d: it does allow for\nexplanatory inferences to unobservable entities. More precisely,\nEpicurus speaks of two kinds of inferences from what is perceived to\nwhat is currently unobserved. The first is an inference to \u201cthat\nwhich awaits confirmation\u201d (to prosmenon); the second\nis an inference to \u201cthat which is non-evident\u201d (to\nad\u0113lon) (Epicurus Ep. Hdt. 38.10). Discussing the\nviews of Epicureans and other dogmatists, Sextus makes a similar\ndistinction (PH 2.97\u201398). He speaks, firstly, of an\ninference to something that is \u201cfor the moment\u201d (pros\nkairon) non-evident, but which will become evident in due course.\nHis example is the city of Athens, which (assuming I am not at Athens)\nwill become evident to me if I travel there. This corresponds to\nEpicurus\u2019s \u201cthat which awaits confirmation\u201d (DL\n10.34). But Sextus also speaks of entities that are \u201cnon-evident\nby nature (ta \u2026 phusei ad\u0113la)\u201d, a category\nthat corresponds to Epicurus\u2019s \u201cnon-evident.\u201d Some\ndogmatists, Sextus writes, regards the existence and activity of such\nas knowable by inference, an example being the Epicurean (and\nDemocritean) belief in atoms moving in the void (Sextus M VII\n2.319). Note that Sextus adds to these two a third category: that of\nmatters which are \u201caltogether non-evident\u201d (ta\nkathapax ad\u0113la) (PH 2.97), which even dogmatists\nagreed could never be known by any kind of inference, his example\nbeing whether the number of stars is odd or even.\n\nOn the Epicurean view, what kinds of inference could be used to\nsupported belief in unobservable entities? In the case of entities\nunobservable only \u201cfor the moment,\u201d the answer is clear.\nOne can make a conjecture and then test it when the entity in question\nbecomes observable (Sextus M VII 1.212). But in the case of\nthings that are \u201cnon-evident by nature,\u201d only indirect\nconfirmation is possible. Epicurus\u2019s view appears to have been\nthat a hypothesis consistent with experience\u2014one that is not\n\u201cwitnessed against\u201d\u2014can and should be accepted\n(Sextus M VII 1.216). But of course two or more hypotheses\nmay survive this test. Remarkably, Epicurus and his followers seem to\nhave held that in these circumstances they can all be accepted, not\njust as possible, but as true, being realized at some time or in some\nplace (Allen 2004: 95; cf. Lucretius RN 5.526\u201333).\nWhile this may have seemed plausible in a universe infinite in extent\nand unlimited in time, it leaves open the question of which of these\nexplanations applies to the particular case we are interested in.\nEpicurus seems to have held that we should not expect to be able to\nanswer this question, in every case (Ep. Pyth. 86). Nor do we\nneed to do so; the knowledge that an event has some natural\nexplanation is sufficient to free us from a superstitious fear of the\ngods (Ep. Pyth. 87). (For the more restrictive view that this\ntolerance of multiple explanations applied only to \u201cexplanations\nof celestial phenomena\u201d, see Sedley 1982: 269\u201371.)\n3.3.3 Stoics\n\nA second school of Hellenistic philosophy that can be classed as\nempiricist is that of the Stoics, whose view of knowledge owes much to\nthe thought of the Epicureans (Scott 1995: 162, 185). Picking up (it\nseems) an image from Plato (Theaetetus 191c9\u201310),\nAristotle had spoken of the mind using a metaphor akin to that of the\ntabula rasa (DA 430a1). But Aristotle\u2019s use of\nthe metaphor is not identical with that of later empiricists, for what\nhe was speaking of was not so much the initial state of the mind as\nits capacity to receive knowledge (Polansky 2007: 454). The\nStoics\u2019 use of a similar metaphor is more clearly an expression\nof a genetic empiricism: the idea that we have no innate ideas or\nprinciples of reasoning. \u201cWhen a man is born\u201d, they are\nsaid to have claimed, \u201che has the regent part of his soul like a\nsheet of papyrus (chartion) well-prepared for making a\ntranscript\u201d (\u00c4etius, Placita 4.11; Mansfeld &\nRunia 2020: 1591). What complicates the attribution of a genetic\nempiricism to the Stoics is that they held that certain moral\nnotions\u2014ideas about what is just and good\u2014are acquired\n\u201cnaturally\u201d (phusik\u014ds; DL 7.53). In itself,\n\u201cnaturally\u201d could mean nothing more than arising\nspontaneously from experience, \u201cwithout attention or\nteaching\u201d (Scott 1995: 180\u201381). But in this context ideas\nthat are acquired \u201cnaturally\u201d are distinguished from those\nacquired \u201cby experience\u201d (kata peript\u014dsin),\nthat is to say, by way of sensation. This suggests something akin to\ninnate knowledge (Scott 1995: 203\u2013204).\n\nThere is, however, more than one way of thinking about innate\nknowledge. A claim to innate knowledge could mean that we are born\nwith certain ideas already implanted in our minds, or it could mean\nsimply that we have a disposition to form certain beliefs when\npresented with the right experience\n (sect. 2.2).\n Stoic innatism with regard to moral notions is better understood as\nthe second of these: a dispositional innatism. One way in which they\nexpressed this idea was to say that \u201cnature gives us uncorrupted\nstarting points\u201d (h\u0113 phusis aphormas did\u014dsin\nadiastrophous); it is external influences that lead human beings\nastray (DL 7:89). On this view, \u201cwe are naturally disposed to\nform certain patterns of behaviour\u201d (Scott 1995: 206). But in\norder to form the morally correct pattern of behaviour, we must be\npredisposed to form correct moral beliefs. One can argue that this\ndoes not violate the tenets of a genetic empiricism, since on the\nStoic view the mind is not entirely passive in forming ideas. Under\nthe influence of experience it \u201cinscribes for itself\u201d\n(enapographetai) certain notions on the blank sheet of\npapyrus (\u00c4etius, Placita 4.11; Mansfeld & Runia\n2020: 1591). It is consistent with such a view to say that the mind is\npredisposed to write one thing rather than another (Scott 1995:\n207\u20138).\n\nIn addition to this modified form of genetic empiricism, the Stoics\nalso embraced a justificatory empiricism, in which the presentation\n(phantasia) of a thing is the criterion by which the truth\nabout it is known (DL 7.49). But they held that not just any\npresentation can play the role of a criterion, only one that is\n\u201capprehensive\u201d (katal\u0113ptik\u0113; Annas\n1990: 189 n.18). An \u201capprehensive\u201d presentation is\n\u201cone caused by an existing object and imaged and stamped \u2026 in\naccordance with that existing object, of such a kind that it could not\nbe caused by a non-existent object\u201d (Sextus M VII\n1.248; see Reinhardt 2023: li\u2013lii). The question this raises is:\nhow do we know which presentations are \u201capprehensive\u201d (and\nthus a reliable criterion)? The Stoics had already recognized that an\napprehensive presentation required certain conditions to be in place,\nparticularly regarding the state of mind of the person who receives\nthe presentation (Annas 1990: 191). But it seems that under pressure\nfrom the Sceptics (Reinhardt 2023: xcix) the later Stoics suggested\nthat an apprehensive presentation was a necessary but not sufficient\ncriterion, since it was subject to a further condition. \u201cAn\napprehensive presentation\u201d, they argued, \u201cis the criterion\nof truth provided that it has no obstacle\u201d (Sextus M\nVII 1.253). An \u201cobstacle\u201d (enst\u0113ma) is some\nfact about the circumstances that makes a person reluctant to believe\nwhat the presentation suggests (Sextus M VII 1.254). If, for\ninstance, we were to see a person who was actually present, but we had\ngood reason to believe she was elsewhere, the proper move would be to\nwithhold assent (Reinhardt 2023: c n.288).\n\nWere the Stoics what I have called \u201cexplanatory\nempiricists\u201d, denying the legitimacy of inferences to unobserved\n(or, perhaps, unobservable) entities? A Stoic argument regarding\ndivination defends the practice on the grounds that we can observe the\nreliability of certain signs even if we cannot explain why they are\nreliable (Cicero Div. 1.12\u201316), a defence that reminds\none of the views of the medical empiricists (Allen 2001: 163). There\nis also evidence of Stoic caution about inferences to what is\n\u201cnot evident\u201d (ad\u0113lon). The Stoic thinker\nStrabo (ca. 64 BCE\u201324 CE remarks of Poseidonius (ca.\n135\u201351 BCE) that the latter\u2019s philosophy is too influenced\nby Aristotle in its \u201caetiologizing\u201d\n(aitiologikon), a practice that \u201cour school avoids\nbecause of the concealment of causes\u201d (dia t\u0113n\nepikrupsin t\u014dn aiti\u014dn) (Strabo Geog. 2.3.8).\nThis is consistent with a remark attributed to the leading Stoic\nthinker Chrysippus (ca. 280\u2013208 BCE). When discussing the\nlocation of the ruling part (h\u0113gemonikon) of the\nsoul\u2014a matter the Stoics regarded as \u201cnon-evident by\nnature\u201d (Tieleman 1996: 271)\u2014Chrysippus is reported to\nhave said that there are no \u201csure signs\u201d\n(tekm\u0113ria) from which one could infer a conclusion\n(Arnim SVF 2.887; Galen Op. 5, p. 268). This remark\nreflects Aristotle\u2019s usage of tekm\u0113rion to refer\nto a sign from which one can arrive at a necessary conclusion\n(Rhet. 1357b4\u20135). As we shall see in a moment,\nChrysippus did arrive at a conclusion, but his remark suggests a\ngreater caution about such inferences that we find in the more\nrationalist thinker, Galen (Allen 2001: 165).\n\nDespite this caution, the Stoics were not explanatory empiricists:\nthey went beyond what the medical empiricists would permit. Like the\nEpicureans, they allowed for inferences to what is \u201cnon-evident\nby nature\u201d, an idea that laid them open to attack from the\nSceptics. An example commonly attributed to the Stoics (although see\nSedley 1982: 241) is the inference from the observable fact of sweat\npassing through the skin to the existence of \u201cinvisible pores\n(no\u0113toi poroi)\u201d (Sextus PH 2.140). Some\nsuch inferences\u2014demonstrations (apodeixeis) in the\nstrict sense\u2014were based on rational insight into the nature of\nthings, a notion that resembles the Aristotelian ideal, to which the\nStoics seem to have become increasingly sympathetic (Allen 2001:\n178\u201379, 182). But on other occasions the Stoics appear to have\nbeen satisfied with evidence that was merely \u201cplausible\u201d\nor \u201cpersuasive\u201d (to pithanon), that is to say,\nevidence that \u201cleads us to assent\u201d, even though the\nconclusion may be false (DL 7.75). At least in some contexts, to\npithanon (the plausible) is synonymous with to eulogon\n(the reasonable) (Allen 2001: 166). Using the latter term, Philodemus\n(ca. 110\u201330 BCE) attributes to a Stoic\nphilosopher\u2014probably (pace Hankinson 2003: 79)\nDionysius of Cyrene (fl. ca. 150 BCE) (Allen 2001:\n207)\u2014 the idea that \u201cit is sufficient, concerning \u2026\nthings \u2026 which derive from experience, for us to be convinced\nin accordance with what is reasonable (kata t\u0113n\neulogian)\u201d (LS 42J). The example offered in this context is\nthat when we set sail in summer it is reasonable to believe we will\narrive safely.\n\nThere is, however, a debate regarding the role of merely plausible\nconsiderations in Stoic epistemology. A first view is that merely\nplausible considerations are sufficient to guide our action, although\nthey would not justify a claim to knowledge (Burnyeat 1982: 237). A\nsecond is that where certainty is unobtainable, merely plausible (in\nthe sense of probable) considerations can justify a claim to knowledge\n(Gould 1971: 135). A third is that we can start with what is merely\nplausible and through the clarification and mutual corroboration of\nsuch insights arrive at the apprehension (katal\u0113psis) of\na truth (Tieleman 1996: 284). (For a discussion of the role played by\nmutual corroboration in the Stoic conception of knowledge, see Annas\n1980: 101\u2013103.) Either the second of the third of these\ninterpretations would explain Chrysippus\u2019s willingness to argue\nthat the location of the ruling part of the soul is the heart, despite\nthe absence of \u201csure signs\u201d.\n3.3.4 Sceptics\n\nAs I suggested a moment ago, it was the Sceptics of the Pyrrhonian\nschool, as represented by the writings of Sextus Empiricus (ca.\n150\u2013225 CE), who most vigorously contested the Stoic view. The\naim of the Sceptics was not to achieve knowledge of the natural world,\nalthough Sextus\u2019s title empiricus suggests an\nassociation with the Hellenistic medical school of the same name.\nTheir aim was to attain \u201ctranquillity in matters of\nopinion\u201d (kata doxan ataraxia) (Sextus PH\n1.15). Nor could Pyrrhonian Sceptics have a theory of knowledge, for\nto have a theory of knowledge would entail holding beliefs, and their\naim (more radical than that of modern sceptics) was the suspension of\nbelief (Annas & Barnes 1985: 7). One might argue that Pyrrhonian\nScepticism was compatible with belief in a minimal sense of the word\n(Smith 2022: 289\u201392). But this seems to have meant nothing more\nthan \u201cgoing along with\u201d the impressions that are forced\nupon us (Sextus 2000: 61 n. 253) \u2013 even the sceptic can admit to\nfeeling cold (Sextus PH 1.13) \u2013 without any\n\u201cinclination towards\u201d (aneu prospatheias) what is\nbeing affirmed (Sextus PH 1.230).\n\nSextus does, at times, appear to endorse empiricist views. He remarks,\nfor instance, that \u201cif the senses cannot apprehend external\nobjects, neither can the mind\u201d (Sextus PH 1.99), since\nthe senses are the mind\u2019s \u201cguides\u201d\n(hod\u0113goi) (Sextus PH 1.128). This looks like a\nvariety of genetic empiricism, denying that the mind is\n\u201cinnately equipped with a set of concepts\u201d (Annas &\nBarnes 1985: 116). But not only would an empiricism of this kind\nentail holding a philosophical doctrine (which a Pyrrhonian Sceptic\nought to avoid), but Sextus\u2019s \u201cmodes\u201d\u2014his ways\nof inducing suspension of judgement\u2014have the general pattern of\ncontrasting appearances, showing that we have no reason to accept one\nrather than another (Annas & Barnes 1985: 25). So (pace\nSmith 2022: 260) it would be surprising if Sextus were here endorsing\nempiricism. He is more likely to be mentioning a view taken for\ngranted by his \u201cdogmatist\u201d opponents in order to undercut\ntheir beliefs, a practice that is common in his writings.\n\nAmong his criticisms of dogmatist views, Sextus includes a critique of\ninduction (epag\u014dg\u0113), which assumes that\nepag\u014dg\u0113 is simply a process of enumerative\ninduction. As we have already seen\n (sect. 3.2),\n this is unlikely to be what Aristotle understood by the term. But\ngiven this understanding of induction, Sextus is quick to point out\nits inadequacy. Those who follow this procedure must survey \u201call\nthe particulars or some of them.\u201d If they survey only some, the\ninduction will be insecure, since it may be that some of the omitted\nparticulars lack the feature in question. But if they try to survey\nall, \u201cthey will labour at an impossible task, since the\nparticulars are infinite and indefinite\u201d (Sextus PH\n2.204). The argument is not strictly sound, since there are cases in\nwhich we know (or believe we know) all the instances. An example that\nwould later be offered by John Buridan (1295\u20131358) is that of a\nproposition regarding all the (six) planets (SD 6.1.5). But\nif we set aside such instances, Sextus\u2019s challenge anticipates\nwhat would later be called \u201cthe problem of induction\u201d. The\nStoics had had a response to this challenge, which is that the world\nis governed by a divine reason, which guarantees its orderliness and\npredictability (Allen 2001: 165). But it was not a response likely to\nsatisfy a sceptic, ancient or modern.\n\nOn the face of it, the Sceptics\u2019 project of living without\nbelief seems impossible. One might argue, with David Hume, that\n\u201call human life must perish\u201d, if the principles of ancient\nscepticism were \u201cuniversally and steadily to prevail\u201d\n(Hume 1902: 160 [\u00a7128]). But Sextus\u2019s response to this\nproblem was remarkably close to that offered by Hume (Smith 2022:\n197), namely that we can (in practice) rely the observed association\nof particular kinds of events. The question here is whether this\nbroadly empiricist attitude is consistent with Pyrrhonian\nScepticism.\n\nA key distinction here is that which Sextus makes between two types of\nsign: the \u201ccommemorative\u201d or \u201crecollective\n(hypomyn\u0113stikon)\u201d and the \u201cindicative\n(endeiktikon)\u201d . An indicative sign is thought to\nsignify some reality that has not directly been observed. It does so\non account of what Sextus calls \u201cits proper nature and\nconstitution\u201d (Sextus PH 2.101). The idea here seems to\nbe that of a necessary connection between the sign and what it\nindicates, known by reason rather than by experience. The inference\nfrom movement to the possession of a soul, for example, makes use of\nan indicative sign, for the soul can never be directly observed. In\nSextus\u2019s view, inferences of this kind cannot be justified. (If\nSceptics were to allow themselves to hold a philosophical doctrine,\nthis would be an instance of explanatory empiricism.) Sextus is,\nhowever, happy to endorse the use of commemorative signs, which are\nbased on nothing more than the past experience of the association of\ntwo kinds of phenomena. Smoke, for instance, is a commemorative sign\nof fire; a scar is a commemorative sign that the bearer has received a\nwound (Sextus PH 2.102).\n\nOn the face of it, this looks inconsistent with Pyrrhonian Scepticism,\nsince it appears to involve holding a belief (such as \u201cthis is\nsmoke\u201d) and the making of an inference (such as \u201csmoke,\ntherefore fire\u201d). But Sextus suggests that neither belief (in\nthe sense of adherence to the truth of a proposition) nor inference\n(in the sense of a logical operation) is required. He argues that if\nreliance on commemorative signs did involve inferences, you would\nexpect those who had no knowledge of logic to be less skilled in the\nrelevant activities. But, as he writes, \u201cilliterate helmsmen and\nfarmers with no experience of dialectical principles are expert judges\nof signs\u201d (akr\u014ds s\u0113meiountai), being able to\npredict (in one case) a coming storm or calm weather and (in the\nother) a good or a poor harvest (Sextus M VII 2.270). Indeed,\neven non-human animals gain knowledge in this way. As Sextus writes,\n\u201cthe dog, when it tracks an animal by its footprints, is\nactually using signs\u201d (s\u0113meioutai), although it is\nnot making inferences. In Sextus\u2019s words, \u201cit does not\nformulate the judgement \u2018if this is a footprint, a beast is\nhere\u2019\u201d (Sextus M VII 2.271). One way of\nunderstanding this is to say that just as we cannot avoid \u201cgoing\nalong with\u201d certain sense impressions, so we cannot avoid being\ninfluenced by such observed correlations. If this deflationary\ninterpretation is correct, a reliance on commemorative signs would be\nconsistent with Sextus\u2019s scepticism.\n4. Medieval Empiricism\n\nIt is hardly surprising, given the influence of Christianity, that\nneither ancient Scepticism nor Epicureanism found much of a following\namong medieval thinkers. Stoicism was influential, but more for its\nmoral teachings than for its view of knowledge. However, the attitudes\nassociated with the medical empiricism of the Hellenistic age did not\nentirely disappear: we find at least hints of these among late\nmedieval writers. A striking example is the polemical work\nAntipocras by Nicholas of Poland (fl. 1278). While\nhimself an educated man, trained within the scholastic tradition and\nassocated with the medical school at Montpellier, Nicholas advocated a\nmedical practice based on experience, praising the knowledge of common\npeople over against that of the scholars. This may have been a\nreaction to the more theoretical style of medicine developing at\nMontpellier as a result of the discovery of works by Galen and some\nArab writers (Eamon & Keil 1987: 195). But for evidence of more\ngeneral empiricist doctrines, we must turn to the followers of\nAristotle.\n4.1 Varieties of Medieval Empiricism\n\nThe medieval followers of Aristotle shared his confidence in the\nreliability of the senses. Thomas Aquinas (1225\u20131274), for\nexample, follows Aristotle in holding that sensation is not deceived\nwith regard to its proper objects, such as colours and sounds\n(ST 1a 17.3), provided that the sense organs are functioning\nproperly and in the right circumstances (Pasnau 2002:\n188\u201389).\n\nDid medieval philosophers embrace a form of genetic empiricism? The\nLatin phrase characterizing an empiricism of this kind\u2014nihil\nest in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in sensu (nothing is in\nthe intellect that was not first in sensation)\u2014was something of\na commonplace. It is found (in variant forms) in the work of\nBonaventure (1221\u20131274), where it is attributed to Aristotle,\nAquinas, Matthew of Aquasparta (ca. 1240\u20131302), and Duns Scotus\n(1266\u20131308) (Cranefield 1970: 78\u201379). Not all accepted the\nidea, as we shall see, but Aristotelians generally took it for\ngranted. Aquinas follows Aristotle (DA 432a7\u20139) in\nholding that all the objects of our understanding \u201chave their\nbeing in the objects of perception,\u201d rather than in some\nseparated, Platonic realm. It follows that \u201cwithout sense\nperception no one can either learn anything new, nor understand\nmatters already learned.\u201d Even when we are thinking about\nsomething we already know, our thought is always accompanied by an\nimage (a \u201cphantasm\u201d), which is a likeness of something\nthat can be perceived (Aquinas In DA 3.13 [para. 791]).\n\nBut even when medieval writers speak of the mind as a tabula\nrasa, we should not attribute to them the kind of genetic\nempiricism later found in the work of John Locke. The blank tablet of\nwhich medievals speak, following Aristotle (DA 430a1), is\nwhat they called the \u201cpassive\u201d or \u201cpotential\u201d\nintellect, which was only one element in the process of cognition\n (sect. 4.3).\n When it comes to the larger picture, medieval philosophers sometimes\ncombine the Aristotelian idea that all knowledge comes through the\nsenses with an Augustinian view, which speak of divine illumination\n (sect. 4.2),\n or with the idea of innate knowledge. Even Aquinas held that we have\na kind of innate capacity, ultimately given by God, to grasp the first\nprinciples of scientific knowledge (Pasnau 2002: 307\u20138). This is\nprobably best thought of as a kind of a dispositional\ninnatism: we are disposed to form certain ideas when presented with\nthe right kind of experience.\n\nAt times Aquinas seems to go further. He writes, for instance, that\nour knowledge arises \u201cpartly from within and partly from\nwithout\u201d and that there is some truth in the idea that \u201cwe\nalready know that which we learn\u201d (Aquinas DV 10.6).\nOnce again, however, this looks like a dispositional innatism: the\nprinciples we employ in forming our beliefs are implicit in the\nstructure of the mind and its operations (Allers 1942: 58) (see\n sect. 4.3).\n Other writers are clearer in combining the tabula rasa idea\nwith a commitment to the idea of innate knowledge. Roger Bacon\n(1215\u20131292), for instance, suggests that the human soul is\ncreated with the species (aspects or forms) of all things\nwithin it, which reflects an Augustinian conception of knowledge. But\nsince the soul\u2019s union with the body hinders our access to this\nknowledge, the human mind (as potential intellect) can be described as\na \u201cblank slate\u201d (tabula nuda or rasa)\n(Bacon In Phys. pp. 7, 9; R. Wood 2007: 54). A similar view\nis found in the work of Robert Grosseteste (ca. 1165\u20131253), who\nalso combines a modified Augustinian belief in divine illumination\n (sect. 4.2)\n with the Aristotelian idea that we gain knowledge of scientific\nprinciples from experience (van Dyke 2009: 688\u201389).\n\nWhile these look like puzzling combinations of empiricist and\nnon-empiricist views, their rationale will become clear shortly\n (sect. 4.3).\n But alongside this qualified genetic empiricism, we also find\nexpressions of a justificatory empiricism. In particular, the work of\nRoger Bacon sets out two forms of justificatory empiricism, both of\nwhich fall under the heading of what he calls scientia\nexperimentalis. The first involves confirming well-founded\ndeliverances of reason by \u201ctrying them out,\u201d as it were,\nfor oneself (Hackett 2015: sect. 5.4.3). Bacon\u2019s rationale for\nurging this kind of testing is that arguments alone are insufficient\nto convince us of the truth of any practical matter.\n\u201cReasoning,\u201d he writes,\n\n\ndraws a conclusion and forces us to grant it, but it does not confirm\nit nor remove doubt so that the mind may rest in the knowledge of the\ntruth, unless this is found by way of experience. \u2026 For if a\nman \u2026 should prove by way of adequate arguments that fire burns\nand harms and destroys things, still the mind of the hearer would not\nrest on this account nor would such a person avoid fire before he had\nplaced his hand or some combustible material in fire, so that he might\ntest by experience [ut per experientiam probaret] what the\nargument had taught. (Bacon OM 6.1)\n\n\nIt follows (in a phrase for which Bacon has become famous) that\n\u201cwithout experience nothing can be sufficiently known\u201d\n(sine experientia nihil sufficienter sciri potest)\n(OM 6.1).\n\nA second form of justificatory empiricism holds that some beliefs can\nbe defended only by reference to experience, there being no\narguments from prior principles that can be adduced in their support.\nThese include, first of all, matters within the domain of the other\nsciences which mere reasoning could never have revealed, such as the\npractical discoveries made by alchemists (Bacon OM 6, 2a\nprae.). But there are also matters that fall outside the domain of any\nspeculative science, fields of inquiry in which scientia\nexperimentalis \u201cby its own power investigates the secrets\nof nature\u201d (Bacon OM 6, 3a prae.). To appreciate what\nthis kind of investigation entailed, we need to understand the class\nof phenomena to which it applied: that of the secrets of nature.\n\nThe domain of natural philosophy was \u201cthe common course of\nnature\u201d (Biard 2001: 79, 80): it dealt with what occurred (in\nAristotle\u2019s phrase) \u201ceither always or for the most\npart\u201d (\u0113 tou aei \u0113 tou h\u014ds epi to polu)\n(Met. 1027a21\u201322). But there existed phenomena that\nfell outside this domain, namely miracles and marvels. Miracles, in\nthe strict sense, were supernatural occurrences, which fell in the\ndomain of theology. But marvellous phenomena were often thought of as\n\u201cpreternatural,\u201d that is to say, as brought about by\noccult but natural properties and powers (Daston 1991: 95\u2013100).\nSuch powers included the influence exercised by the heavenly bodies on\nearthly affairs, as well as mysterious properties of sublunary\nentities, such as the lodestone. These powers were occult in the sense\nof being hidden. But they were also mysterious in that their workings\nwere not explicable in terms of what Aristotelians believed to be the\nfour simple substances (earth, air, fire, and water) and their\nassociated primary qualities (the hot and the cold, the moist and the\ndry) (Pasnau 2011: 44). It is for this reason that they could not be\nproved to exist by demonstrative arguments, but could be known only by\nexperience. This gave rise to a particular form of empiricism\nassociated with the study of \u201cnatural magic.\u201d\n\nAn example can be found in the work of an author already mentioned:\nNicholas of Poland, the radical medical empiricist of Montpellier. In\nhis Antipocras, Nicholas claims that although the presence of\na divinely given power in the most humble of objects cannot be proven\nby reason, it \u201cis made evident by its effect\u201d (hoc\npatet effectu) (Nicholas of Poland Ant. ll.\n202\u20133). In this respect Nicholas seems to have been influenced\nby another work more closely associated with magic, the De\nmirabilibus mundi. This states that there are \u201ccertain\neffects manifest to the senses to which we can assign no\nreason,\u201d as well as effects known only by way of reason. The\nmarvellous powers of natural objects belong to the former category,\nwhich are known by way of practical experience (per\nexperientiam) (Ps-Albertus PA-DM para. 49\u201350).\nWhile this work was falsely attributed to Albert the Great (ca.\n1200\u20131280), Albert himself adopts a similar line when defending\nthe mysterious powers of certain stones: these, too, are known\n\u201cmost convincingly by experience,\u201d although they lack a\nscientific explanation (A-DM 2.1.1).\n\nWhen medieval writers speak of knowing matters per\nexperientiam (by experience), they are understanding the term\nexperientia very broadly. The same may be said of the term\nexperimentalis, so that the phrase scientia\nexperimentalis should be translated as \u201cexperiential\nknowledge\u201d rather than \u201cexperimental science.\u201d\nAlthough Bacon\u2019s scientia experimentalis did include\npractical procedures (experimenta), as were used in alchemy,\nas well as the use of instruments (as in the study of optics and\nastronomy), it also included simple observation as well as reliance on\nsecond-hand reports of dubious value. (We are still a long way from\nthe motto of the seventeenth-century Royal Society: nullius in\nverba, \u201ctake no man\u2019s word for it.\u201d) Nor is\nthere any consistent link with quantification. In only a few fields,\nsuch as astronomy, are the procedures employed by natural philosophers\nassociated with careful measurement.\n\nIn the century following Bacon\u2019s work, we do find the\ndevelopment of what we may call \u201cquantified concepts,\u201d\nparticularly in the study of local motion. We find this, in\nparticular, in the work of the Oxford calculatores associated\nwith Merton College, who are perhaps best known for their formulation\nof the \u201cmean speed theorem.\u201d This was the idea that\n\n\na uniform acceleration produces the same \u2026 distance travelled\nin a given time, as a uniform velocity equal to the instantaneous\nvelocity at the middle instance of the time of acceleration. (Crombie\n1961: 153)\n\n\nBut while such developments mark a break with the Aristotelian\ntradition of a purely qualitative physics, they remain largely\ntheoretical. While the discussions giving rise to the mean speed\ntheorem emerged from everyday observations of falling bodies, the\ntheorem itself was proven arithmetically and geometrically (Clagett\n1959: 256, 259\u201360). The principles developed were not\n\u201coperationalized,\u201d that is to say, expressed in forms that\nwould allow for experimental testing (Clagett 1959: 206). Their\nexperimental testing had to await Galileo\u2019s inclined plane\nexperiments (Crombie 1961: 153\u201354).\n\nThis broad understanding of experience is evident, too, in medieval\nconceptions of the origin and scope of perceptual knowledge. With\nregard to the origins of such knowledge, later empiricists would focus\nalmost exclusively on the five \u201cexterior senses.\u201d But\nmedieval authors, following Avicenna (Ibn S\u012bn\u0101;\n980\u20131037), commonly list up to five \u201cinterior\nsenses\u201d (Bates 2010: 138\u201339) alongside the exterior ones.\nAquinas reduces these to four: the common sense, the imagination, the\nvis aestimativa (or cogitativa), and the sense\nmemory (Aquinas ST 1a 78.4). The work of these interior\nsenses involves an active role in shaping our perceptions, even those\nof our physical environment. The mind, in other words, is not entirely\npassive, even at its basic levels of operation. The vis\naestimativa, for instance, refers to the power that even\nnon-rational creatures have of making judgements about what is\ndangerous or useful: it shapes our perceptions by adding an evaluative\ncomponent.\n\nWith regard to the scope of experience, this was generally thought to\ninclude knowledge of our own interior acts. That we have some kind of\nimmediate access to such knowledge was \u201cone of the truisms of\nAugustinian thought\u201d (Leff 1975: 28). Its mechanism was\nunclear\u2014Scotus says simply that we know these things \u201cby\nway of a certain sense, that is, an interior perception\u201d\n(quodam sensu, id est, perceptione interiore) (Scotus\nOrd. IV d. 43, q. 2)\u2014but its existence was not in\ndoubt. As an anonymous scribe wrote in the margin of one of\nOckham\u2019s manuscripts, the idea that \u201cthere is nothing in\nthe intellect unless it was formerly in the [exterior] senses\u201d\napplies to \u201cexternal objects, not to its own acts\u201d (Leff\n1975: 28 n.116). In Bacon\u2019s work, this focus on inner experience\nis taken a step further, insofar as his conception of experience\nembraces not only our everyday mental states, but also spiritual\nstates up to and including \u201craptures\u201d in which people have\nvisions of things \u201cof which it is not lawful for human beings to\nspeak\u201d (Bacon OM 6.2). These are experiences brought\nabout by the grace of God, rather than any purely natural process of\ncognition.\n\nI have been arguing that medieval thought included a qualified form of\ngenetic empiricism (to which I shall return) and a distinctive form of\njustificatory empiricism, coupled with a broad understanding of\n\u201cexperience.\u201d What about explanatory empiricism? Insofar\nas medieval natural philosophy was influenced by Aristotle it shared\nhis view of scientific explanations. For the most part these did not\ninvoke unobservable entities that are distinct from the\nexplanandum, but generative powers that stem from very nature\nof the object being investigated\n (sect. 3.2).\n Medieval thinkers did not deny that we could know about unobservable\nentities. God, after all, was an unobservable entity, and thinkers\nsuch as Aquinas thought that \u201cnatural reason\u201d could know\nsomething about God, albeit by way of analogy. (William of Ockham [ca.\n1285\u20131347] would later downplay the extent of such knowledge,\nwithout dismissing it altogether [Leff 1975: 382\u201398].) But there\nwere limits to what we could know about the unobservable features of\nthe natural world (Hutchison 1982: 235\u201336). Aquinas, for\ninstance, appears to endorse Aristotle\u2019s view that when it comes\nto matters that are \u201cnot manifest to the senses\u201d\n(immanifesta sensui) we should not demand \u201ca certain\nand necessary demonstration\u201d; a merely possible explanation may\nbe the best we can achieve (Aquinas In Meteor. 1.7 [lect.\n11]). One could regard this as a very modest kind of explanatory\nempiricism.\n\nOne late medieval writer did embrace a stronger version of explanatory\nempiricism. This was Nicholas of Autrecourt (1299\u20131369).\nNicholas\u2019s central idea is that (outside of the articles of\nfaith) we can have certain knowledge only of propositions whose denial\nwould result in a contradiction. But since we can, without\ncontradiction, affirm the existence of something while denying the\nexistence of that which is thought to be its cause, we can have no\ncertain knowledge when it comes to causation. In a similar way, we\ncannot infer the existence of an underlying substance from appearances\nof things (Thijssen 1987: 243\u201344). More generally, Nicholas\nwrites, \u201cfrom the fact that something is known to be, it cannot\nbe inferred evidently \u2026 that there is some other thing\u201d\n(Letter to Bernard 2, \u00a711 [p. 65]). These observations amount to\na vigorous attack on the Aristotelian ideal of scientific\nunderstanding: the idea that we can (at least in principle) have\ncertain knowledge of the essences of things (Stiefel 1992: 299).\n\nNicholas remains an empiricist rather than a thorough-going sceptic,\nfor he believes that we cannot, without contradiction, deny what\nappears to be the case. I cannot, for example, affirm both that a\n\u201cwhite patch appears to me and that it does not appear to\nme\u201d (Copleston 1974: 253). The problem is that this certainty is\nlimited to appearances; it does not extend to the things themselves.\nTo escape from scepticism, Nicholas has to revert to merely probable\nknowledge. As he writes \u201cif we have any certainty about things,\nit is probable that everything that appears to be is (omne illud\nquod apparet esse sit), and that everything that appears to be\ntrue is true (omne illud quod apparet esse verum sit\nverum)\u201d (EO p. 228). This merely probable\nknowledge is itself conditional: it holds on the condition that\n\u201cwe have any certainty about things.\u201d What makes Nicholas\nconfident this condition is fulfilled is his firm conviction regarding\n\u201cthe goodness and purposiveness of things\u201d (Weinberg 1948:\n127), a view that reminds us of the Stoics\n (sect. 3.3.4\n Nicholas believes that \u201csince falsehood is an evil of the\nintellect, the complete goodness of the universe would have to be\ndenied if the human desire to know were eternally thwarted\u201d\n(Weinberg 1948: 193). But this principle of goodness is itself a\nmatter of merely probable knowledge (Weinberg 1948: 127\u201328).\n4.2 The Eclipse of Divine Illumination\n\nI have already noted a certain ambivalence among medievals writers\nregarding what I have called genetic empiricism, insofar as they\ncombine the idea of a \u2018blank slate\u2019 with that of an innate\ncapacity of the mind to form ideas. Some medievals, as we saw, went\nfurther, holding that the mind was incapable of attaining scientific\nknowledge without a divine illumination. It is time to look more\nclosely at this idea of divine illumination: the reasons why it was\nheld and its gradual decline.\n\nFollowers of St Augustine shared Plato\u2019s doubts about the\ncapacity of sense perception, in particular about its ability to give\nrise to scientific knowledge. Such knowledge, they held, did not arise\nfrom sense perception alone; it required a further input, provided by\nGod himself: a divine illumination. This can be a difficult idea for a\nmodern reader to grasp, since it is easily confused with another\nbelief, which has to do with a supernatural source of knowledge\naccessed by faith. The two are analogous, insofar as they both involve\na divine initiative. The act of faith requires a divine initiative\n\u201con the volitional side,\u201d to enable us to accept\npropositions as divinely revealed. The doctrine of divine illumination\nalso speaks of a divine initiative, but that initiative is directly\ncognitive rather than volitional (Pasnau 2015: sect. 1). It holds that\ndivine illumination is required for a number of apparently ordinary\ncognitive activities, which are engaged in by believers and\nnon-believers alike.\n\nWhile this doctrine has theological roots, it was also motivated by\ntwo features of human knowledge. The first has to do with those\nprinciples of thought that appear to be necessarily, not contingently,\ntrue. These include mathematical truths and principles such as that of\nnon-contradiction or sufficient reason. While such principles are\nessential to thought, it is difficult to see how they could be derived\nfrom sense perception. (Aristotle had provided an empiricist account\nof the origin of mathematical ideas\n [sect. 3.2],\n but this was, and remains, contested.) A second motivation was\nrelated to the Aristotelian ideal of science. Scientific understanding\n(epist\u0113m\u0113, or scientia), as we have seen,\ninvolved a grasp of the essential properties of perceived objects. But\nthis, too, involves a kind of insight that can seem to lie beyond the\ncapacity of the senses\n (sect. 3.2).\n Advocates of divine illumination argued that these kinds of knowledge\nwere possible only because the human mind has access to the mind of\nGod. More precisely, it was possible only because God bathed the human\nmind in his own, uncreated light. This allowed it not only to grasp\nnecessary truths, but to understand the essences of created beings by\nreference to their exemplars in the divine mind.\n\nThe development of medieval empiricism involved a rejection of this\ndoctrine. It is already opposed by Aquinas, who holds that that the\nhuman mind requires a special divine illumination only for those\nmatters that entirely exceed its natural powers, which are known by\ndivine revelation (Aquinas ST 1a 2ae 109.1). But the most\nvigorous rejection of the doctrine is to be found in the work of Duns\nScotus, who opposes the (modified) illuminationist teaching found in\nthe work of Henry of Ghent (ca. 1217\u20131293).\n\nHenry\u2019s version of the illuminationist doctrine was already\ninfluenced by Aristotelian thought (Marrone 1985: 145; 2011: 24),\nwhich in this context took the form of a desire to attribute as much\nas possible to the power of the human mind. But Henry was reluctant to\nattribute all we know to our unaided powers. In particular, he made a\ndistinction between knowing what is true (id quod verum est)\nabout an object and knowing its truth (eius veritatem). The\nfirst is a very basic level of knowledge, existing even in non-human\nanimals. It does grasp its object as a something distinct from the\nknower, but fails to grasp its essential characteristics. Such\nknowledge is not sufficient for science, which requires a grasp of\nwhat the object truly is (quid sit in rei veritate) (Henry of\nGhent Summa 1.2). The latter kind of knowledge requires\naccess to the exemplar of the object in the divine mind, something\nonly God can give.\n\nIt is this idea that Duns Scotus opposes. He would not, of course,\nhave opposed the idea that the human mind was created by God and thus\nowes all its powers to God. (Scotus was, after all, a theologian.) But\nhe did deny that scientific knowledge involved a special divine\nillumination. His argument proceeds in two stages. He insists, first\nof all, that Henry\u2019s restrictions on the powers of the human\nmind, rather than leading to scientific certainty, lead inevitably to\nscepticism. If the human mind is naturally incapable of grasping these\ntruths, then no amount of divine light will help it. He then argues\nthat there are four kinds of naturally attainable knowledge that give\nrise to the certainty required for science. There is, first of all,\nknowledge of \u201cmatters knowable in an unqualified sense,\u201d\nsuch as the fact that a triangle has three angles equal to two right\nangles. The second is knowledge of \u201cmatters knowable through\nexperience,\u201d such as that the moon is eclipsed. The third is\nknowledge of \u201cour own actions,\u201d such as the fact that I am\nawake. The fourth is knowledge of \u201cmatters we are currently\naware of through the senses,\u201d such as that the object in front\nof me is white (Scotus Ord. I dist. 3, pars 1, qu. 4,\nadnot.).\n\nPerhaps the most critical of these is knowledge through experience,\nfor it relates to the way we grasp the principles of scientific\nexplanation. Scotus\u2019s suggestion is that we can know these\nprinciples through repeated exposure to particular instances. As he\nwrites,\n\n\neven though a person does not experience every single individual, but\nonly a great many, nor does he experience them at all times, but only\nfrequently, still be knows infallibly that it is always this way and\nholds for all instances. He knows this in virtue of this proposition\nreposing in his soul: \u201cWhatever occurs in a great many instances\nby a cause that is not free, is the natural effect of that\ncause.\u201d (Scotus Ord. I dist. 3, pars 1, qu. 4)\n\n\nScotus seems to regard this proposition as self-evidently true. But as\nNicholas of Autrecourt would point out, it merely begs the question\n(Thijssen 1987: 249). In any case, Nicholas writes, if Scotus means by\na cause \u201cthat which brought an effect in a great many instances\nin the past and will do so in the future,\u201d then there is a\nproblem. For \u201ceven if something has brought about an effect in a\ngreat many instances, it is still not certain it will continue to do\nso\u201d (EO p. 237; Thijssen 1987: 249 n. 44). So we\ncannot, with certainty, form general statements on the basis of the\nkind of observations to which Scotus appeals. (This is, of course, the\nvery problem of induction to which Sextus Empiricus had referred\n [sect. 3.3.4].)\n Even if we could formulate such general statements, we could not be\ncertain that they embody causal claims. It is true that at least one\ncontemporary, John Buridan, would weaken the traditional Aristotelian\nidea that a scientific explanation should make its conclusion\nnecessary (Grant 2010: 237). But the issue Nicholas raised would\nremain a challenge to even Buridan\u2019s more relaxed ideal of\nscientific knowledge.\n\nWe shall come back to this question\n (sect. 4.3),\n which was made more pressing by the nominalism of Scotus\u2019s\nsuccessor, William of Ockham. But even if Scotus had no satisfactory\nalternative to the doctrine of divine illumination, that doctrine was\nsoon eclipsed. By the mid-fourteenth century, it seems to have been no\nlonger considered a viable option. While the idea did not entirely\ndisappear\u2014it re-emerges, for instance, in the work of Nicolas\nMalebranche (1638\u20131715)\u2014its rejection by late medieval\nthinkers marked an important step on the road to a more thorough-going\nempiricism.\n4.3 A Cognitive Empiricism\n\nI shall conclude this discussion by returning to the strong form of\ngenetic empiricism that I have called \u201ccognitive\nempiricism\u201d: the idea that the mind has no access to sources of\nknowledge that are independent of the senses. It is clear that\nadvocates of the doctrine of divine illumination would not count as\ncognitive empiricists. But what about those who rejected this\ndoctrine? One might question whether even they were cognitive\nempiricists, for the same reason one might ask this question of\nAristotle. While recognizing that all factual knowledge dervives from\nthe senses, they attributed to the mind a remarkable ability to grasp\nthe universals embedded in the singular objects of sense perception.\nWhat we see in the work of William of Ockham is a downgrading of this\npower, which goes hand-in-hand with a rethinking of the idea of\nuniversals. Ockham\u2019s work thus laid the foundations on which\nearly modern empiricists would build.\n\nThe power of the mind to grasp universals was traditionally attributed\nto what was called the \u201cagent intellect,\u201d the intellect as\nactive or productive. The idea of the agent (or active) intellect is\none of the most complex and contested aspects of medieval\nepistemology. It has its origins in some cryptic remarks made by\nAristotle (DA 430a10\u201319), in which he distinguishes\nbetween two aspects of the mind. There is the mind as \u201cthat\nwhich becomes all things\u201d (nous t\u014di panta\nginesthai) and there is the mind as \u201cthat which makes all\nthings\u201d (ho \u2026 t\u014di panta poiein). Behind\nthese descriptions is the idea that the mind \u201cbecomes\u201d the\nobject of its knowledge, in the sense of taking on its intelligible\nform without the matter in which it was originally embodied. The mind\nas passive\u2014as that which becomes all things\u2014stands in\nrelation to the mind that makes all things in the same way that prime\nmatter, which is pure potential, stands in relation to its shaping\nprinciple. Aristotle describes the mind as active or\nproductive\u2014the nous poi\u0113tikos, to use a phrase\ncoined by his commentators\u2014in terms that suggest something\nimmaterial: it is \u201cseparable, unmixed, and impassible.\u201d\nThis may be because it is not so much a substance, as an operation or\nfunction; indeed Aristotle describes the nous poi\u0113tikos\nas \u201cby nature activity\u201d (t\u0113i ousiai \u2026\nenergeia).\n\nAs that last interpretive remark suggests, this passage demands\ncommentary and commentators disagreed about how it was to be\nunderstood. (For a classic survey, see Brentano 1992.) Broadly\nspeaking, there were two views. The first held that the agent\nintellect was separate from each human mind, such that the\nintelligible forms \u201cflow\u201d from this immaterial entity into\nthe mind to produce an act of understanding. This was the view held,\nin two quite different forms, by Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (Avicenna) and Ibn\nRushd (Averro\u00ebs) (1126\u20131198). Such a view implies that\nthere is only one agent intellect, common to all human beings, which\nmay or may not be identified with God himself. (When it is identified\nwith God, this view closely resembles the Augustinian doctrine of\ndivine illumination.) The alternative idea, vigorously defended by\nAquinas, held that both the agent intellect and the potential\nintellect are aspects of the human mind. Even among those who held\nthat latter view, there were different ways in which the agent\nintellect was thought to produce knowledge. In some versions of the\ndoctrine (such as Aquinas\u2019s) the agent intellect was thought to\nabstract the intelligible forms from the images produced by the\nsenses. In other versions, the input of the senses was little more\nthan the occasion on which the agent intellect drew on its own innate\nresources, in the process of which the mind could be thought of as\nenlightened by God. Thomas of York (d. ca. 1260), for instance spoke\nopenly in this context of innate ideas and of a knowledge that came\n\u201cfrom above and not from the senses\u201d (Bowman 1973:\n265).\n\nThe second of these views, in particular, seems incompatible with both\na tabula rasa and a cognitive empiricism. So it is not\nsurprising that the development of a more thoroughgoing cognitive\nempiricism went hand-in-hand with with an effective abandonment of the\nidea of the agent intellect.\n\nThe work of the agent intellect had seemed essential because of a\nwidely held view regarding the object of knowledge. This held that\nwhile the senses deal with particular individuals, the intellect can\ngrasp only their universal properties. As Aquinas writes, citing\nAristotle (APo. 87b37\u201339), \u201csense has to do with\nparticulars, whereas intellect has to do with universals\u201d\n(sensus particularium, intellectus \u2026 universalium)\n(Aquinas In DA 2.5 [sect. 284]). (The idea that the intellect\nhas direct knowledge only of universals seems distinctively\nAristotelian; it was not shared by other ancient philosophical schools\n[Normore 2007: 114].) Aquinas\u2019s reason for holding this view is\nthat the intellect, as an immaterial substance, cannot directly grasp\nmaterial singulars. Intellectual knowledge therefore requires the work\nof the agent intellect, abstracting the immaterial intelligible forms\nfrom the perceptible forms grasped by the senses. We do, of course,\nknow singular objects, for all the objects of sensation are,\nultimately, singulars. But in Aquinas\u2019s view, the intellect\nknows these objects only indirectly, by directing its attention back\nto the images yielded by the senses and linking these with the\nassociated general concept (Aquinas ST 1a 86.1).\n\nWilliam of Ockham, on the other hand, holds what Aquinas expressly\ndenies: that \u201cthe singular object is that which is first known,\nin a manner simple and proper to itself\u201d (Ockham Quodl.\nI qu. 13). He holds, too, that the immateriality of the intellect is\nno barrier to this, since the relation involved is a merely\nintentional one (Ockham Ord. I dist. 3, qu. 6; In\nPhys. 1.1 [sect. 2]). Ockham, however, goes further in denying\nthe very existence of universals. All Aristotelians, of course, denied\nthat universals exist extra rem (distinct from singular\nobjects). But Christian Aristotelians such as Aquinas continued to\nregard the similarities between individuals of a given kind as the\nproduct of a common idea, which existed ante rem (before the\nexistence of particular objects) in the mind of God (Aquinas\nST 1a 15.2). As aspects of the divine mind, these were\nthought to share in the divine nature. Indeed they were nothing less\nthan \u201cthe divine essence as imitable outside itself\u201d\n(Klocker 1980: 357). This gave the natural kinds discoverable by\nscience a metaphysical grounding. While paying lip service to the\nAugustinian notion of ideas in the divine mind, Ockham reduced these\nto the ideas God has of individual objects in the act of creating\nthem. These ideas refer, in the first instance, to the creatures\nthemselves: the only reason for positing them is that when God creates\nhe knows what he is doing (Deus est rationabiliter operans)\n(Ockham Ord. I dist. 35, qu. 5). It follows, as Ockham\nwrites, that\n\n\nno universal \u2026 exists in any way outside the mind and anything\nthat can be predicated of many is by its nature in the mind either\npsychologically [subiective] or logically\n[obiective], and \u2026 no universal is of the essence or\nnature [de essentia seu quidditate] of any substance. (Ockham\nOrd. I dist. 2, qu. 8)\n\n\nThis means that the features that unite entities of a kind, which are\nexpressed in the general propositions of science, no longer have a\nmetaphysical foundation. While this view is generally described as\n\u201cnominalist,\u201d it is more accurately characterized as\n\u201cconceptualist,\u201d since the \u201cnames\u201d to which\nuniversals were reduced were nomina mentalia (mental names),\nor (as we would say) concepts (Maurer 1999: 63\u201364). But with\nthis qualification in mind, I shall continue to refer to it as\n\u201cnominalist.\u201d\n\nWhat implications does this have for the idea of the agent intellect?\nDespite his nominalism, Ockham continues to believe that there are\nreal similarities lying behind our classificatory schemes, rejecting\nthe idea that these are entirely matters of convention (Ockham\nOrd. I dist. 2 qu. 8). But although real similarities exist,\nthey are not expressions of common essences or natures. Coupled with\nthe idea that the mind has an immediate grasp of singular objects, it\nfollows that a special faculty was not longer required in order to\nabstract the universal from the particular. It was enough for the mind\nto be able to identify similarities among particular individuals.\n(Note that the status of these similarities then became a problem,\nwhich Ockham may never satisfactorily have resolved [Goddu 1984:\n92\u201393].) So it comes as no surprise to discover that Ockham\ndenies any real distinction between the agent intellect and the\npotential intellect. \u201cThe same intellect,\u201d he writes,\nsimply \u201chas different names\u201d (Ockham Ord. I dist.\n3, qu. 6). Since there was now no distinctive task for the agent\nintellect to perform, Ockham could wield his famous razor to abandon\nthe idea that it represented a distinct power of the mind (Ockham\nRep. II qu. 20).\n\nThere is another dimension to the empiricism of this period, which is\na new emphasis on experience as a means of discovering causal\nrelations. Any Aristotelian, of course, would have agreed that we know\nof causal relations by means of experience. But what we find in the\nwork of Scotus and Ockham is a particular focus on this idea, coupled\nwith descriptions of how one may isolate particular causes. Historians\nhave long associated this with a renewed emphasis on God\u2019s\nabsolute power and the idea that the order of the world depends\nentirely on his will, which makes that order radically contingent and\ndiscoverable only a posteriori (Foster 1934: 464\u201365;\nHenry 2009: 88). It is, however, difficult to find a contemporary\nexpression of this idea and it has recently been contested (Harrison\n2002: 63\u201364). Nor should one overstate the degree of novelty in\nthe thought of Scotus and Ockham. Grosseteste had already outlined the\nidea of a controlled experiment (Lewis 2013: sect. 11), which itself\nhad been anticipated in the work of Galen\n (sect. 3.3.1).\n Interestingly, Grosseteste\u2019s example had also been a medical\none: he notes that we can come to know that scammony (convulvulus\nscammonia) purges red bile by administering it \u201cafter all\nother causes purging red bile have been isolated and excluded\u201d\n(Grosseteste In APo. 1.15; Crombie 1953: 74). It is true,\nhowever, that more detailed accounts of how to isolate causal\nrelations are found only in the late thirteenth and fourteenth\ncenturies. Scotus outlined several such methods (Vos 2006:\n312\u201319), all of which involved separating out possible causes\nand testing them by seeing in which cases the effect follows. At one\npoint, for example, Scotus writes:\n\n\nHow, from perceptible effects, does one arrive at knowledge of the\ncause? I respond, by dividing thus: in [a situation of type] A are\npresent [factors] B, C, D, if you wish to know which of D, B, or C is\na cause, consider the case where you find B without C. If then D\nfollows B and not C, then in [a situation of type] A, B is the cause\nof D. (Scotus In Met. I qu. 4)\n\n\nOckham picks up on this idea. He does not deny that we can know of\nsome causes by simple reasoning, on the basis of self-evident or\nwell-established metaphysical principles. We can know, for instance,\nthat the will causes its own acts (Ockham Ord. I dist. 1, qu.\n3) or that there exists a first conserving cause of this world (Ockham\nOrd. I dist. 2, qu. 10]). But when it comes to the discovery\nof causes within the natural world, we must rely on observation. If a\ncausal agent is of a very specific kind (in Ockham\u2019s terms,\nknown by way of its species specialissima), just one\nobservation will suffice. A single observation of a particular kind of\nherb curing a particular illness, for example, can safely be\ngeneralized. It can be generalized on the basis of the principle that\n\u201call agents of the most specific kind will bring about effects\nof the same nature\u201d (Ockham Ord. I prol. qu. 2). If the\nsuspected cause is of a more generic kind, then many instances will be\nneeded (Ockham Ord. I prol. qu. 2). But in either case, the\nprocess is thoroughly empirical: it involves the isolation of causal\nfactors by way of experience. As Ockham writes,\n\n\nalthough I do not intend to make any general claim about the nature of\nimmediate [secondary] causes, I shall say what suffices for something\nto be an immediate cause, namely that when it is present there occurs\nthe effect, and when it is not present \u2026 the effect does not\noccur. And everything that has this character with respect to another\nis the cause of that other \u2026 That this is sufficient for one\nthing to be the cause of another, seems manifest. Because if not,\nthere remains no way of knowing something to be the cause of something\nelse. (Ockham Ord. I dist. 45, qu. 1)\n\n\nIt is tempting to see this as a reduction of the idea of causation to\nthat of the regular association of kinds of events. One could even\nargue that such a view would be a logical consequence of Ockham\u2019s\nnominalism (Klocker 1980: 351). But Ockham\u2019s point here seems to\nbe epistemological, not metaphysical: this is how we discover a cause\n(Adams 1979: 23). It follows that the only kind of cause we can\ndiscover is that which produces a novel (and therefore observable)\neffect. Without such an effect, there would (once again) be no way of\nknowing something to be a cause (Ockham Sum. II 3). Coupled\nwith the effective abandonment of the idea of the agent intellect,\nthis brings us very close to a thoroughgoing cognitive empiricism.\n5. Conclusion\n\nThose sympathetic to empiricism may be inclined to portray this\nhistory as a progress from darkness to light. But a moment\u2019s\nreflection suggests it deserves a more cautious evaluation. These\nancient and medieval thinkers certainly laid the foundations on which\nearly modern and modern empiricists would build. But they also\nbequeathed a series of problems, some of which have never been\nsatisfactorily resolved.\n\nThere are, first of all, the problems faced by the Epicureans, who\nwere genetic but not explanatory empiricists, favouring the atomist\ntheory of Leucippus and Democritus. As Democritus seems to have\nrealized, while the atomist doctrine can be supported by observable\nfacts (such as the fact of motion), once formulated it seems to\nundercut a belief in the reliability of such observations. At the very\nleast, it suggests a distinction between what would later be called\n\u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d qualities, narrowing\nthe range of the kind of experiences to which natural philosophers\nwould appeal.\n\nThe Epicureans also seem to have come up against another enduring\nproblem: that of the underdetermination of theory by data. If the\nsenses cannot directly \u201cbear witness\u201d to the existence of\nwhat cannot be observed, being able only to bear witness against it,\nthere may be a number of apparently equally acceptable hypotheses\nabout the unobservable. One could argue, as Epicureans seem to have\ndone, that these should all be regarded as true, in the sense of being\nrealized somewhere and at some time. But this seems unsatisfactory\nwhen it comes to explaining particular events.\n\nMore broadly, there is the problem of just what experience can show.\nCan experience be a source of mathematical or logical knowledge? Can\nit reveal the causal relations that are traditionally regarded as the\ngoal of science? Aristotle, as we saw, seems to have held that the\nmind has the power of identifying the causal powers that belong to\nparticular kinds of entities. But it was never clear that experience\nalone could achieve such an insight. Medieval discussions of the\n\u201cagent intellect\u201d tended to regard it as an external\npower, or, at least, a human faculty that participates in a divine\nlight. Thinkers such as Henry of Ghent went further, embracing the\nAugustinian idea that an act of divine illumination is required on\neach occasion we attain such insights. Under the impact of\nAristotelian naturalism this idea was abandoned, but without (it must\nbe said) any clear alternative.\n\nLater empiricists could (and did) follow Ockham in denying that there\nare universals to be discovered; they professed to be undisturbed by\nthe fact that we cannot grasp the \u201creal essences\u201d of the\nobjects we perceive (Locke Essay 3.6.9). But the problems of\nempiricism did not go away. Even one of the empiricist\u2019s\nfavorite ideas\u2014the \u201ccovering law\u201d account of\nscientific explanation\u2014assumes we can arrive at true\ngeneralizations, propositions that apply to all members of a\nparticular class. But for those who take Ockham\u2019s nominalism to\nits logical conclusion, a law of nature can be nothing more than a\ncontingently true proposition. Since the similarities that fix class\nmembership have no metaphysical grounding, not being based on a shared\nnature, we cannot know the truth of the law by any kind of rational\ninsight. The only way of testing such a proposition is by observation.\nIt is at this point that there arises the \u201cproblem of\ninduction,\u201d first discussed by Sextus Empiricus and picked up by\nNicholas of Autrecourt, but made famous in the eighteenth century by\nDavid Hume.\n\nIn our own time, the wheel has turned. On the one hand, talk of\n\u201cessences\u201d and necessary truths has become fashionable\nagain, at least in some circles (Haldane 2018). In particular, if we\nwant to distinguish laws of nature from accidental generalizations,\ncontingently true propositions do not seem sufficient for science.\nLaws of nature on this view must embody modal knowledge, particularly\nas this relates to contrary-to-fact conditionals (Armstrong 1978:\n274). This brings us back to Aristotle, for his conception of\nscientific knowledge (epist\u0113m\u0113) involved knowing\nthat given a posited cause, the fact to be explained cannot be\notherwise (APo. 71b11). The problem for the empiricist is:\nHow can sense perception yield modal knowledge of this kind? On the\nother hand, William of Ockham\u2019s nominalism can be thought to\nanticipate the work of contemporary thinkers who would \u201clower\nthe bar\u201d (as it were), no longer demanding that we gain\nknowledge of what is necessarily the case. Taken to its logical\nconclusion, Ockham\u2019s view can be thought to hold that the\n\u201cuniversals\u201d that were the goal of Aristotelian science\nare no more than \u201csets of competencies in classifying things\ntogether\u201d, which have no grounding outside the practices in\nwhich we engage (King 2003: 225). (For a less sceptical reading of\nOckham, see Colvert 2000: 265.) Is a radical nominalism of this kind\ntenable? The question has not yet been answered.\n\nThis article began with the observation that we should not approach\nancient thinkers in a \u201cWhiggish\u201d fashion; nor should we\nforce their thought into modern categories. But what this history\nshows is that there is no need to do so. Once we understand what these\nthinkers were saying, we can see that we are still grappling with the\nissues they raised.\n",
