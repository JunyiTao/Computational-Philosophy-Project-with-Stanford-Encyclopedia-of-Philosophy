    "main_text": "The created order\n4. The created order\n\nThese difficulties, as Origen perceived, had not been fully resolved\nby the argument that since the world is coeval with time we need not\nask what God was doing before he created it (see further Tzamalikos\n2006: 179\u2013271). From Genesis 1.1 we learn that God created the\nworld in the beginning, and from John 1.1 that the Logos was with him\nin the beginning; but as we are also told that God created all things\nin wisdom, Origen takes this beginning to be not a temporal origin but\nthe eternal desideratum of existence who is also the second person of\nthe Trinity (CommJohn 1.39.289). It follows, however, that if\nthis temporal world is the only one, an infinite cause has exhausted\nitself in a finite effect. Perhaps it was in the hope of evading this\nparadox that Origen interpreted Solomon\u2019s dictum, \u201cthere\nis nothing new under the sun\u201d (Ecclesiastes 1.10) to mean that\nworlds have existed before the present one (Princ. 3.1.6).\nThis manoeuvre, however, will bring no escape unless one posits an\ninfinite succession of worlds before and after the present one, and\neven Origen\u2019s enemies do not say that he went so far. An endless\nseries, after all, would be sempiternal rather than eternal, and the\nStoics might have replied that their belief in the perpetual\nreduplication of the same cosmos\u2014a belief disowned by\nOrigen (Cels. 4. 68)\u2014comes closer to matching timeless\nactivity with a timeless product. A better solution than either of\nthese, in Origen\u2019s view, was to posit a noetic realm, created\nbut eternal, populated by logika, or rational entities, under\nthe hegemony of the logos, and preceding ours in the ontological\nhierarchy rather than in the temporal continuum (Princ.\n2.9.4). Evidence for this conceit could be found in the creation of a\nheaven and earth at Genesis 1.1 before the creation of the visible\nfirmament (Genesis Homilies 1.5). To the modern mind this is\nforced exegesis, representing the triumph of philosophy over\nphilology; the philosophy, however, is not that of any Greek school,\nbut of a Christian who has set himself a conundrum by his fidelity to\nMoses. It is a striking observation, however we explain it, that the\nforms of particular things which coexist in the mind of Origen\u2019s\nGod with the genera and species are not attested in any pagan\nPlatonist before Plotinus, his younger contemporary and (as most\nbelieve) a fellow-pupil of Ammonius Saccas (cf. Plotinus,\nEnneads 5.7).\n\nAs the absolute and transcendent dunamis of the Father\n(Cels. 1.66; CommJohn 1.18.107 etc.), the second\nperson is properly the lord of every dunamis in heaven and\nearth (Cels. 5.45). At the same time, it can be said that he\nis the food of the celestial dunameis who have remained true\nto the Creator, while Satan is the food of those who have fallen\n(On Prayer 27.12). It is the angelic dunameis who\nkeep watch over his cradle at the time of his nativity (Cels.\n1.61), and who sometimes form a retinue at the scenes where he\nperforms those works of power which we call miracles\n(CommJohn 2.4.40). This polysemic usage of the term, which\nmirrors that of the New Testament, presents no difficulty so long as\nevery other dunamis is conceived as a lower or local\nmanifestation of the undivided power which appertains to him as Logos.\nAs we have seen, this term defines his hegemonic relation to the\ncreated order; Wisdom is another of his biblical appellations, yet\nthis Wisdom is the beginning in which the Logos was with God\n(CommJohn 1.39.289; see further Tzamalikos 2006:\n119\u2013178). However one accounts for these obscurities, it seems\nunlikely that Origen could have signed the Nicene Creed of 325, in\nwhich the Son is declared to be from the ousia of the Father,\nand therefore homoousios (of one essence, substance or\nnature) with him (cf. CommJohn 20.18.157). A community of\nnature between the two is asserted, however, at CommJohn\n2.10.76); and in his Commentary on Hebrews, he deduces from\nWisdom 7.26, where Wisdom is styled an aporroia or emanation\nof the Father, that the relation between the two persons of the\nTrinity is analogous to that which holds between an ointment and the\nexhalation which is homoousios with it (Pamphilus,\nApology 99\u2013104; see Edwards 1998). Thus he can make\noblique use of a term which he cannot predicate directly of\nincorporeals; Plotinus, who could have done so, could not have said\nthat nous was homoousios with the One because the\nlatter is superior to ousia.which can be posited only at the\nlevel of nous. \n\nAlthough the Son is not \u201cfrom the ousia\u201d of the\nFather, he is said in the Latin translation of Origen\u2019s\nCommentary on Hebrews to be ex substantia patris,\nfrom the hypostasis of the Father. That hypostasis,\nnot ousia, was the original noun in Greek can be deduced from\nthe text of Hebrews 1.3, where the Son is described as an impression\nof his [the Father\u2019s] hypostasis. Here\nhypostasis appears to signify the reality disclosed by a\nphenomenon; the formula ex substantia patris was already\naxiomatic for Origen\u2019s African contemporary Tertullian\n(Against Praxeas 7.9). In Latin of this period\nsubstantia was used indifferently to represent both\nhypostasis and ousia; these Greek terms are not\nexplicitly distinguished in Origen\u2019s writings, though he\nrefrains from attributing either one ousia or three to the\nGodhead. Some difference in concreteness is implied by his strictures\non those who fail to qualify the ousia of the Son and thus\ndeny him a hypostasis altogether (CommJoh 1.24.152):\nit seems, then that the hypostasis is a specific\ndetermination of the more generic ousia. Origen stipulates in\nhis treatise On Prayer (15.1) that the Son should not receive\nthe prayer of adoration which is offered to the Father because he\ndiffers from the Father in ousia and in substrate\n(hupokeimenon); the latter word is best understood with\nreference to the body that he assumed in the incarnation, and we\ncannot therefore be sure whether the ousia of which Origen\nspeaks is that of the exalted Christ in his eternal or his human\ncharacter. It is generally true that he takes fewer pains than later\nChristian authors to winnow what is said of the Son as second person\nof the Trinity from what is said of him as Jesus of Nazareth. When he\ncompares the Father to a statue of infinite magnitude and the Son to a\nsmaller statue accommodated to our perceptions, he begins as though\nthe visible were a metaphor for the invisible, but ends by quoting\nPhilippians 2.7 on the manifestation of Christ in the form of a slave\n(Princ. 1.2.6).\n\nOrigen strongly affirms the ontological dependence of the Spirit, or\nthird hypostasis of the Trinity, on the second. To say otherwise would\nbe to deny that he was brought into being, since the author of all\nthat was brought into being, according to John 1.3, is the Son or\nLogos. It would be truer, however, to say that the Spirit did not come\ninto being without the Son than that he came into being through him\n(CommJohn 2.12.17\u201319). The Spirit, as\nhypostasis, is not only eternal but incorporeal in the\nstrictest sense: this follows from First Principles 1.6.4,\nwhere Origen finds it impossible to imagine that any being apart from\nthe members of the Trinity can subsist without a body. If these\npersons were incorporeal only in the looser sense that Origen\nrecognises in First Principles, proem 10, he could not have\ndrawn such an antithesis between the Godhead and the angelic creation.\nThe powers and operations of the Spirit are not so clearly delineated\nin his writings, as those of the other two persons; the same could be\nsaid of almost any writer before Nicaea, and the cause, no doubt, is\nthe absence of unanimity in the scriptures. It is the Spirit who moves\n(or broods) on the face of the waters before creation at Genesis 1.2;\nat John 1.3 the Logos supplants the Spirit, which is now said at John\n7.39 to have been given only when Jesus was glorified at the end of\nhis ministry. Origen follows John when he writes that the Father is at\nwork in the entire creation, the Son in those beings who possess\nlogos or reason, and the Spirit in the elect (Justinian,\nTo Menas; cf. Princ. 1.3.5). It may be that this\nrestriction of the Son\u2019s office implies a Greek rather than a\nbiblical understanding of the term logos, but Greek thought\nknows of no supernal being who acts in the realm assigned by Origen to\nthe Spirit (pace Dillon 1982). This Trinitarian hierarchy has\nbeen compared with that of the noetic principles being, life and mind\nin the system of Proclus, for whom being encompasses all that exists,\nlife the more limited sphere of living creatures and mind the still\nmore limited sphere of the rational. The correspondence, however, is\nfar from exact, and, as Proclus wrote two centuries after Origen and\nunder later influences, more compelling arguments will be required\nbefore we assign to a Platonic source the doctrine that Origen draws\nso effortlessly from the scriptures. No evidence has been produced to\nshow that the Spirit functions in Origen as the soul of the world; he\nsurmises on one occasion that the Logos is the soul of God\n(Princ. 2.8.5), but only because he needs to account for an\nanthropomorphic metaphor at Psalm 84.6. .\n\nThat the Godhead is incorporeal\u2014and therefore, in Origen\u2019s\nlexicon, immaterial\u2014is, as we have seen, an unassailable premiss\nof his theology. If the second person has any substrate\u2014any\nmatter, as we might say\u2014it is the will of God the Father. The\nsignificance of this doctrine becomes apparent when we recall that\nChrist is wisdom and that in the myth attributed to the Gnostic\nPtolemaeus, the error of wisdom lies in her acting without the assent\nof her consort Thelema, or Will (Irenaeus, Against Heresies\n1.1\u20134). The Father\u2019s will, on the other hand, is not the\nsubstrate but the cause of the material universe, which Origen held,\nwith every orthodox Christian of his day, to have been created out of\nnothing. For most Christians this did not entail that God creates\nwithout matter, but that the matter from which he shaped the world was\nthe first of his creations. Matter had seldom been defined in\nChristian prose before Origen, but for him, as for Aristotle, as he\nhas often been interpreted, it is the unqualified receptacle of all\nqualities, a mere potentiality for existence in contradistinction to\nessence, of which nothing can be predicated until it is actualised as\ndeterminate being. But then follows Bishop Berkeley\u2019s question:\nif matter is not something, why not conclude that it is nothing?\nOrigen is perhaps the first extant writer who informs us that this\nquestion had been posed in his time, though in his accustomed manner\nhe neither affirms it at First Principles 4.4.7 nor names its\nproponents. We must say \u201cperhaps\u201d, because the\nPhilokalia, a florilegium of his writings, contains a short\ndialogue in which the redundancy of matter is established by Socratic\ninterrogation (Philokalia 24). In view of his diffidence in\nFirst Principles, it seems more likely that this text is the\nwork of Maximus, a second-century author to whom it is also attributed\nin our manuscripts.\n5. Theodicy and sin\n\nIt is clear at least that Origen\u2019s God creates the world from\nnothing and without toil or opposition (Princ. 2.1.5).\nBecause he asserts that such a world will inevitably be finite, as God\nhimself cannot comprehend the infinite, Origen was later accused of\nslighting the omnipotence of the Creator. His meaning, however, is not\nthat there are limits to the power of God, but that any particular\nexercise of it must logically have some limit. The infinite is by\nnature incomprehensible; hence it is no shortcoming in God that he\ncannot comprehend it, and he remains omnipotent in the sense that\nthere is no finite enterprise that lies beyond his power. In contrast\nto the Gnostics, therefore, who held that our world is the residue of\na rupture or fall within the Godhead, Origen maintains that a single\nGod is the creator of both the intellectual and the material cosmos.\nHe also purports to demonstrate the priority of the intellectual Adam\nto the material Adam, first by giving an allegorical sense to the\nfirmament which divides the waters at Genesis 1.7, then by a literal\nreading of Genesis 1.26\u20132.22. In this text the creation of\nhumanity as male and female in the image of God, as the crown of his\nhandiwork, is succeeded by a narrative of quite a different tenor, in\nwhich God fashions the body of the first man from the soil and then,\nafter populating the garden with beasts and plants and infusing the\nspirit into his nostrils, derives the body of the first woman from his\nrib (Genesis 2.1\u20137; 2.21\u201325). It is not clear whether a\ntemporal, as well as an ontological, priority is accorded to the inner\nman, or whether the protoplasts owe their creation to his fall.\n\nThat the denizens of the present world have sinned, and will sin\nagain, is a ubiquitous premiss of Origen\u2019s theodicy.\nMisadventures which the world ascribes to fortune, fate or the malice\nof our superhuman guardians will always in fact be trials of virtue,\nchastisements for sin (perhaps forgotten) or correctives to hidden\ninjustice. Thus if we cannot divine (for example) why God loved Jacob\nand hated Esau\u2014the explanation must lie in causes prior to the\nbirth of either (First Principles 2.9.7). Origen may have been aware\nof Jewish speculations that Esau offended God in the womb, but it is\nusually assumed that when he speaks of a \u201cformer life\u201d in\nwhich Esau sinned he alludes to a previous embodiment or to a\ndisembodied state. Perhaps this is why his detractors in late\nantiquity ascribed to him the doctrine that all rational beings were\nonce pure intellects in the presence of God, and would have remained\nso for ever had they not fallen away through koros or\nsatiety. Each of the delinquents, we are told, received a body\ncorresponding to the gravity of the original sin: those who fell least\nbecame angels, those who fell most became demons, and human souls\nconstitute order in keeping with the mediocrity of their\ntransgressions (Antipater of Bostra at Patrologia Graeca\n96.504\u2013505). This account of Origen\u2019s teaching was already\nknown to Augustine, who perceived its incoherence, since it implies\nthat the bodies of demons, who inhabit the air above us, are grosser\nthan ours. In the form that is now canonical, it is a bricolage of\nPlatonic myths recounting the fall of the soul from the\n\u201csupercelestial place\u201d, the peculiarly Christian and\nanti-Platonic concept of the demons as fallen angels, and\nPhilo\u2019s opinion that koros is the cause of the\nsoul\u2019s estrangement from its maker (Heir of Divine\nThings 240). If Origen held such a theory, it was not on the\nPlatonic ground that soul, as the cause of motion, cannot be brought\ninto being and hence must be immortal; his object, typically\nChristian, is to vindicate biblical teaching and at the same time to\nshow that it cannot be used to support any Gnostic or pagan\nanimadversion on divine justice (Martens 2015). Accordingly (though\nsome of his ancient critics pretended otherwise), his writings are\nunequivocal in their rejection of Plato\u2019s theory of\ntransmigration, whether from human to human or from human to beast.\nAlthough these theories (hesitantly accepted even by Platonists in the\nthird century), gain some colour from Jewish traditions about Elijah\nand from punishments meted out to animals under the Levitical law,\nOrigen bows to the wisdom of the church, which declares them\ninadmissible (CommJohn 1.11.66; Princ. 1.8.5).\n\nCertainly at First Principles 1.4.1 he writes that satiety is\nthe commonest cause of falling, but the soul of which he speaks may be\nan embodied one, as it is when it repents a few lines later\n(Princ. 1.4.1). At First Principles 3.5.6, and again\nin his fragmentary commentary on Ephesians, he interprets the noun\nkatabol\u00ea at Ephesians 1.4 as an allusion to the\nsoul\u2019s descent to a body from the hand of God; but this descent,\nwhich is not a fall, is not said to coincide with the creation. We\nread that the soul of Christ adhered to the word with indissoluble\nlove ab initio creationis, but these words could signify\neither \u201cfrom the beginning of the creation\u201d or \u201cfrom\nthe beginning of its creation\u201d (Princ. 2.6.3\u20134).\nAt First Principles 1.7.1 we are said to be properly\nidentical with our rational element; but Gregory of Nyssa and\nAugustine said the same without being understood to mean that we have\never existed as disembodied souls. At Commentary on Matthew 16.35 he\nentertains the theory that souls await embodiment in Sheol, the place\nfrom which the soul of Samuel was raised by the Witch of Endor; since\nhe appears to be hinting here not only at a primordial existence of\nthe soul but at transmigration from body to body, we should not rely\ntoo heavily on this parenthetic chapter in a text which poses more\nthan the usual share of difficulties for its editors. That souls are\nalready rational in the foetal state is evident from the leaping of\nJohn the Baptist in Elizabeth\u2019s womb when he recognises the\nchild in the womb of Mary (Princ. 1.7.4). In his exegesis of\nJohn 1.31, Origen suggests that the Baptist deplores his failure to\nrecognise Jesus at the River Jordan because he has already known him\nin a previous life; since, however, he was prepared to entertain the\ntheory that the Baptist was an angel embodied for our sake, we cannot\ndeduce that Origen credited all souls with a sentient existence before\ntheir entry into this world (CommJohn 2.31.186). That the\nelements are ensouled can be inferred from Isaiah 1.2, where God calls\nheaven and earth to witness; and Job\u2019s exclamation, \u201cthe\nstars are not clean in his sight\u201d is applied by Origen to the\nsun and moon, who have been made \u201csubject to vanity\u201d for\nthe sake of those who inhabit the physical cosmos (Princ.\n1.7.2). Here it may be true that he borrows a tenet from the\nPlatonists, but not without biblical warrant, and the uncleanness of\nthe sun and moon is a consequence of their voluntary enthralment, not\nits cause (see further Scott 1994).\n\nIn Origen\u2019s extant writings, then, the doctrine of the\nsoul\u2019s fall through satiety, after centuries of beatitude as a\n\u201cpure intellect\u201d, is never so clearly stated as in later\nindictments of his heterodoxy. Many hold none the less that the\ncharges are true, and that Origen\u2019s advocacy of these doctrines\nis concealed from us by the loss or mutilation of the incriminating\ntexts. Others, relying chiefly on the texts that have been preserved,\nmaintain that for Origen the fall of souls was a tentative and\noccasional speculation or a myth, in Plato\u2019s sense, that was\nlater mistaken for a dogma (Harl 1987). It has also been argued that\nhis preserved words testify only to Origen\u2019s belief in the fall\nof angels (Princ. 1.5.3) and to the creation of the soul\nbefore its descent into the body; on this view, readers who came to\nhis work with formulaic expectations mingled his own opinions with the\nPlatonic tenets to which they bore a calculated but incomplete\nresemblance. No hypothesis has yet accounted for all that is said in\nthe surviving corpus of Origen\u2019s works. If, as Origen seems to\nhold (Princ. 3.6.1), the likeness of God was not yet\nconferred on the intellectual man who was created in the image of God,\nshould we infer that Adam\u2019s body was given to him as a means of\nacquiring the likeness, just as the Neoplatonist Porphyry, fifty years\nlater, taught that souls are implanted in bodies in order to cultivate\nvirtue through the struggle against temptation? On the other hand, if\nour initial state was in some respects unlike the present one, we may\nfind it hard to interpret Origen\u2019s dictum that the end, or\nconsummation (apokatastasis), is \u201cthe same as the\nbeginning\u201d (Princ. 1.6.2). The provenance of the noun\napokatastasis is more easily established than its meaning,\nfor even in the New Testament it may signify not so much the\nrestoration of that which was once the case as the realisation of that\nwhich ought to be (see further Tzamalikos 2007: 237\u2013356; Ramelli\n2013: 129\u2013221).\n\nAt First Principles 4.4.1 Origen scoffs that only a fool would suppose\nthat God had really planted a garden in Eden, as the second chapter of\nGenesis records. This has been taken to mean that he regards Eden not\nas a physical locality but as the state in which all souls enjoy the\npresence of God before they descend to bodies (Martens, 2013). Yet\nOrigen\u2019s chief concern here is to forestall the literal reading\nof the verb \u201cplanted\u201d, which, like other anthropomorphisms\nin scripture, is likely to mislead a recent convert from idolatry. No\ncritic infers, from Origen\u2019s denial that God descended in a\nbodily sense to destroy the tower of Babel (Against Celsus\n4.15\u201321), that he believes the tower itself to be fictitious; we\nshould therefore not be too ready to assume, with the malignant\nEpiphanius, that he denies the historicity of the when he adopts a\nmetaphorical construction of God\u2019s sewing of coats of skin for\nAdam and Eve at Genesis 3.21 (Epiphanius, Panarion 64.4.1; cf Heidl,\n2003: 138). If he also doubts that the trees of Eden were botanical\nplants, he is equally willing to give up other details in the story of\nbabel, but not the event itself. In a fragment preserved in a Greek\ncatena, he cites Adam\u2019s exclamation \u201cThis is bone of my\nbone and flesh of my flesh at Genesis 2.24 as proof that even before\nthe fall he possessed a body\u201d (Commentary on Genesis,\nFr. 22, p. 190 Metzler); from the sequel, as from Homilies on\nLeviticus 6.2, we may conclude that he held this body to be a\ndifferent texture from ours, but in his own parlance this would be an\ninstance of \u201chomonymy\u201d, the use of a scriptural term in\ndifferent senses which are equally literal. While the sin of Adam is a\nprecedent for all subsequent transgressions in his Commentary on\nRomans, this claim does not preclude, and has even been thought\nto presuppose, the physical descent of all human beings from this one\nancestor (Bammel, 1989). At Against Celsus 7.39 the\nprotoplasts fall from a state of immediate knowledge of God to one in\nwhich the mind is blinded by the senses but nothing is said to imply\nthat they then became corporeal agents for the first time. Of course\nmany ambiguities remain, and grammar alone will not determine whether\nthe phrase \u201call saints who have lived since the foundation of\nthe world\u201d (Martens, 2013: 532)implies that every soul has\nexisted from the beginning or only that from the beginning to the\npresent new souls are coming into existence with their bodies. \n\nHowever the soul\u2019s detention in the present world is accounted\nfor, its freedom to choose its own goods, and its own god, is an\nindefeasible premiss of Origen\u2019s philosophy. Astrologers who\npretend to read our fates from the stars can be answered with a quip\nfrom Epicurus: if all that comes to pass is predestined, so is the\nbelief in predestination, and we therefore have no reason to think it\ntrue (Philokalia 25.4). Even if the stars vouchsafe some\npremonitions of the future to the saints, we are not to suppose that\nthey are the causes of what they signify, or that God, who inscribes\nhis own knowledge in the heavens, is the cause of everything that he\nforesees. Because he is exempt from time, our future lies open to him\nas the past and present lie open; he knows, in the words of Paul,\nwhether each of his creatures is to be a vessel of honour or a vessel\nof dishonour. It is we, however, who make his knowledge true by our\nown choice of good or evil; the Gnostics misconstrue the\napostle\u2019s statement that God \u201cmakes\u201d us vessels of\nhonour or dishonour when they argue that the damned and the elect are\nof different natures. None of us is born virtuous but each of us (as\nAristotle says and common experience goes on telling us) has the power\nto advance in virtue by performing virtuous acts (Princ.\n3.1).\n",
