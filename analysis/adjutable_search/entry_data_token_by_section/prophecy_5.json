Middle Knowledge\n\nThis last approach to explaining how God knows the contingent future\nstarts with an observation concerning foreknowledge and providence\nthat advocates of open theism have made very clearly and forcefully.\nWhy would knowledge of the future be useful to God? Well, presumably\nknowledge of the future enables God to make decisions about how to\nexercise divine power in order to accomplish the purposes behind\ncreation. But there is a problem here: knowledge of the future is just\nknowledge of what will happen (since the future is by definition\nwhatever will happen), and once God knows that something definitely\nwill happen, then it\u2019s too late to do anything about it. (This\nmay sound like a limit on God\u2019s power, but probably it is not:\nnot even God can make something false while that same thing is known\nto be true.) As William Hasker says, \u201cIn the logical order of\ndependence of events, one might say, by the \u2018time\u2019 God\nknows something will happen, it is \u2018too late\u2019 either to\nbring about its happening or to prevent it from happening\u201d\n(Hasker 1989, 58). So what God needs, for the purposes of providence,\nis not just knowledge about what will happen, but also knowledge about\nwhat could happen and what would happen in certain circumstances. \n\nLuis de Molina, an influential Spanish Jesuit theologian\n(1535\u20131600 C.E.), thought that this was a serious problem. In\norder to develop a view that would explain the relationships between\nall of these things, he drew a distinction between three kinds of\nknowledge in God, a distinction that suggests another response to the\nproblem of prophecy. (For more complete and detailed presentations of\nthis view, see Freddoso\u2019s introduction to Molina 1988, Craig\n1987, Flint 1988 and Flint 1998.)\n\nAccording to Molina, the first kind of knowledge that God possesses is\ncalled natural knowledge. A true proposition is part of God\u2019s\nnatural knowledge if and only if it is a necessary truth (a truth\nwhich could not be false under any circumstances whatever) which is\nbeyond God\u2019s control (nobody, including God, could make them\nfalse). Examples of such true propositions would include \u201c2 + 2\n= 4\u201d, \u201cNothing is both red all over and green all over at\nonce\u201d, and \u201cEvery triangle has three sides.\u201d\n\nThe second kind of knowledge that God possesses is called free\nknowledge because it is subject to God\u2019s free decision.\nAccording to Molina, a true proposition is part of God\u2019s free\nknowledge if and only if it is a contingent truth (an actual truth\nwhich could have been false under different circumstances) that is\nwithin God\u2019s control. Examples of such true propositions would\ninclude \u201cThe same side of the moon always faces the\nEarth\u201d, \u201cHuman beings exist\u201d and \u201cThere are\niguanas in South America\u201d, since God could have brought it about\nthat these true propositions were false instead.\n\nThe third kind of knowledge that God possesses, according to Molina,\nis called middle knowledge (because it is \u201cin between\u201d\nGod\u2019s natural knowledge and free knowledge). A true proposition\nis part of God\u2019s middle knowledge if and only if it is a\ncontingent truth (like items of God\u2019s free knowledge) but beyond\nGod\u2019s control (like items of God\u2019s natural knowledge). The\nmost frequently discussed items of middle knowledge are often called\n\u201csubjunctive conditionals of freedom\u201d by philosophers,\nsince they describe what people would freely do if placed in various\npossible situations.\n\nMolina claims that God\u2019s providential control over the world\ninvolves middle knowledge in a crucial way. Very briefly, here is how\nit is supposed to work: through natural knowledge, God knows what is\nnecessary and what is possible. Through middle knowledge, God knows\nwhat every possible person would do freely in every possible\nsituation, among other things. So God decides which kind of world to\ncreate, including those situations in which free human persons should\nbe placed, knowing how they would respond, and this results in\nGod\u2019s free knowledge (contingent truths which are up to God),\nincluding foreknowledge of the actual future.\n\nIn the case of Jesus\u2019 prophecy that Peter would deny him,\nMolinists would say that God knew (through middle knowledge) that if\nPeter were placed in certain circumstances, then he would deny Jesus.\nAnd for reasons not known to us, God decided to create those\ncircumstances, place Peter in them, and prophecy through Jesus what\nPeter was going to do. (For a much more detailed explanation, see\nFlint 1998, chapter 9.) Molina\u2019s theory of middle knowledge\ngenerates a theory of providence designed to combine a strong notion\nof God\u2019s control with a robust account of the contingency\ninvolved in human freedom. (It also appears to have some biblical\nsupport, because there are verses which seem to attribute middle\nknowledge to God, although this is disputed: see I Samuel\n23:6\u201313 and Matthew 11:20\u201324, for example.) \n\nHowever, philosophers have expressed several doubts about whether or\nnot it is possible for God to possess middle knowledge, doubts that\nparallel those expressed above in connection with the possibility of\nGod\u2019s foreknowledge of the contingent future. For one thing,\nthey wonder about subjunctive conditionals of freedom: can we really\nassume that these are either true or false? How can they be true if\n(for example) the person in question is never in the situation and\nnever actually makes a choice? What \u201cgrounds\u201d them or\nmakes them true? A second worry about Molina\u2019s picture has to do\nwith the nature of knowledge. Even if a given counterfactual of\nfreedom is true, knowing a proposition requires that a person be able\nto distinguish what is true from what is false. The worry here is that\nperhaps not even God could distinguish true counterfactuals of freedom\nfrom false ones. (For more detailed discussions of these objections,\nsee Adams 1977, Freddoso\u2019s introduction to Molina 1988, Craig\n1987, Flint 1988, Flint 1998, Hasker 1989, Davison 1991, and Perszyk\n2011, and Oppy and Saward 2014; for a clever attempt to explain\nprophecy without middle knowledge, see Pruss 2007 and the response\nfrom Corabi and Germino 2013.) \n",
