    "main_text": "Assimilation to Non-Biological Explanations\n3. Assimilation to Non-Biological Explanations\n\nErnest Nagel (1961) and Carl Hempel (1965) provide early attempts by\nphilosophers of science to directly assimilate functional explanation\nin biology to more general patterns of explanation. In particular,\nthey both consider functional explanation within the framework of the\n Deductive-Nomological account of scientific explanation.\n They consider the functional claims to be related to explanations of\nthe presence of a trait in an organism. Their accounts differ\nprimarily on whether to say that a trait T has function\nF in organism O when T is sufficient to produce\nF in O (Hempel\u2019s version) or when T is\nnecessary to produce F in O (Nagel\u2019s version).\n\n\nLarry Wright (1973, 1976) also offers an explanatory account targeted\non the presence of the trait, but he criticizes the prior accounts for\nfailing to capture the apparent goal-directedness of functional\ntraits. His so-called \u201cetiological\u201d analysis holds that\nthe function of X is Z means (a) X is there\nbecause it does Z, and (b) Z is a consequence (or\nresult) of X\u2019s being there. Because of the intended\nbreadth of Wright\u2019s analysis, it has been attacked on conceptual\ngrounds (e.g., Boorse 1976), but the general thrust of the etiological\naccount survives in accounts of function based on natural selection,\ndiscussed in section 4. \n\nCummins (1975) criticized both Hempel and Nagel on the grounds that\nthe proper target of explanation of biological function claims is not\nthe presence of a trait, but the capacities of biological organs and\norganisms. Sophisticated capacities can be analyzed in terms of the\ncontributions that their components make to those capacities. For\nexample, the heart of a bilaterian animal pumps blood, which in this\nway contributes to the capacity of the organism to deliver oxygen and\nnutrients to its tissues. The heart itself can be further decomposed\ninto parts (chambers, valves, etc.) which each play different\nfunctional roles in contributing to that organ\u2019s capacity to\npump blood. Among philosophers, this approach to functional analysis\nis most associated with Cummins (1975), although biologists have\nadvanced similar ideas, sometimes independently (Hinde 1975; Lauder\n1982), and indeed the approach can be traced much further back, as the\nquotation from William Harvey in the introduction suggests.\nCummins\u2019 ideas about functional analysis have been incorporated\nin recent discussion on mechanisms in the biological sciences (see the\nentry on\n mechanisms in science).\n For instance, Craver (2007) explicitly draws on Cummins (1975) in his\naccount and is important for moving teleological descriptions down to\nthe molecular level (see also, Craver 2001, 2013). \n\nAccording to Cummins, although biological systems certainly have\ncapacities that are uniquely biological, there is nothing specifically\nbiological about the pattern of explanation offered by functional\nanalysis; it applies equally well, for example to the contributions\nmade by the components of artifacts (Lewens 2004), for example the\ncontributions of the engine\u2019s pistons in the capacity of an\nautomobile to transport people. Because of the generality of the\nframework, it is also possible to give a functional analysis of how\nsome part of a biological system contributes to outcomes usually\ntreated as negative, such as disease or death. Some commentators\nregard this as a virtue of the approach, while others regard it as too\ndetached from standard biological practice. Relatedly, the functional\nanalysis approach fails to live up to the commonly-held desideratum that\nan adequate account should provide an analysis of malfunction\u2014a\ndesideratum that Cummins explicitly rejects (see also Wouters 1999 and\nDavies 2001). A heart with a hole in its septum may not circulate\nblood at a level sufficient to sustain life, but it thereby simply\nlacks that function. \n",
