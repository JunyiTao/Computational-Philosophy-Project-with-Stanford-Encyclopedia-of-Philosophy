    "main_text": "\n\nThere are a variety of ways that feminists have reflected upon and\nengaged with science critically and constructively each of which might\nbe thought of as perspectives on science. Feminists have detailed the\nhistorically gendered participation in the practice of\nscience\u2014the marginalization or exclusion of women from the\nprofession and how their contributions have disappeared when they have\nparticipated. Feminists have also noted how the sciences have been\nslow to study women\u2019s lives, bodies, and experiences. Thus from\nboth the perspectives of the agents\u2014the creators of scientific\nknowledge\u2014and from the perspectives of the subjects of\nknowledge\u2014the topics and interests focused on\u2014the sciences\noften have not served women satisfactorily. We can think of these\nperspectives as generating two types of equity issues: limitations on\nthe freedom to participate as reflected in the historical\nunderrepresentation of women in the scientific professions and the\nrelative lack of attention to research questions relevant to\nwomen\u2019s lives.\n\nFeminist perspectives encompass more than equity issues however. They\nextend to questions about the methodology, epistemology, and ontology\nof scientific inquiry as well. Feminists have scrutinized explicit\nways that scientific research has been affected by sexist and gendered\npresuppositions about the subject matter and the methods appropriate\nto the sciences. Such investigations have sometimes revealed how\nscientific practice has failed to meet standards of good science.\nAdditionally, and more radically, feminists have questioned\ntraditional methodologies and offered alternative approaches better\nsuited to feminist subject matter and goals. Feminist perspectives on\nscientific knowledge production have been constructive where\ncriticisms have motivated alternative conceptualization of subject\nmatter, greater attention to the goals of scientific research, and\nreflection on the epistemological and ontological commitments of\nmethodology.\n\nMost generally feminists are united in urging recognition of the\nsocial contexts in which scientific research takes place and\nscientific knowledge is received. As such, feminist approaches to\nscience are situated in broader movements in philosophy of science and\nscience studies that emerged during the second half of the twentieth\ncentury. Such approaches acknowledge and explore the social nature of\nscientific knowledge (for example: Kuhn 1962 [1970]; Longino 1990,\n2002; Kitcher 1993, 2001; Solomon 2001). Additionally, they are\nsituated in the liberatory movements of the 1960s and 1970s. As the\nparticipation of women in the sciences increased in the second half of\nthe twentieth century, the effects of the absence of women as\nresearchers and women\u2019s lives as subjects of knowledge were more\nreadily apparent. The coinciding feminist movements during the same\nperiod provided frameworks through which to theorize these lacunae and\nunderstand them as aspects of oppression.\n\nWhile the discussion thus far might suggest that feminists are a\nunited group whose perspectives differ only over their focus that is\nnot the case. Feminists vary among themselves in their political goals\nas well as in their epistemic and ontological commitments (see\n Feminist Philosophy).\n Not all feminisms are the same and consequently this is an additional\ndimension on which perspectives on science differ. Feminist philosophy\nof science and science studies is now a mature area of research and\nsubtle, internal debates reflect this. Even so it is possible to\nidentify some general areas of agreement. Minimally, feminist\nperspectives on science start from the premise that the question of\nwhether sex/gender matters to the production of scientific knowledge\nshould be taken as an open question. It cannot be assumed to be\nirrelevant as it so often was in the past. The question of how,\nwhere, why, and when gender is relevant is where various\nfeminist views differ. Additionally, the sciences themselves vary and\nso how they are viewed, which are deemed most relevant to feminism and\naffected by sex/gender and in what ways they might be affected is not\nlikely to be uniform. Accordingly, this entry seeks to capture\nfeminist perspectives both from the different political, epistemic,\nand social locations through which feminists view science as well as\nfrom the differences in focus feminists have when considering\nscientific knowledge production. That being said, it should be noted\nthat the entry prioritizes the social and life sciences when\ndiscussing subject matter (although not when discussing the\nparticipation of women in the science professions). This is because\nfeminists have been most active in investigating the operation of\nsexist assumptions in the social and life sciences. It should also be\nnoted that the philosophical perspective of this entry is\npredominantly Anglo-American and so does not include an analysis of,\nfor example, feminist approaches in the tradition of Continental\nphilosophy or careful consideration of issues that affect the global\nSouth. There are likely other lessons to learn from how feminist\napproach science in these other cultural, social, and historical\ncontexts. Some recent work by Sandra Harding on Latin American science\nstudies offers an example of how such differences in context matter\n(Harding 2017, 2019).\n",
