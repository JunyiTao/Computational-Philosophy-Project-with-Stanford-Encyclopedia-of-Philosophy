    "main_text": "Basic Categories || The Heart-Mind and the Things-Events\n1.1 The Heart-Mind and the Things-Events\n\nIn classical Chinese philosophy the meaning of the Chinese word\nxin \u5fc3, which literally refers to the physical heart,\nis not limited to its common connotations. Unlike Western definitions,\nthe Chinese metaphorical understanding of this notion not only denotes\nthis organ as the center of emotions, but also as the center of\nperception, understanding, intuition and even rational thought. As\nancient Chinese believed that the heart was the center of human\ncognition, the notion of xin is most commonly translated as\n\u201cheart-mind\u201d in philosophical discourses. This\nunderstanding was determined by the absence of the contrast between\ncognitive (representative ideas, reasoning, beliefs) and affective\n(sensation, feelings, desires, emotions) states.\n\nIn classical Chinese epistemologies, each person\u2019s\nself-awareness was based upon a holistic understanding of the world,\nwhich was structured as an interactive relationship between human\nbeings and nature (tianren heyi\n\u5929\u4eba\u5408\u4e00). The unity of all cosmic beings was\nseen in terms of the organismic and dynamic wholeness of nature and\nsociety. Hence, self-awareness as the basis of any kind of\ncomprehension originated with the awareness that one\u2019s own being\nwas organically embedded and interwoven with (rational) indeterminate,\nconstitutive cosmic structures. The heart-mind which represents the\ncrucial part of this self-awareness, is innately equipped with the\nbasic structure of (moral) recognition.\n\nThe origins of this tradition reach far back into pre-Qin intellectual\nhistory. The human heart-mind was not only posited as the seat of the\nconcept of mind or consciousness and thus the source of both emotions\nand reasoning, but was also perceived as a kind of sense organ by the\nancient Chinese. Indeed, Mengzi (372\u2013289 BC) sometimes even\nviews it as the principal sense organ, responsible for selecting and\ninterpreting the sensations transmitted to it by other sense organs\n(Mengzi CTP: Gaozi shang, 15). In other words, while the\nlatter enabled perception, the heart-mind enabled the comprehension of\nexternal reality or that part of reality transmitted by the sense\norgans. In Guanzi, a philosophical work ascribed to the\nlegalist politician Guan Zhong (7th century BC, although\nprobably dating much later) the leading function of mind does not\nrefer merely to the sense organs, but also to all other major organs\nas for instance intestines or bladder (Guanzi CTP: Jiu shou,\n6). Later on, such an approach was typical of the legalist scholars,\nwho set the concepts of Confucian hierarchy upon absolutist\nfoundations. Such discourses also recall the relation between the\n(inferior) body and the (superior) spirit. However, in the early\nChinese philosophical texts hearing and seeing seem to be regarded as\nthe most important senses in that they play the most significant role\nin acquiring knowledge (Geaney 2002). In most ancient Chinese\nphilosophical discourses the body-mind relationship was seen as an\norganic unity, determined by the principle of complementarity. This\nled to the establishment of bodily recognition (tiren\n\u9ad4\u8a8d or tiyan \u9ad4\u9a57) that belongs to\nthe fundamental methods of perception (Ni 2002: 287) in traditional\nChinese epistemology.\n\nThus, with the exception of the Mohist school which elaborated some\ndivisions regarding the problem of things as they are\n(shi \u662f) and things as they appear\n(ran \u7136) (Mozi CTP: Xiao qu, 8), the\nheart-mind as the inherent organ of perception was seen as\ncontinuously integrated with the phenomena of the external world that\nmanifested themselves in the notion things-events (wu\n\u7269). Hence, instead of establishing a clear demarcation line\nbetween the subject and the object of comprehension, human perception\nand recognition of reality were mostly seen as a product of a\ncoherent, structurally ordered and complementary interaction between\nthe heart-mind and the things-events. This continuity of internal and\nexternal worlds prevailed in classical Chinese epistemology until the\n11th century, i.e., till the earliest beginnings of\nNeo-Confucian philosophy, when it was further developed.\n",
