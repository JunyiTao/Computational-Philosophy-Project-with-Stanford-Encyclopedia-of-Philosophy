    "main_text": "Value Incommensurability || Conceptions of Value Incommensurability\n1.3 Conceptions of Value Incommensurability \n\nThis section outlines three conceptions of value incommensurability,\neach one capturing some sense in which incommensurability is due to\nthe lack of a common measure.\n\nThe first conception characterizes value incommensurability in terms\nof restrictions on how the further realization of one value outranks\nrealization of another value. James Griffin has proposed forms of\nvalue incommensurability of this sort. One form involves what he calls\n\u201ctrumping.\u201d In a conflict between values A and\nB, A is said to trump B if\n\u201cany amount of A, no matter how small, is more\nvaluable than any amount of B, no matter how\nlarge\u201d (Griffin 1986, 83). A weaker form of value\nincommensurability involves what Griffin calls\n\u201cdiscontinuity.\u201d Two values, A and B,\nare incommensurable in this sense if \u201cso long as we have enough\nof B any amount of A outranks any further amount of\nB; or that enough of A outranks any amount of\nB\u201d (Griffin 1986, 85).\n\nIf values are incommensurable in this first sense, there is no\nambiguity whether the realization of one value outranks realization of\nthe other. Ambiguity as to whether the realization of one value\noutranks realization of the other, however, is thought by many\ntheorists to be a central feature of incommensurable values. The\nsecond and third conceptions of value incommensurability aim to\ncapture this feature.\n\nAccording to the second conception, values are incommensurable if and\nonly if there is no true general overall ranking of the realization of\none value against the realization of the other value. David Wiggins,\nfor example, puts this forward as one conception of value\nincommensurability. He writes that two values are incommensurable if\n\u201cthere is no general way in which A and B trade off in the whole\nrange of situations of choice and comparison in which they\nfigure\u201d (1997, 59).\n\nThis second conception of value incommensurability denies what Henry\nRichardson calls \u201cstrong commensurability\u201d (1994,\n104\u2013105). Strong commensurability is the thesis that there is a true\nranking of the realization of one value against the realization of the\nother value in terms of one common value across all conflicts of\nvalue. A denial of such a singular common value, however, does not\nrule out what Richardson calls \u201cweak commensurability\u201d\n(1994, 105). Weak commensurability is the thesis that in any given\nconflict of values, there is a true ranking of the realization of one\nvalue against the realization of the other value in terms of some\nvalue. This value may be one of the values in question or some\nindependent value. This value also may differ across value conflicts.\nThe denial of strong commensurability does not entail a denial of weak\ncommensurability. Even if there is no systematic or general way to\nresolve any given conflict of values, there may be some value in\nvirtue of which the realization of one value ranks against realization\nof the other. Donald Regan defends the thesis of strong\ncommensurability (Regan 1997).\n\nThe third conception of value incommensurability denies both strong\nand weak commensurability (Richardson 1994, Wiggins 1997, Williams\n1981). This conception claims that in some conflicts of values, there\nis no true ranking of values.\n\nThis third conception of value incommensurability is sometimes said to\nbe necessary to explain why, in conflicts of value, a gain in one\nvalue does not always cancel the loss in another value. This view\nassumes that, whenever there is a true ranking between the realization\nof one value and the realization of another value, the gain in one of\nthe values cancels the loss in the other. Many commentators question\nthat assumption. This entry leaves open the possibility that when\nthere is a true ranking between the realization of one value and the\nrealization of another value, the gain in one of the two values need\nnot cancel the loss in the other.\n\nIf we accept this possibility, a number of questions arise. One\nquestion is what a ranking of realizations of values means if a gain\nin one value does not cancel the loss in the other. A second question\nis whether the first and second conceptions of value\nincommensurability each admit of two versions: one version in which\nthe gain in one value cancels the loss of the other and one version in\nwhich it does not. A third question concerns the relation between\nvalue incommensurability and tragedy. It may be thought that what\nmakes a choice tragic is that, no matter which alternative is chosen,\nthe gain in value cannot cancel the loss in the other value. Not all\nauthors, however, regard all value conflicts involving incommensurable\nvalues as tragic (Richardson 1994, 117). Wiggins, for example,\nreserves the second conception of value incommensurability for what he\ncalls \u201ccommon or garden variety incommensurable\u201d choices\nand the third conception for what he calls \u201ccircumstantially cum\ntragically incommensurable\u201d choices (1997, 64).\n",
