    "main_text": "Simpson\u2019s Paradox and Causal Inference\n3. Simpson\u2019s Paradox and Causal Inference\n\nWithin the philosophical literature, Simpson\u2019s Paradox received\nsustained attention due to its implications for accounts of causality\nthat posit systematic connections between causal relationships and\nprobability-raising. Specifically, the paradox reveals that facts\nabout probability-raising will not necessarily be preserved when one\npartitions a population into subpopulations. This poses a number of\nimportant challenges to philosophical accounts of causal inference\nbased on the concept of probability:\n\nWhat is the appropriate set of background factors for determining\nwhen a probabilistic relationship is causal?\nWhat do association reversals imply for causal inference?\nDoes Simpson\u2019s Paradox threaten the objectivity of causal\nrelationships?\n\n\nStrategies for treating the paradox and answering these questions have\ncontributed substantially to the development of theories of\nprobabilistic causality (Cartwright 1979; Eells 1991). A different set\nof answers is provided by more recent work on the paradox in the\nframework of graphical causal models (e.g., Pearl 1988, 2000 [2009];\nSpirtes et al. 2000), and we will discuss both accounts in turn. In\nparticular, we will explain how Simpson\u2019s Paradox can be\nanalyzed through the notions of confounding and the identifiability of\na causal effect.\n",
