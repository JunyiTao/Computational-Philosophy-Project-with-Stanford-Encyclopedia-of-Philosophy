    "main_text": "The Role(s) of Decoherence in Different Approaches to Quantum Mechanics || Everett theories\n3.1 Everett theories\n\nThe Everett theory (see the entries on\n Everett\u2019s relative-state interpretation\n and on the\n many-worlds interpretation)\n was originally developed in 1957, before the theory of decoherence\n(Everett 1957). As we shall see, in recent years decoherence has\nbecome a defining notion of the theory, but it arguably fits rather\nwell also with Everett\u2019s original formulation.\n\nThe central technical notion in Everett\u2019s own formulation of the\ntheory is a relative state: e.g. the electron is in a state of\nspin up relative to the corresponding read-out state of the apparatus\nand in a state of spin down relative to the other read-out state. But Everett is interested in the emergence of\nstable structures in the universal wavefunction in terms of\nrelative states. His paradigm example is that of a hydrogen atom: put\na proton and an electron in a box, both spread out over the entire\nvolume. After a while, the proton and electron will have relaxed. The\nposition of the proton will still be spread out over the entire box,\nbut relative to each position state of the proton, the electron wil\nnow be in the usual ground state of the hydrogen atom. According to\nEverett, this is what we mean by a stable atom forming. Everett\nthinks of classical systems (a cannonball!) along the same lines, and\nuses these arguments as justifying the assumption that classical\nsystems exist, in particular ones that are complex enough to store\n(and perhaps act upon) records of measurement-like interactions they\nhave had with their environments. Everett\u2019s aim is to recover\nthe usual predictions of quantum mechanics for the memory registers of\nsuch\n\u2018servomechanisms\u2019.[15][16]\n\n\nIt should be clear that the theory of decoherence is an ideal\ntechnical tool if (like Everett) one wishes to identify stable\nstructures within the universal wave function. And, indeed, some of\nthe main workers in the field such as Zeh (2000) and (perhaps more\nguardedly) Zurek (1998) and Gell-Mann and Hartle (e.g. 1990) suggest\nthat decoherence is most naturally understood in terms of Everett-like\n interpretations.[17]\n This role of decoherence has been emphasised most prominently by\nSaunders (e.g. 1993) and by Wallace (e.g. 2003), and is in fact\nresponsible for the extraordinary renaissance of the Everett theory\nwithin the philosophy of physics since the\n mid-1990s.[18]\n\nUntil then, Everett was thought to be suffering from a problem of the\n\u2018preferred\n basis\u2019:[19]\n it was thought that without putting in by hand what should count as\n\u2018worlds\u2019, there were too many possible ways of defining\nsuch worlds, or too many ways of defining relative states. But looking\nfor potentially relevant structures that are already present in the\nwave function allows one to identify worlds (or other relevant\nstructures) without having to postulate the existence of some\npreferred states (whether or not they form an orthonormal basis). \n\nA justification for this identification can be variously\ngiven by suggesting that a \u2018world\u2019 should be a\ntemporally extended structure and thus reidentification over\ntime will be a necessary condition for defining worlds; or similarly\nby suggesting that in order for observers to have evolved\nthere must be stable records of past events (Saunders 1993,\nand the unpublished Gell-Mann and Hartle 1994 \u2013 see the\n Other Internet Resources\n section below); or that observers must be able to access robust\nstates, preferably through the existence of redundant information\nin the environment (Zurek\u2019s \u2018existential\ninterpretation\u2019,\n 1998).[20]\n But the most comprehensive justification of the use of decoherence in\nterms of how Everett can be understood using structures in the\nuniversal wave function has been given by Wallace, starting with his\n(2003) and given its final form in his book (2012a). Wallace places\nhis discussion in the wider context of an approach to emergence based\non Dennett\u2019s notion of \u2018real patterns\u2019. Higher-level\ntheories are functionally instantiated by lower-level (more\nfundamental) ones if there exist relatively simple mappings from\nsolutions of the lower-level theory over a certain domain to solutions\nof the higher-level theory. Higher-level structures are thus reduced\nto patterns at the more fundamental level, which are real in the\n(quasi-)Dennettian sense that they are objectively useful in terms of\nboth predicting and explaining phenomena at the higher level. At the\nsame time they are emergent, because they could be multiply realised,\nand because finding the relevant mapping may be possible only in a\ntop-down perspective. Everettian worlds are such real patterns,\nbecause decoherence ensures their dynamical independence of each\nother. \n\nAlternatively to some global notion of a world, one can look at the\ncomponents of the (mixed) state of a (local) system, either from the\npoint of view that the different components defined by decoherence\nwill separately affect (different components of the state of) another\nsystem, or from the point of view that they will separately underlie\nthe conscious experience (if any) of the system. The former sits well\nwith the relational interpretation of Everett as put forward in the\n1990s by Saunders (e.g. 1993), possibly with Zurek\u2019s (1998)\nviews, and arguably with Everett\u2019s (1957) original notion of\nrelative\n state.[21]\n The latter leads directly to the idea of \u2018many-minds\u2019 in\nthe sense used by Zeh (2000; also 2003a, p. 24). As Zeh puts it, \nthe \u2018psycho-physical parallelism\u2019 invoked by von Neumann \n(cf. below Section 3.4.1) is to be understood as the\nrequirement of supervenience of the mental on the physical: only one\nmental state is experienced, so there should be only one corresponding\ncomponent in the physical state. In a decohering no-collapse universe\none can instead introduce a new psycho-physical parallelism,\nin which individual minds supervene on each non-interfering component\nin the physical state. (This is different from the many-minds\ninterpretation of Albert and Loewer (1988), where the mental\ndoes not supervene on the physical, because individual minds\nhave trans-temporal identity of their\nown.[22]) Zeh\nindeed suggests that, given decoherence, this is the most natural\ninterpretation of quantum\n mechanics.[23]\n\n",
