The futility of specifying the marks and features of objectification\n\nRecently, Nancy Bauer has expressed scepticism regarding the\npossibility of laying out a set of criteria for what counts as sexual\nobjectification. She argues that it is difficult to specify the marks\nand features of a term that plays a normative role in our mutually\nshared worldview. And if the term in question is important to my\noutlook, but not yours, she claims that it is impossible for me to\nspecify criteria for the term\u2019s application that pick out the\nphenomenon from your point of view. She writes: \u201cIf the term\n\u2018sexual objectification\u2019 is critical in helping you make\nsense of the world as you see it, then, more or less, you will know\nsexual objectification when you see it. \u2026 Insofar as the\nphilosophical literature sets out to delineate the marks and features\nof sexual objectification, it is bound not only to fail but to miss\nthe very phenomenon it seeks to illuminate\u201d (Bauer 2015, part\nI).\n\nRegarding the feminist concept of sexual objectification, Bauer\nexplains that it was coined as part of a feminist shift in how to\nunderstand the world and one\u2019s experience in it. According to\nthe shift in question, in a context in which women experience\nwidespread, systematic, diachronic, and structural disadvantages,\ncertain ways of perceiving and representing women tend to cause them\nmaterial and psychological harm. Bauer argues that once someone\nparticipates in this shift, the term \u2018sexual\nobjectification\u2019 will \u2018light up\u2019 the relevant\nphenomena, and the person in question will see objectification\neverywhere she looks in contemporary culture. This is the case even if\nshe is not in a position to specify exactly its marks and features.\nBauer explains that \u2018lighting up\u2019 in certain cases may\ntake the form of a conversion experience that consists in our seeing\nthings that we did not see before. For Bauer, the metaphor of\n\u2018lighting up\u2019 is crucial in thinking about sexual\nobjectification and other terms that make sense only in a context of a\nsystematic normative way of understanding the world (what she calls a\n\u2018worldview\u2019 (Bauer 2015, part II)).\n",
