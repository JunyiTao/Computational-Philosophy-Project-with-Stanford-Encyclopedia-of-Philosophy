    "main_text": "Quantification and Ontology\n4. Quantification and Ontology\n\nMuch of contemporary ontology builds on the assumption that existence\nis to be understood in terms of quantification: in a slogan, to exist\nis to be something. Ontology is largely concerned with the domain of\nthe existential quantifier. This assumption can be traced\nback to the work of Frege and Russell, both of whom analyzed\nquantification in terms of predication, and plays a crucial role in\nQuine\u2019s admonition to transform ontology into the study of the\nontological commitments of our global theory of the world regimented\nin the language of quantificational logic and identity.\n",
