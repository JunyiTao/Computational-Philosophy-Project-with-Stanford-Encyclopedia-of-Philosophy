    "main_text": "The Star of Redemption || Part III\n3.5 Part III\n\n\nBut if the unity of the system is projected into the future, can it\ntruly be known in the present? The third part of the\nStar presents life within the Jewish and Christian religious\ncommunities as the surprising answer to this question. According to\nRosenzweig, life within these communities allows for the possibility of\n\u201canticipating\u201d the ultimate redemptive unity of the\n\u201cAll\u201d. The social practices through which these communities\nconstitute themselves lay the groundwork for such communal\nanticipation. More significantly, the course of the Jewish and\nChristian liturgical calendars\u2014the yearly path along which\nJewish and Christian communities celebrate creation, revelation, and\nredemption, each in its own particular manner\u2014makes it\npossible, according to Rosenzweig, for members of these communities to\nenvision within time, the ultimate unity of the \u201cAll\u201d that\nwill only be actual in the future redemption. Judaism and Christianity\nare thus to be understood, according to Rosenzweig, as\n\u201cguarantees\u201d of that ultimate redemption. Life within\nJewish or Christian community enables the person who stands in the\nmiddle of the course of the \u201cAll\u201d to see the ultimate unity\ntowards which all particular beings strive through relations, and to\ntake her place within this course with confidence.\n\n\nBut even as they serve as \u201cguarantees\u201d of the future\nredemption, Judaism and Christianity also serve crucial roles,\naccording to Rosenzweig, in realizing the actual redemption in\nthe world. Here Rosenzweig introduces the conclusions he reached back\nin 1913 regarding the complementary roles Judaism and Christianity play\nin the world\u2019s advance towards redemption. The Jewish people\nanticipates the ultimate redemption of the world within the closed,\ncommunal life it forges out of its intimate experience of relation with\nthe divine. Christianity advances the cause of the actual\nredemption of the world, by uniting the globe through its message of\ndivine love. While Christianity thus takes up the historical task of\nguiding the world towards redemption, it would lose its way, according\nto Rosenzweig, if the Jewish people did not perpetually serve as\nreminder, through its own communal anticipation of redemption, of the\nkind of unity before the divine for which the world is to strive.\n\n\nAfter presenting the course of relations between God, world, and the\nself as directed towards the ultimate unification of the\n\u201cAll\u201d, then, Rosenzweig suggests that the ways in which\nJudaism and Christianity make it possible to anticipate the ultimate\nfuture unity of the \u201cAll\u201d itself, serve to bring the\nsystematic knowledge of the \u201cAll\u201d that is possible for\nhuman beings to its completion. In the \u201cGate\u201d section with\nwhich the Star ends, Rosenzweig depicts the vision of\nredemptive unity with which knowledge of the identity and difference of\nthe \u201cAll\u201d is completed, as a vision of the star of\nredemption, the same star Rosenzweig suggested was constructed\ngeometrically out of the elemental God, world, and self as they stepped\ninto the relations of creation, revelation, and redemption. In this\nimage of a star, Rosenzweig identifies the face of God. But he suggests\nthat seeing God\u2019s face at once directs those human beings who\npursue knowledge of the \u201cAll\u201d back into the domain of human\nfaces, into that nexus of interpersonal relations through which the\nredemptive unity of the All is to be achieved in actuality.\n\n\nRosenzweig sends his readers out of the \u201cGate\u201d at the\nend of the Star back \u201cinto life,\u201d directing them\nto take on the redemptive task of unifying the \u201cAll\u201d which\nthe book itself describes. Rosenzweig thereby ascribes to human beings\na noteworthy relationship to truth itself. The systematic truth\nrevealed in the Star is not a thing that one might claim to\nknow or to experience like other things in the world. Truth is the\nredemptive goal of a course in which human beings participate. As a\nresult, human beings stand, according to Rosenzweig, in a relationship\nof \u201cverification\u201d to truth itself. Human beings verify the\ntruth of the unity of the \u201cAll\u201d by taking up the task of\nits realization. It is the task of the readers of the Star,\nRosenzweig implies, to make the \u201ceveryday\u201d context of their\nlives reflect and take part in this advance towards redemptive\ntruth.\n\n\nThe ending of the Star also sends the reader\nback into life at a particular moment in history. Here one must note\nthat Rosenzweig saw his time in history as particularly momentous.\nThe culmination of the philosophical tradition in German Idealism, so\nRosenzweig contended, coincided with the ending of the second epoch of\nthe world\u2019s historical advance towards redemption under Christian\nauspices, and the beginning of its third and final historical epoch:\nthe founding of the Church of John which Schelling foretold in his\nPhilosophy of Revelation. Rosenzweig understood his own time\nto be that of the \u201cJohannine completion\u201d of historical\ntemporality, and he even saw in the battles and revolutions through\nwhich he wrote the Star evidence of the advance of world\nhistory towards its ultimate redemption.\n",
