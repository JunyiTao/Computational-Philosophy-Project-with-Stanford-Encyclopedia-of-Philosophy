This standardly makes up part of the arguments that it is\nwrong to eat animals.\n\nThese arguments against meat production can be extended mutatis\nmutandis to animal product\n production.[9]\n They can be extended, too, to some forms of plant production. This\nsuggests:\n\n\nThe arguments against industrial plant production and animal product\nproduction are as strong as the arguments against meat production.\n\nThe arguments against meat production show that meat production is\nwrong. Hence,\n\nThe arguments against industrial plant production and animal product\nproduction show that those practices are wrong.\n\n\nOne possibility is that the first premise is false and that some of\nthe arguments are stronger than others.\n\nAnother possibility is that the first premise is true and all these\narguments are equally strong. We would then have to choose between\naccepting the second premise\u2014and thereby accepting the\nconclusion\u2014or denying that meat production is wrong.\n\nAnother possibility is that the argument is sound but of limited\nscope, there being few if any alternatives in the industrialized West\nto industrialized plant, animal product, and meat production.\n\nA final possibility is that the parity of these arguments and evident\nunsoundness of an argument against industrial plant production show\nthat the ideas behind those arguments are being misexpressed. Properly\nunderstood, they issue not in a directive about the wrongness of this\npractice or that. Rather, properly understood, they just show that\nvarious practices are bad in various ways. If so, we can then ask:\nWhich are worse? And in which ways? The literature typically ranks\nfactory farming as worse for animals than industrial plant farming if\nonly because the former requires the latter and produces various\nharms\u2014the suffering of billions of chickens\u2014that the\nlatter does not. Or consider the debate in the literature about the\nrelative harmfulness to animals of freerange farming and industrial\nplant farming. Which produces more animal death or more animal\nsuffering? Ought we minimize that suffering? Or consider the relative\nharmfulness of freerange and industrial animal farming. Some argue\nthat the former is worse for the environment but better for animals.\nIf so, there is a not-easy question about which, if either, to go in\nfor.\n",
