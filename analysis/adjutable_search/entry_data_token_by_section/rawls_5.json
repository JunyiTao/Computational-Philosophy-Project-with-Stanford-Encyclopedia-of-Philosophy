    "main_text": "Aims and Method || The Independence of Moral and Political Theory\n2.5 The Independence of Moral and Political Theory\n\nIn working toward greater reflective equilibrium, any type of belief\ncan in principle be relevant to one\u2019s conclusions about how\npolitical institutions should be arranged. Metaphysical beliefs about\nfree will or personal identity might be relevant, as could\nepistemological beliefs about how we come to know what moral facts\nthere are. However, while this is correct in principle, Rawls holds\nthat in practice productive moral and political theorizing will\nproceed to a large extent independent of metaphysics and epistemology.\nIndeed, as a methodological presumption Rawls reverses the traditional\norder of priority. Progress in metaethics will derive from progress in\nsubstantive moral and political theorizing, instead of (as often\nassumed) vice versa (CP, 286\u2013302).\n\nRawls\u2019s own metaethical theory of the objectivity and validity\nof political judgments, political constructivism, will be described\nbelow, after the substantive political theory from which it\nemerges.\n",
