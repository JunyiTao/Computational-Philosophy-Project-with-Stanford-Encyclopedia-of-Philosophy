    "main_text": "Constructivism About Moral Principles\n5. Constructivism About Moral Principles\n\nSome constructivist theories define their scope more narrowly than the\ntheories discussed in\n sections 2\u20134.\n They seek to provide objectivist accounts of the basic principles of\nmorality, rather than of all normative principles. Most\nconstructivists about morality hold that the relevant sort of\nagreement of which moral reasons are the product is best captured in\nterms of a hypothetical contract (Scanlon 1998; Hill 1989, 2001; Milo\n1995). \u2018Contractualism\u2019 is thus the normative theory that\nis typically associated with metaethical constructivism, even though\nit is not accepted by all Kantians (compare O\u2019Neill 1989a: 10;\nO\u2019Neill 2015). Hobbesian theories occupy a prominent place in\nthe contractualism debate. To explain the nature of morality and of\nmoral truths, Hobbesians do not use the term\n\u201cconstruction\u201d, but \u201chypothetical contract\u201d.\nHowever, many think of construction as a form of hypothetical\nprocedure akin to contract (Street 2010: 365; Darwall, Gibbard, &\nRailton 1997: 13, and see section 3. In\n 5.1\n and\n 5.2,\n we shall discuss two prominent varieties of constructivism whose\nscope is restricted to moral judgment; in\n 5.3\n other emerging varieties will be briefly presented.\n",
