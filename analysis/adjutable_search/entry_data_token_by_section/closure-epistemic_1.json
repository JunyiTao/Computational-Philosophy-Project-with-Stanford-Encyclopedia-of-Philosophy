    "main_text": "The Argument From the Analysis of Knowledge || Closure Fails Due to the Tracking Condition on Knowledge\n2.1 Closure Fails Due to the Tracking Condition on Knowledge\n\nIn rough outline, the first version involves defending say Dretske\u2019s\nor Nozick\u2019s tracking analysis of knowledge, then showing that it\nundermines K (versions of the tracking account are also\ndefended by Becker 2009, by Murphy and Black 2007, and by Roush 2005,\nthe last of whom modifies the tracking account so as to preserve\nclosure; for criticisms of Rouse see Brueckner 2012). We can skip the\ndefense, which consists largely in showing that tracking does a better\njob than competitors in dealing with our epistemic intuitions about\ncases of purported knowledge. We may also simplify the analyses.\nAccording to Nozick, to know p is, very roughly (and ignoring\nhis thoroughly discredited fourth condition for knowledge, criticized,\ne.g, in Luper 1984 and 2009 and in Kripke 2011), to have a belief\np which meets the following condition\n(\u2018BT\u2019 for belief tracking):\n\n(BT)\nwere p false, S would not believe\np.\n\n\nThat is, in the close worlds to the actual world in which\nnot-p holds, S does not believe p. The\nactual world is one\u2019s situation as it is when one arrives at the\nbelief p. BT requires that in all nearby\nnot-p worlds S fails to believe p. (The\nsemantics of subjunctive conditionals is clarified in Stalnaker 1968,\nLewis 1973, and modified by Nozick 1981 note 8.) On Dretske\u2019s view\nknowing p is roughly a matter of having a reason R\nfor believing p which meets the following condition\n(\u2018CR\u2019 for conclusive reason):\n\n(CR)\nwere p false, R would not hold.\n\n\nThat is, in the close worlds to the actual world in which\nnot-p holds, R does not. When R meets this\ncondition, Dretske says R is a conclusive reason for\nbelieving p.\n\nDretske pointed out (2003, n. 9; 2005, n. 4) that his view does not\nface one of the objections which Saul Kripke (2011, 162\u2013224; Dretske\nhad access to a draft circulated prior to publication) deploys against\nNozick\u2019s account. Suppose I am driving through a neighborhood in\nwhich, unbeknownst to me, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 barns are\nscattered, and I see that the object in front of me is a barn. I also\nnotice that it is red. Because I have barn-before-me percepts, I\nbelieve barn: the object in front of me is a (ordinary) barn\n(the example is attributed to Ginet in Goldman 1976). Our intuitions\nsuggest that I fail to know barn. And so say BT and\nCR. But now suppose that the neighborhood has no fake\nred barns; the only fake barns are blue. (Call this the red\nbarn case.) Then on Nozick\u2019s view I can track the fact that there is a\nred barn, since I would not believe there was a red barn (via my\nred-barn percepts) if no red barn were there, but I cannot track the\nfact that there is a barn, since I might believe there was a barn (via\nblue-barn percepts) even if no barn were there. Dretske said\nthat this juxtaposition, in which I know something yet fail to know a\nsecond thing that is intimately related to the first (there being a\nred barn, which I know, entails there being a barn, which I do not),\n\u201cis an embarrassment,\u201d and in this respect, he thought,\nhis view is superior to Nozick\u2019s. Let R, my basis for belief,\nbe the fact that I have red-barn percepts. If no barn were there,\nR would fail to hold, so I know a barn is there. Further, if\nno red barn were there, R would still fail to hold,\nso I know a red barn is there. So Dretske can avoid the\nobjectionable juxtaposition. Still, it is surprising that Dretske\ncited the red barn case as the basis for preferring his version of\ntracking over Nozick\u2019s. First, Dretske himself accepted juxtapositions\nof knowledge and ignorance that are at least equally bizarre, as we\nshall see. Second, Nozick avoided the very juxtaposition Dretske\ndiscussed by restating his account to make reference to the methods\nvia which we come to believe things (Hawthorne 2005). On a more\npolished version of his account, Nozick said that to know p\nis, roughly, to have a belief p, arrived at through a method\nM, which meets the following condition\n(\u2018BMT\u2019 for belief method tracking):\n\n(BMT)\nwere p false, S would not believe\np via M.\n\n\nIf no red barn were there I would believe neither that there was a\nbarn, nor that there was a red barn, via red-barn percepts.\n\n\nThird, the red barn case is one about which intuitions will vary. It\nis not obvious that I do know there is a red barn in the\ncircumstances Dretske sketches, which differ from those in Ginet\u2019s\noriginal barn case (where I fail to know barn) only in the\nstipulations that I see a red barn and that none of the barn simulacra\nare red. What is more, both Dretske\u2019s and Nozick\u2019s accounts have the\nodd implication that I know there is a barn if I base my belief on my\nred barn percepts yet I fail to know this if, in basing it on my barn\npercepts, I ignore the barn\u2019s color. Presumably the barn\u2019s color is\nnot relevant to its being a barn. \n\nThe tracking accounts permit counterexamples to K. Dretske\u2019s\nwell-known illustration is the zebra case (1970): suppose you are at a\nzoo in ordinary circumstances standing in front of a cage marked\n\u2018zebra\u2019; the animal in the cage is a zebra, and you\nbelieve zeb, the animal in the cage is a zebra, because you\nhave zebra-in-a-cage visual percepts. It occurs to you that\nzeb entails not-mule, it is not the case that the\nanimal in the cage is a cleverly disguised mule rather than a zebra.\nYou then believe not-mule by deducing it from zeb.\nWhat do you know? You know zeb, since, if zeb were\nfalse, you would not have zebra-in-a-cage visual percepts; instead,\nyou would have empty-cage percepts, or aardvark-in-a-cage percepts, or\nthe like. Do you know not-mule? If not-mule were\nfalse, you would still have zebra-in-a-cage visual percepts (and you\nwould still believe zeb, and you would still believe\nnot-mule by deducing it from zeb). So you do\nnot know not-mule. But notice that we have:\n\nYou know zeb\nYou believe not-mule by recognizing that zeb\nentails not-mule\nYou do not know not-mule.\n\n\nIn view of (a)\u2013(c), we have a counterexample to K, which\nentails that if (a) you know zeb, and (b) you believe\nnot-mule by recognizing that zeb entails\nnot-mule, then you do know not-mule,\ncontrary to (c).\n\nHaving rejected K, and denying that we know things like\nnot-mule, Nozick also had to deny closure across\nsimplification. For if some proposition p entails another\nproposition q, then p is equivalent to the\nconjunction p & q; accordingly, given closure across\nequivalence, which Nozick accepted, if we know zeb we can\nknow the conjunction zeb & not-mule, but if we also\naccept closure across simplification, we will be able to know\nnot-mule. \n\nIn response to this first version of the argument from the analysis of\nknowledge, some theorists (e.g., Luper 1984, BonJour 1987, DeRose\n1995) argued that K has great plausibility in its own right\n(which Dretske acknowledged in 2005: 18) so it should be abandoned\nonly in the face of compelling reasons, yet there are no such\nreasons.\n\nTo show there are no compelling reasons to abandon K, theorists\nhave provided accounts of knowledge that (a) handle our intuitions at\nleast as successfully as the tracking analyses and yet (b) underwrite\nK. One way to do this is to weaken the tracking analysis so\nthat we know things that we track or that we believe because we know\nthat they follow from things that we track (this sort of option has\nbeen turned against Nozick by various theorists; Roush defends it in\n2005, 41\u201351). Another approach is as follows. Knowing p is\nroughly a matter of having a reason R for believing\np which meets the following condition\n(\u2018SI\u2019 for safe indication):\n\n(SI)\nif R held, p would be true.\n\n\nSI requires that p be true in the nearby R\nworlds. When R meets this condition, let us say that\nR is a safe indicator that p is true.\n(Different versions of the safety condition have been defended; see,\nfor example, Luper 1984; Sosa 1999, 2003, 2007, 2009; Williamson 2000;\nand Pritchard 2007.) SI is the contraposition of CR, but\nthe contraposition of a subjunctive conditional is not equivalent to\nthe original.\n\nLet us suppose without argument that SI handles cases of\nknowledge and ignorance as intuitively as CR. Why say SI\nunderwrites K? The key point is that if R safely\nindicates that p is true, then it safely indicates that\nq is true, where q is any of p\u2019s\nconsequences. Put another way, the point is that the following\nreasoning is valid (being an instance of strengthening the\nconsequence):\n\nIf R held, p would be true (i.e., R\nsafely indicates that p)\np entails q\nSo if R held, q would be true (i.e., R\nsafely indicates that q)\n\n\nHence, if a person S knows p on the basis of\nR, S is in a position to know q on the\nbasis of R, where q follows from p.\nS is also in a position to know q on the basis of\nthe conjunction of R together with the fact that p\nentails q. Thus if S knows p on some basis\nR, and believes q on the basis of R (on\nwhich p rests) together with the fact that p entails\nq, then S knows q. Again: if\n\nS knows p (on the basis of R), and\nS believes q by recognizing that p\nentails q (so that S believe q on the basis\nof R, on which p rests, together with the fact that\np entails q),\n\n\nthen\n\nS knows q (on the basis of R and the\nfact that p entails q),\n\n\nas K requires. To illustrate, let us use Dretske\u2019s example.\nHaving based your belief zeb on your zebra-in-the-cage\npercepts, you know zeb according to SI: given your\ncircumstances, if you had those percepts, zeb would be true.\nMoreover, when you believe not-mule by first believing\nzeb on the basis of your zebra-in-the-cage percepts then\ndeducing not-mule from zeb, you know\nnot-mule according to SI: if you had those percepts\nnot only would zeb hold, so would its consequence\nnot-mule.\n\nLet us digress briefly in order to note that some versions of the\nsafety account will not uphold closure (Murphy 2005 presses this\nobjection against Sosa\u2019s version of the safety account). For example,\nat one point Ernest Sosa discussed the following version of the\ncondition:\n\nIf S were to believe p, p would be true.\n\n\nThis is to require that one\u2019s belief safely indicates its own\ntruth. However, it is entirely possible to be so situated that one\u2019s\nbelief safely indicates its truth even though the requisite condition\nis not met for something that follows from that belief. The point can\nbe illustrated with a version of the red barn case. Suppose that (on\nthe basis of my red-barn percepts) I believe red barn: there\nis a red barn in front of me. Suppose, too, that there is indeed a red\nbarn there. However (you guessed it) many fake barns are scattered\nthrough the neighborhood, all of which are blue, not red. In the close\nworlds in which I believe red barn, I am correct, so I meet\nthe requisite condition for knowing red barn, which is that\nmy believing red barn safely indicates its own truth. Now,\nred barn entails barn: there is a barn in front of\nme. But, according to the view on offer, the requisite condition for\nknowing barn is not that my belief red barn safely\nindicates that barn holds. What is required instead is that\nmy belief barn safely indicates its own truth.\nAssuming that I would believe barn if I saw one of the blue\nfakes, then my belief barn does not safely indicate its\ntruth.\n\nTo pick up the thread again: now, K fails if knowledge entails\nCR but not if knowledge entails SI, but it may not be\npossible to underwrite K merely by replacing CR with\nSI, since some other condition for knowledge might block\nclosure. We can underwrite closure if we assume that believing\np on \u201csafe\u201d grounds is sufficient for\nknowing p, but this assumption is dubious. As we have\nunderstood safety, we can believe things on safe grounds without\nknowing them. An obvious example is any necessary truth: because it\nholds in all possible worlds we can safely believe it for any reason.\nFor another example, recall the red barn case discussed earlier:\ndespite the many fake blue barns in the neighborhood, my red-barn\npercepts are safe indicators that the object in front of me is a barn\nand that it is a red barn, so no objectionable juxtaposition\n(such as I know there is a red barn but not there is a\nbarn) occurs, but some theorists will insist that, in the\ncircumstances sketched, I know neither that the object is a\nbarn nor that it is a red barn. \n",
