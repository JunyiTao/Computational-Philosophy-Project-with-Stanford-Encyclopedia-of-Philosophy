You might, for instance, have an aesthetic experience by\nwitnessing not a beautiful but a sublime storm. You might\nhave an aesthetic experience not by having a perceptual but rather by\nhaving an (imagined) emotional experience of the deep suffering of\nSethe expressed in Toni Morrison\u2019s great novel Beloved.\nPerhaps you might even have an aesthetic experience by appreciating\nthe way in which an elegant theorem reorganizes your thought about a\nmathematical structure.\n\nPhilosophical work on art and beauty in the Western tradition extends\nback at least as far as the ancient Greeks, but the concept of\naesthetic experience as such emerged in this tradition only in the\n18th century. Not all who work in this area take any form\nof experience to be the most fundamental concept for aesthetic theory;\nothers take evaluative aesthetic judgments, or the aesthetic value of\nobjects themselves, to be more basic in explaining the relevant\nphenomena. This entry discusses all those views in the Western\ntradition with any theory of aesthetic experience at all\u2014not\nonly those views that take aesthetic experience to be fundamental.\n\nPhilosophers use the idea of a distinctively aesthetic\nexperience for several different purposes. Some use it to defend deep,\neffortful engagement with the arts or art criticism (Shelley 1832\n[2003]). Some use it to give a substantive definition of art (Tolstoy\n1897 [2007]), or to elevate \u2018real\u2019 art over other cultural\nmedia (Collingwood 1938 [1958]). Some use it to argue for the personal\nor social importance of an education in sensibility (Schiller 1795\n[1989]). Others describe aesthetic experience as a special form of\ncognitive contact with the world, perhaps even with its fundamental\nmetaphysics (Schopenhauer 1818 [1958]). Only a few now question the\nutility of the concept of aesthetic experience (Shusterman 1997, 2008,\nNehamas 1998).\n\nGiven this diversity of purposes, it is difficult to say much about\naesthetic experience that is not controversial. But a few questions\ncan be posed for all theories of aesthetic experience. What is\ndistinctive about aesthetic experience? What is valuable about having\nan experience of this kind? How if at all, does it involve evaluating\nits own object? Who can have these experiences, and under what\nconditions? Does it make sense to say that we should have\nsuch experiences?\n\nThese questions will be answered on behalf of various different\napproaches to aesthetic experience in the course of this overview. The\noverview organizes such approaches along two dimensions: in terms of\nthe properties of an object on which such experience focuses; and in\nterms of various internal aspects of the experience itself.\n", "toc": [{"#FocuAestExpe": "1.

Focus of aesthetic experience\n\nAny aesthetic experience has intentionality: it is an experience (as)\nof some object. Typically, that object will be a work of\nart\u2014such as a sculpture, a symphony, a painting, a performance,\nor a movie\u2014or some aspect of nature, such as a bird\u2019s\nplumage, a cliff, or a bright winter morning. An aesthetic experience\nof an object with sensible features is commonly thought to be a\nperceptual experience of those sensible features. In the case of\npoems, novels, and certain pieces of conceptual art, the experience\nmight be understood as an imagined sensory experience; in the case of\nabstract or intelligible objects like theorems, it might be neither\nsensory nor imaginative in nature.\n\nIt is common to individuate aesthetic experience\npartly\u2014but typically not only\u2014in terms of the types of\nproperties on which this experience focuses. In perceiving a\nsculpture, for instance, you might experience its shape, its color,\nits resemblance to a real person, its placement in a gallery, its\nauthorship, or its representational style. Most think that aesthetic\nexperience as such focuses on only some of these properties, and\nperhaps even excludes focus on others.\n\nThis section analyzes the broad categories of properties of objects on\nwhich aesthetic experience has been said to focus: formal properties\nlike shape or composition; the powers things have to give us pleasure;\nproperties of meriting or deserving certain subjective responses;\nexpressive properties, especially those that express emotions; and\nfundamental metaphysical properties like essences or the nature of\nhumanity. It is consistent to individuate aesthetic experience by its\nfocus on more than one of these types of properties. The views\npresented under each subsection below are not mutually exclusive,\nexcept where explicitly stated.\n\nThis discussion largely treats these types of properties without\ndiscriminating between their presence in manufactured artworks vs.\naspects of nature. It will leave aside discussion of the comparative\nfundamentality of art and nature (cf. Hegel 1820\u201329 [1920];\nCroce 1938 [2007] p. 277; Adorno 1970 [1997] pp. 61\u20132; Wollheim\n1990 \u00a742\u20133; Savile 1982 Ch.8). It will also leave aside\ndiscussions of aesthetic experience that are solely focused on\naesthetic experience of nature (cf. Bullough 1912, Hepburn 1966,\nCarlson 1979, 2005, Budd 1996, Rolston 1998) or solely focused on\naesthetic experience of abstracta like theorems or proofs (cf.\nBaumgarten 1735 [1954], Hutcheson 1726 [2004], Schellekens 2022).\n1.1 Form and Function\n\nLong before the 18th-century development of special theories of\naesthetic experience, neo-Platonic medieval philosophers developed a\nconcept of beauty as rationally intelligible formal structure as it\ncould be appreciated in experience. In his fourth-century work De\nMusica, Augustine took beauty in music to be partly a matter of\nproportionality of parts, and later argued that visual beauty is\nformal harmony combined in the right way with color (Haldane 2013).\nNine centuries later, Thomas Aquinas (Summa Theologica)\nechoed this hylomorphic conception: the beautiful is material\nstructured in proper form, the kind \u201cof which apprehension in\nitself pleases\u201d (\u201cPulchrum dicatur id cujus apprehensio\nipsa placet,\u201d \u00a7 Ia, IIae, q.27, a.1 ad 3; as\ntranslated by Mothersill 1988, p. 323). In the Italian Renaissance,\nLeon Battista Alberti (1443\u20131452 [1988]) called beauty\n\u201creasoned harmony of all the parts within a body\u201d (Book 6,\n\u00a72 at p.156).\n\nIn the eighteenth century, attention to aesthetic experience per se,\nrather than beauty, grew out of a more general inquiry into\nperception. Alexander Baumgarten (1735 [1954]) first defined\n\u201caesthetics\u201d much more broadly as we do now\u2014as the\nscience of cognizing objects by sensory perception (from the Greek\n\u201caisth\u00easis\u201d for sensory perception).\nBaumgarten\u2019s work on the topic was heavily influenced by that of\nLeibniz (1684 [1969]) and Wolff (1719 [2003]). All three took pleasure\nmore generally to be sensory perception of an object\u2019s\nperfection; Wolff treated this as the coherence of the aspects of an\nobject either in themselves or as they work together to accomplish a\npurpose.\n\nThese early claims that experience of beauty is experience of form\nwere thoroughly integrated into the general theistic metaphysics and\nepistemology of these thinkers. Baumgarten, for instance, claimed that\nwe take pleasure not only in the perfection of an object, he wrote,\nbut also in being conscious of our own \u201cperfection of sensible\ncognition as such,\u201d in how we are suited to sense the world\n(1750 [2007] \u00a714; cf. Meier 1999 and Mendelssohn 1785 [1979]).\nThe contemporary English philosopher Anthony Ashbury Cooper, the Third\nEarl of Shaftesbury (1711 [2007]), took pleasurable admiration of\nwell-formed objects really to be admiration of the form-imposing\nminds, including those of the artist but ultimately that of the\ndivine. \u201cThe beautifying, not the beautified, is the really\nbeautiful,\u201d he wrote (Cahn and Meskin 2007, p. 80).\n\nImmanuel Kant\u2019s immensely influential Critique of\nJudgment (1789 [1987]) peeled aesthetic experience away from\napprehension of the divine, and cleaved the apprehension of form away\nfrom function. He claimed you make a pure judgment of\n(\u201cfree\u201d) beauty when you take pleasure just in perceiving\nthe form of an object without even conceptualizing its function.\n\nKant clearly contradicts his German predecessors in his claim that\n\u201cneither does perfection gain by beauty, nor beauty by\nperfection\u201d (\u00a716 at p. 78). Nonetheless, Kant does make two\nkinds of theoretical concessions to this tradition. First, he allows\nthat his German predecessors like Baumgarten may have confused\nperfection for a purpose with a subjective kind of purposiveness\nwithout reference to any specific purpose. This latter\n\u201cpurposiveness\u201d is difficult to understand, but Kant\nsuggests that it consists in the harmony of an object\u2019s parts,\nas presented in experience, that allows you to unite them in your\nimagination into a structured unity (\u00a715, p. 74; see Section\n2.3). Secondly, Kant concedes that we sometimes speak of\n\u201cbeauty,\u201d e.g. the beauty of a building, when we highlight\nhow something is perfect for its function. Kant calls this\n\u201caccessory beauty\u201d (or \u201cadherent beauty,\u201d\nanother translation of \u201cpulchritude adhaerens\u201d)\n(\u00a716 at p. 76).\n\nKant is often cited as a \u201cformalist\u201d\u2014someone who\nclaims that aesthetic experience focuses exclusively on formal\nproperties of objects\u2014but this is a matter of interpretive\ndispute. What is clear is that Kant offered a way into understanding\naesthetic experience\u2019s focus on form independently from its\nassociation with the divine or with any function that form might\nfulfill.\n\nMost German work on aesthetics in the nineteenth century moved away\nfrom focus on mere form to discuss the special knowledge that\naesthetic experience might afford (see Section 1.5). Interest in form\nwithout function saw resurgence in the final decades of the nineteenth\ncentury.\n\nIn The Birth of Tragedy (1872 [1992]), Friedrich Nietzsche\nargued that the artistic form of a tragedy\u2014its rhythm, its\nmusical shapes, its overarching structure\u2014could transfigure the\nfundamental facts of human suffering that would otherwise overwhelm\nand paralyze us. In such transfiguration by form, we come to take\n\u201caesthetic pleasure\u201d (\u00a724 at pp. 140\u20131,) in\nwhat would otherwise be horrible (cf. Bullough 1912 [2007]). Formal\nstructure produces a necessary, salutary illusion in our perception of\nterrible and otherwise unmanageable truths.\n\nThe influential Austrian music critic Eduard Hanslick argued in 1891\n[2007] that only pure form in music could be beautiful, and its lack\nof any \u201csubject\u201d was no discredit to it. In a partial\nreturn to Kant, George Santayana (1896) gave form a particularly\nimportant role to play in grounding beauty in all art forms. He said\nthat you can take self-conscious pleasure in synthesizing various\ndistinct perceptions of elements of an object to come to perceive it\nas a structured whole.\n\nIn response to the late 19th- and early\n20th-century development of abstract and\nnon-representational styles in the visual arts, a greater resurgence\nin formalism took place (Stolnitz 1960; Carroll 2013). The visual art\ncritic Clive Bell (1914 [2007]) took aesthetic experience to be a\nresponse to what he called \u201cSignificant Form\u201d in a piece\nof visual art, i.e. \u201carrangements and combinations that move us\nin a particular way\u201d to \u201caustere and thrilling\nraptures\u201d distinct from those feelings we encounter otherwise\n(p.264, 268). In contrast, the \u201crepresentative element\u201d is\nalways \u201cirrelevant\u201d to such aesthetic experience\n(p.27).\n\nA significant twist in the history of formalism came with John\nDewey\u2019s landmark 1934 [1980] book Art as Experience. In\nit, Dewey emphasized primarily that aesthetic experience was an\nexperience which itself had a unified, consummatory form with\nmeaningful development. Understood in this way, an aesthetic\nexperience can be an experience of any event or object which offers\nsuch a \u201csingle quality that pervades the entire experience in\nspite of the variation of its constituent parts\u201d (pp.\n305\u20136 as reprinted in Cahn and Meskin 2007). What it is for some\nexperience to be \u201cesthetic\u201d is not for it to be an\nexperience of some form, but rather for it to be an\nexperience that has an internal phenomenological structure that\nconstitutes its own form. You might have this kind of\nexperience at an exciting baseball game, watching a sunset, or writing\na paper.\n\nDewey\u2019s methodology had an outsized impact on aesthetics in\nanalytic philosophy. This impact even survived the influence of\nWittgenstein\u2019s later work (see 1953 [2009]), which many took to\nthreaten the possibility of phenomenological inquiry in general.\nDewey\u2019s turn towards the primacy of the form of\naesthetic experience\u2014rather than the form of an object\nof aesthetic experience\u2014can be found most notably in the work of\nMonroe Beardsley (1958 [1981], 1970 [1982]). Beardsley is known partly\nas a hedonist, because he thought that aesthetic experiences were\nnecessarily pleasurable or \u201cgratifying.\u201d But it is not\njust any gratification that counts towards an experience\u2019s being\naesthetic. Aesthetic experiences tend to gratifying because\nthey are intense, unified, complete experiences focused on single\nobjects whose features reward curiosity and active attention. It is\ntrue that only a certain kind of object of attention could offer such\na perceptual encounter\u2014but it is the form of the experience so\noffered that is explanatorily prior, rather than the form of the\nobject.\n\nFormalism has now fallen out of favor, and is generally regarded as an\nextreme view about aesthetic experience. There are a few common\nobjections to formalism as the view that aesthetic experience focuses\nexclusively on the formal properties of objects.\n\nSome try to undercut a central motivation for formalism: the\nmotivation to find a \u201ccommon denominator\u201d in all types of\naesthetic objects, both artefactual and natural (Carroll 2012).\nEspecially after Wittgenstein (1953 [2009]) challenged the possibility\nof providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the application\nof certain concepts, many philosophers of aesthetics thought that\ntrying to define \u201cart\u201d was a lost cause\u2014perhaps a\ncause antithetical to the radical \u201copenness\u201d (Weitz 1956)\nor \u201cessentially contested\u201d (Gallie 1956) nature of the\nconcept of art.\n\nFormalism crucially relies on the distinction between form and other\nfeatures of artworks, notably the content of artworks. But\nit\u2019s not clear how to draw a clean line between form and\ncontent, especially when it comes to art forms like instrumental music\n(Isenberg 1973). According to prolific Victorian critic Walter Pater\n(1873 [1986]), in music \u201cthe end is not distinct from the means,\nthe form from the matter, the subject from the expression; they inhere\nin and completely saturate each other,\u201d and it is the\n\u201cconstant effort of art to obliterate\u201d this distinction\n(p.86).\n\nA more specific version of this objection targets Bell\u2019s (1914\n[2007]) version of formalism. His theory relied not only on a\ndistinction between form and content, but also on an obscure\ndistinction between significant and insignificant form (Stolnitz 1960,\np.144).\n\nA third powerful line of criticism originated in work on the social\nstructures of aesthetic appreciation. Arthur Danto (1964) famously\nargued, with special reference to Andy Warhol\u2019s Brillo\nBoxes installation, that art can be formally indistinguishable\nfrom things that aren\u2019t art, and so whether something\ncounts as art cannot be a matter of its form, but must partly\nbe a matter of a certain kind of theory we apply. George Dickie (1974,\n1984) extended this idea to cover the claim that aesthetic\nappreciation per se is only available in the context of certain social\ninstitutions with their own patterns of value (see Guyer 2014c, p.\n479, for further criticism). Kendall Walton (1970) likewise argued\nthat the pleasure we take in an artwork\u2019s formal features\ndepends crucially on the category in which we perceive it.\n\nWhile a purely formalist approach to aesthetic experience might\neffectively mark what is distinctive about aesthetic experience, it\ndoes not readily explain what is valuable about aesthetic experience.\nEspecially when form is taken independently of function or\napprehension of the divine, it\u2019s not clear why it would even be\npleasant, let alone important, to have experiences that focus only on\nform. Dewey\u2019s (1934 [1980]) turn doesn\u2019t help here: is it\nall that valuable to have experiences with internal growth and a\nfeeling of consummation? Is this value great enough to justify all the\ntime and money we spend pursuing aesthetic experience?\n\nAlthough formalism has fallen from grace, even its critics accept the\nimportance of appreciating form among other features in aesthetic\nexperience (Carroll 2006, p. 78).\n1.2 Power to Please\n\nInfluential medieval philosophers like Augustine (De Musica)\nand Aquinas (Summa Theologica) conceived of beauty as a real\nand objective property inhering in objects themselves\u2014the kind\nof property whose nature does not depend on our capacity to experience\nit. In the eighteenth century, philosophers started to challenge this\nconception of beauty. Many posited a deeper metaphysical dependence\nbetween our capacity to have certain feelings and the properties on\nwhich those very experiences are focused: they took these properties\njust to be powers to produce certain pleasurable responses in us (cf.\nShelley 2010 on \u201cempiricism\u201d and de Clercq 2013 on\n\u201cexperiential accounts\u201d).\n\nAs James Shelley (\u201c18th Century British\nAesthetics\u201d) has pointed out, these views treat beauty as a\nLockean (1689) secondary quality (\u201cnothing in the objects\nthemselves, but powers to produce various sensations in us by their\nprimary qualities,\u201d Book I, Ch.VIII, \u00a710). Accordingly, the\nBritish empiricists tended to endorse such views of beauty and\nsublimity. Addison (1712 [1879]) drew the connection with \u201cMr.\nLock\u201d directly (letter no.413). Hutcheson (1726 [2004]) said\nbeauty was a capacity to \u201cexcite\u201d a certain type of\npleasure. Edmund Burke (1756 [2007]) called beauty \u201csome quality\nin bodies, acting mechanically upon the human mind by the intervention\nof the senses\u201d (in Cahn and Meskin 2007, p. 119). In his\nTreatise (1739\u201340 [1987]), David Hume called beauty as\n\u201cnothing but a form, which produces pleasure\u201d\n(II.1.8.2).\n\nThe empiricists and those they influenced gave similar treatments of\nthe sublime, another kind of feature typically introduced as a focus\nof aesthetic experience (contrast Kant 1789 [1987]; see following\nsection). Here the emphasis is less on a power to produce a certain\nfrisson of feeling, and more on the power to inspire a certain kind of\nmental activity, especially of the imagination. Joseph Addison (1712\n[1879]) treated \u201cGreatness\u201d as a \u201crude kind of\nMagnificence\u201d that offers our faculty of imagination the\npleasure of grasping at something it cannot capture in full (letter\nno.412). Burke (1756 [2007]), often cited as the originator of the\nidea of the sublime in Anglophone philosophy, considered the sublime\nto be that which would otherwise be painful and terrifying to behold,\nbut which is so distanced as to modify these feelings \u201cas not to\nbe actually noxious \u2026 [but] capable of producing delight\u201d\n(\u00a7VII). Influenced by reading Burke, Mendelssohn (1758 [1997])\ndefined the sublime as something that \u201ccaptures our attention\n\u2026 [and] arouses a sweet shudder that rushes through every fiber\nof our being\u2026 giving wings to the imagination to press further\nand further without stopping\u201d (pp. 196\u20137).\n\nSince these philosophers took aesthetic experience to focus on beauty\nand sublimity, and took these features to be powers to produce certain\nkinds of pleasurable mental responses, they thereby took aesthetic\nexperience to be experience of such powers to please. There need be\nnothing particularly troubling about the idea that you can experience\nan object\u2019s power to please in perception; this power can be\nexperienced precisely by being so pleased in such perception.\n\nThe view of beauty or sublimity as powers sometimes led the\nempiricists to deny that beauty or sublimity was really a feature of\nobjects themselves (Hutcheson 1726 [2004], Hume 1739\u201340 [1987]).\nThis was a substantive confusion, and was effectively called out as\nsuch by Thomas Reid. Reid (1785 [1969]) charged Hutcheson with\n\u201can abuse of words\u201d (p.782): it cannot be right to say\nthat beauty \u201cproperty denotes the Perception of some\nMind,\u201d since we talk of objects as having the property\nof beauty (Hutcheson 1726 [2004], p. 27). Contemporary commentators\nagree that there isn\u2019t anything suspect about an object\u2019s\ngenuinely having a property that is a power to produce certain mental\nresponses (Moran 2012; Sibley 1968). This worry has fallen away from\ncontemporary views that take beauty, sublimity, or aesthetic value to\nbe a matter of having a power to please\u2014and aesthetic experience\nto be experience of that power (e.g. Matthen 2017a, 2017b, 2018).\n\nThere are two serious issues for those views which take aesthetic\nexperience to be solely focused in on its object\u2019s powers to\nproduce certain responses in us.\n\nHere\u2019s the first issue. If the beauty, sublimity, or other\naesthetic value of an object O is just a power to produce\ncertain responses in us, and aesthetic experience is just a certain\nappreciation of such a power\u2014even one that involves actually\nhaving such a response\u2014then anything that has the power to\nproduce such a response in us should have the same beauty, sublimity,\nor other aesthetic value as O. But we do not typically take\nbeauty, sublimity, or aesthetic value to be so cleanly separable from\nits bearer. Many think that an aesthetic experience of\nO\u2019s properties is one that captures something utterly\nindividual in O, undetachable from the object it is (cf.\nSections 1.4.4 and 2.6). But any characterization of the kind of\nmental response which O has a power to produce, and which\nconstitutes O\u2019s beauty, sublimity, or aesthetic value,\nwill simply offer an (in principle) way to get the same aesthetic\nexperience elsewhere\u2014e.g. by appreciating a perfect forgery, or\na hallucinated object. This might seem unacceptable.\n\nThere are a couple of possible responses to this issue. Some (Budd\n1985; Davies 1994; Levinson 1996) simply deny that you really could\nhave the relevant type of experience in the absence of the relevant\nspecial object (cf. Shelley 2010). Another response is simply to\naccept that the relevant aesthetic experience and aesthetic value can\nbe had elsewhere, and to explain away intuitions that this should not\nbe possible (Peacocke 2021).\n\nThe second problem is harder to dismiss, and it calls for a more\nfundamental reorientation towards the focus of aesthetic experience.\nIt takes very little for an object to have a mere power to\nplease, even a power to please via perception of its features. If all\nit took for an object to be beautiful or sublime was for it to have\nsome such power, we should take individual experiences of such\npowers\u2014individual instances of being so pleased\u2014to be\ndemonstrative of such aesthetic value in objects. But we typically do\nnot take reports of such experience to be so demonstrative. Instead,\nthe pleasure an individual takes in an object is usually taken to be\ncontestably relevant to its aesthetic value. Whether that pleasure\nattests to an object\u2019s power to please is beyond dispute, but\nwhether it attests to an object\u2019s beauty, sublimity, or\naesthetic value is often disputed.\n\nThis fact troubled Hume in his later writing on aesthetics. In his\nseminal essay \u201cOf the standard of taste,\u201d Hume (1757\n[1987a]) subtly amended his Treatise\u2019s (1739\u201340\n[1987]) view of beauty (cf. Nehamas 1981, Cavell 1965 [2007]). What is\n\u201cfitted by nature to produce those particular feelings\u201d of\npleasurable liking, and thus is in a sense genuinely beautiful, is\nthat which draws univocal and lasting approval from \u201ctrue\njudges\u201d\u2014ideally sensitive, practiced, and unprejudiced\ncritics of the arts. This view of beauty still entangles it\nconstitutively with experience, but with a crucially idealized\nrestriction (cf. De Clercq 2013 on \u201cresponse dependent\nproperties\u201d at p. 305). This restriction anticipates, but does\nnot itself yet reach, a more fundamental shift in approach to the\nfocus of aesthetic value brought about by Kant: an approach that takes\naesthetic experience to involve an attribution of a merited\nresponse.\n1.3 Merit\n\nAt the end of the eighteenth century, philosophers turned away from\nviews that took aesthetic experience to focus only on objects\u2019\npowers to produce pleasure. This seems to have taken place largely due\nto the influence of Kant\u2019s 1789 [1987] Critique of\nJudgment. There he distinguished the merely\nagreeable\u2014things which we simply like, e.g. because they satisfy\nour appetites\u2014from the beautiful. In doing so, he took it that\nan aesthetic experience of an object\u2019s free or pure beauty\ninvolves pleasure felt to be merited by the object so\nperceived (\u00a79). To have that response is to feel as though the\nobject deserves that very response you give it.\n\nThis is meant to make better sense of the way we discuss aesthetic\nexperiences and what we take to be authoritative on the matter of\nbeauty. To take pleasure in an aesthetic way in an object,\nKant thought, is just to engage your mental faculties of imagination\nand understanding in a pleasant free play with the form of the object\nyou perceive, unconstrained by thought of any real purpose that the\nobject might serve or any appetite it might satisfy (see Sections 2.3\nand 2.5). But any perceiver has these mental faculties, and must see\nthe same form in the object, and so (claimed Kant) aesthetic\nexperience involves a further thought that everyone ought to\ntake such pleasure in this object.\n\nOn this view of aesthetic experience, what you take to be merited is\nnot (just) a judgment about the aesthetic quality of an\nobject presented in perception. Kant is emphatic that what seems\nmerited to you, in having an aesthetic experience, is a\nfeeling, a form of pleasure. This is so in the case of beauty\nbut also in the case of the sublime (contrast the empiricists from the\nprevious section). The \u201cmathematically sublime\u201d is that\nwhich cannot be captured in full in our imagination, but about which\nwe can nonetheless reason, like infinitude itself. The\n\u201cdynamically sublime\u201d is that which looks to have total\npower over us\u2014like a massive storm or other monstrous aspects of\nnature\u2014but which we can nonetheless resist with the power of our\nown practical reason. In each, we feel pleased that our minds can\novercome limitations.\n\nThis is not a return to those thinkers (Augustine De Musica,\nAquinas Summa Theologica) who thought that aesthetic\nexperience was a direct apprehension of some inherent property of an\nobject, like its being well-formed for its function, or symmetrical in\na way that reflects the divine. According to Kant, beauty isn\u2019t\nstrictly speaking a property of objects (even though we speak as\nthough it is), and we aren\u2019t even tempted to attribute sublimity\nitself to objects. The focus here is pleasure in the powers of\nuniversal mental capacities themselves. Part of Kant\u2019s\ninnovation in aesthetics consists in the suggestion that objects might\ndeserve certain subjective responses.\n\nThis idea is not easy to understand, and many have done significant\ninterpretive and substantive philosophical work attempting to explain\nhow an object could deserve a subjective feeling (see e.g. Mothersill\n1988; Eaton 2001; Hamawaki 2006; Moran 2012; Cavell 1965 [2007];\nGinsborg 2015; Gorodeisky 2019, 2021). One approach here is to\ninterpret the pleasure in question as not just a phenomenal tone (see\nLabukt 2012, Bramble 2013) but rather as a kind of liking or\npro-attitude which, like other attitudes, could be suited or\n\u2018fitted\u2019 to its intentional object (Gorodeisky 2019, 2021;\nKriegel forthcoming; compare Hume 1757 [1987a]).\n\nDespite this difficulty, the idea that aesthetic experience involves a\nfocus on how an object merits a certain response has pervaded recent\ndiscussion. There\u2019s an important distinction to be made here\nbetween what it is to take aesthetic experience to involve (what feels\nlike) merited pleasure or admiration per se (Scruton 1974, Sibley\n1974, Walton 1993), and what it is to feel pleasure in or simply to\nlike some object when you have an otherwise merited kind of\nexperience of it (Beardsley 1970; Matthen 2017a, 2017b,\n2018). The challenge of making sense of what it is to merit a certain\nsubjective feeling of pleasure does not face this latter claim in the\nsame way, as we can make sense of how an artwork merits a general\nexperience in terms of that experience\u2019s accuracy, its\ncontextualization, or even how it matches the intentions of the artist\nwho created an object (Wimsatt and Beardsley 1949; Wollheim 1990).\n\nOne line of research pulls the idea of a merited response apart from\nKant\u2019s claim that the beautiful and the sublime universally\nmerit the same feelings across people. In his magnum opus In\nSearch of Lost Time (originally published 1913\u20131927),\nMarcel Proust (1913\u20131927 [2003]) suggested that an individual\nlike his narrator Marcel might feel an individualized, personal demand\nfor a feeling or an emotion from a certain scene or piece of artwork.\nPartly in response to Proust, and in resistance to Kant, Richard Moran\n(2012) and Nick Riggle (2016) have given substantive characterizations\nof the personal demands that artworks and natural scenes can make upon\nus (cf. Nussbaum 1990, Ch.13; Landy 2004, Chs. 1 and 3; Nehamas\n2007).\n\nThere is a challenge facing any theory that takes aesthetic experience\nto focus exclusively on objects\u2019 meriting certain pleasurable\nsubjective responses. It is possible to see that Michelangelo\u2019s\nstatue of David merits admiration, or that the view over Waimea Canyon\nmerits awe, without yourself feeling admiration or wonder in that\nmoment (cf. Moran 2012 on Proust 1913\u20131927 [2003]). Assuming\nthat other substantive restrictions can be met here (e.g. the demand\nfor disinterested attention; see Section 2.5), would this count as an\naesthetic experience? If so, it\u2019s not clear entirely what would\nbe valuable about it, even if it does involve a positive evaluation of\nits object. Some might say that you have gotten something right: you\nare correct in thinking that the statue merits admiration and the view\nmerits awe. It\u2019s not clear that this correctness would be enough\nto make sense of the great value of aesthetic experience.\n\nIt seems best to say here that this would not count as an aesthetic\nexperience because it does not bear the value of actually\ninvolving a subjective response that is itself of value. But this\ncould lead to trouble with dissociation in the other direction, which\nis also clearly possible: you could have a pleasurable experience\nas of some object\u2019s meriting that very kind of\npleasurable experience, while also being incorrect that it merits\nthat. If the value of aesthetic experience rests exclusively or\nprimarily on the value of the pleasure itself, then it seems that this\ninappropriate experience should share almost all the value that a\nmerited aesthetic experience would have. That, to some, is\ninconceivable (Budd 1985; see Shelley 2010, Peacocke 2021 for further\ndiscussion).\n\nThe view that aesthetic experience focuses primarily on object\u2019s\nmeriting certain positive responses can also clash with other\nintuitions about the nature of aesthetic experience. Some think that\nan experience should be counted as aesthetic even if it involves a\nnegative evaluation of its object: \u201can abominable performance of\nthe London Symphony is as aesthetic as a superb one \u2026\nThe symptoms of the aesthetic are not marks of merit,\u201d wrote\nNelson Goodman (1968 [1976], p. 255).\n1.4 (Emotional) expression\n\nA third view takes aesthetic experience to be focused on expressive\nproperties of objects. An expressive property of an object is a\nproperty by which it expresses something\u2014usually an emotion or\nother affect, but more rarely an attitude, a movement, a personality,\nor a way of experiencing the world as a whole.\n\nConsider how this kind of view differs from those discussed in the\nlast three subsections. Although certain forms can be expressive,\nexpressive properties in general are not just the same as formal\nproperties: something might have a deeply expressive coloration with\nvery simple, unexpressive form, like Rothko\u2019s famous color field\npaintings. It is a matter of substantive dispute (to be described\nbelow) whether expressive properties are the same as powers\nto make perceivers feel certain ways, or properties that\nmerit certain mental responses in perceivers.\n\nRegardless of the answers to these questions, two positions need to be\ndistinguished. One is the position that having an aesthetic experience\nessentially or necessarily involves some emotion. The other is the\nposition that aesthetic experience is essentially, primarily, or\nparadigmatically experience of expressive properties of its\nobject. These claims do not necessarily come together. This section\ndiscusses the latter claim (see Section 2.4 for discussion of the\nformer).\n\nThere are roughly four kinds of views of expression endorsed by those\nwho take the primary focus of aesthetic experience to be expressive\nproperties of an artwork (or, more rarely, of nature; see Croce 1902\n[1992], 1938 [2007]; Wollheim 1968 [1980]). These differ according to\ntheir conceptions of how expression takes place, and what it means for\nthe experience both of the creator and of the appreciator of an\nartwork. These are transfer views, projection views, correspondence\nviews, and transformation views (for alternative taxonomies, see\nMatravers 2013 and Levinson 2006).\n\nDebates about the nature of expression and its importance to aesthetic\nexperience are still lively (Matravers 1998, Robinson 2005, 2011, Gaut\n2007, Kivy 1989, 2002, Boghossian 2002, 2010, 2020, Nussbaum 2007,\nMontero 2006a-b, Cochrane 2010, Wiltsher 2016; for overviews see Kania\n2013 and Matravers 2007, 2013).\n1.4.1 Transfer\n\nThe first kind of view is the simplest, but it offers the least\nexplanation of expression. A simple transfer view of expression takes\nit that some inner state or event of the creator is simply shared via\nexperience of the artwork to the observer\u2014i.e. the spectator,\npercipient, or reader. What is expressed on this kind of view is\nusually an emotion or feeling, but it is sometimes a whole perceptual\nexperience or an entire way of seeing the world.\n\nIn the 1802 [1984] preface to his Lyrical Ballads, the poet\nWilliam Wordsworth identified poetry (which, on his view, could\ninclude prose) as \u201cthe spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings\n\u2026 emotions recollected in tranquillity\u201d after having been\nfelt in all their heat previously by the poet (p.611; cf. Dewey 1934\n[2007], p. 312). The reader of a poem shares this feeling, learns\nabout this feeling, and thereby feels a pleasant communal feeling with\nthe author. Perhaps the greatest champion of this view was the Russian\nnovelist Leo Tolstoy, who in 1897 [2007] defined art as that\n\u201chuman activity\u201d by which \u201cone man consciously, by\nmeans of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has\nlived through, and that other people are infected by these feelings\nand also experience them\u201d (in Cahn and Meskin 2007 at p. 237).\nSomeone who undergoes an aesthetic experience of art, then, will feel\na \u201cjoy and spiritual union\u201d not only with its creator, but\nalso with those others who experience it (p.239).\n\nThe transfer theory of emotional expression often associates this\ntransfer with an intermediate clarificatory step, and offers as part\nof a theory of the value of aesthetic experience that it offers not\njust emotional experience but a certain organized knowledge of what\nemotions feel like from the inside. In his lectures on aesthetics in\n1819\u201333 [1984], Friedrich Schleiermacher argued that artists\nconceive of works that both communicate their own emotions to the\naudience and clarify them in so doing (p.11). The painter and curator\nRoger Fry moved away from his friend Clive Bell\u2019s formalism as\nhe endorsed it in his early work (\u201cArt and Life,\u201d 1917\n[1981]) to claim that art rouses emotion in us in a specifically clear\nway, cut off as they are from motivating us to specific action in our\nown lives (\u201cEssay in Aesthetics\u201d 1909 [1981],\n\u201cRetrospect\u201d 1920 [1981]).\n\nThe transfer theory of expression of emotions is not particularly\npopular, largely because it seems that an artist need not feel those\nemotions she expresses in a work, and that the audience need not\nthemselves feel those emotions expressed in a work (cf. Langer 1953;\nStolnitz 1960; Matravers 2013). Moreover, different spectators tend to\nfeel quite different emotions in response to an artwork, so it\u2019s\nnot clear that art should be understood fundamentally in terms of\ntransferring just those emotions the creator had (Stolnitz 1960 p.\n186; Wimsatt and Beardsley 1949). Others take the focus on the emotion\nthat an artist felt to distract from the artwork itself (Stolnitz\n1960, p. 164).\n\nAnother kind of transfer theory focuses on transfer not of emotion but\nof sensory experience from creator to consumer. The critic John Ruskin\n(1843\u201360 [2004]) claimed that the true artist (e.g. the painter\nJ.M.W. Turner) could communicate precisely what it is like to have a\ncertain perceptual experience the artist had, by \u201cproducing on\nthe far-away beholder\u2019s mind precisely the impression which the\nreality would have produced\u201d (pp. 86\u20138). The French\nnovelist Marcel Proust\u2014who was a deep admirer of\nRuskin\u2014added that not only could aesthetic experience involve\nthe appreciation of one episode of subjective experience, but it could\nalso involve the appreciation of the artist\u2019s total and unique\nway of experiencing the world, as a kind of subjective personality\n(for discussion, see Landy 2004; compare V\u00e9ron 1879, Stolnitz\n1960 p.161ff.). One\u2019s act of writing, then, can be understood as\na \u201csecretion of one\u2019s innermost life \u2026 that one\ngives to the world\u201d (1895\u20131900 [1984], p. 79). The\ndenouement of his great novel In Search of Lost Time involves\nthe recognition on the narrator\u2019s part that\n\nart, if it means awareness of our own life, means also awareness of\nthe lives of other people \u2026 it is the revelation, which by\ndirect and conscious methods would be impossible, of the qualitative\ndifference, the uniqueness of the fashion in which the world appears\nto each one of us, a difference which, if there were no art, would\nremain for ever the secret of every individual (Time Regained\nin 1913\u20131927 [2003], p. 299).\n\n\nArthur Danto (1981) echoes this idea in his claim that\n\u201cexternalization of the artist\u2019s consciousness, as if we\ncould see his way of seeing and not merely what he saw,\u201d is an\nessential part of expressiveness in art (p.164). This, too, is a way\nof making available to an appreciator a subjective state\u2014but a\nmore general subjective stance on the world, a way of experiencing it\nas a whole, rather than just an individual emotion.\n1.4.2 Projection\n\nProjection views derive largely from mid-19th century to\nearly 20th century psychological thought about\n\u201cempathy,\u201d which was originally called\n\u201cEinf\u00fchlung\u201d in the German (Lipps 1903\u20136,\ntranslated to \u201cempathy\u201d by Titchener 1909 [1926]). Empathy\ntheorists took it that aesthetic experience involves mentally (or\nperhaps even mystically; Vischer 1873 [1994], p. 104) projecting\nourselves into the physical shape of an item to have an emotional or\ndynamic experience of the kind that a human subject would have if she\ntook on that physical shape. In the 1850s, Hermann Lotze (1885\n[1899]) claimed that a shape can \u201ctransport\u201d us\ninside of it \u201cand make us share its life\u201d (quoted by Lee\n& Anstruther-Thomson 1912, pp. 17-18). As Robert Vischer (1873\n[1994]) wrote, \u201cI can think my way into [an object], mediate its\nsize with my own, stretch and expand, bend and confine myself to\nit\u201d (pp. 104\u20135). The Swiss art historian Heinrich\nW\u00f6lfflin (1886) agreed that \u201cwe submit all objects to\nsoulification\u201d in this projective way, and suggested that such\nprojection involved actual workings of the \u201cmotor nerve\nsystem.\u201d\n\nThis view takes it that aesthetic perceivers attribute feeling to\nobjects, but partly by relating them closely to oneself. The\nphilosopher Theodor Lipps (1935) insisted that the \u201cinner\nimitation\u201d involved in empathy involved feeling that the emotion\nin question is felt as belonging to the object perceived\u2014but\nsince you feel \u201centirely and wholly identical\u201d with the\nobject in this context, you feel that emotion as belonging to yourself\ntoo. The English novelist Vernon Lee (real name Violet Paget) co-wrote\na work with her lover and fellow author Clementina Anstruther-Thomson\n(1912) in which they claimed that we attribute \u201cto lines and\nsurfaces, to the spatial forms, those dynamic experiences which we\nshould have were we to put our bodies into similar conditions\u201d\n(pp. 20\u20131).\n\nLater on, the psychologist Herbert Sidney Langfeld offered an analysis\nof The Aesthetic Attitude (1920) in terms of empathy, and\nmade several innovations to the theory as it stood: he noted that the\ncapacity for empathy varies across people (p.133), and that sometimes\nwe project motion onto a shape not by feeling as a human in that shape\nwould feel, but rather by feeling how one who produced that gestural\ntrace would feel (p.122).\n\nThese theorists disagreed on some points, for example: whether such\nprojection was voluntary (Vischer, Langfeld) or involuntary\n(W\u00f6lfflin, Lipps 1935); whether the emphasis of one\u2019s\nexperience is on feeling oneself as identical to the object\n(Lipps 1935 p. 298, Puffer 1905 pp. 12\u201313) or on the\nobject as it might feel were it human (Vischer p. 92,\nW\u00f6lfflin p. 4, Lee & Anstruther-Thomson p. 17); whether the\nemotions in question literally involved any physical bodily activation\nof the perceiver\u2019s nervous system (W\u00f6lfflin, Puffer 1905,\nLangfeld) or not (Lipps 1935); and whether such projection needed to\nbe based on actual remembered emotion or motion of the body (Lee &\nAnstruther-Thomson, Langfeld) or not (Vischer, W\u00f6lfflin, Lipps\n1935, Puffer 1905). But these disagreements pale in the face of the\nbroad consistency of these theories.\n\nFirst: none placed any particular emphasis on the mental, bodily, or\nemotional states of the creator of an object\u2014just on the\nfeatures of an object that made it amenable to the projective\nidentification involved in empathy. Beautiful things, they tended to\nagree, were those things most amenable to this identification that\nwould then offer pleasure (in this way, some of these theories also\nhave ancestors in those who took beauty to be a power to please; see\nSection 1.2). The pleasure to be had in these contexts is thought by\nthese theorists to be universally accessible (Vischer), as a joy taken\nin the \u201cliveliness\u201d (Lipps 1903\u20136 p. 102) of\nobjects, the lessening of loneliness (Vischer), or in particular in\nthe naturally harmonious (Puffer 1905) or intrinsically salutary (Lee\n& Anstruther-Thomson) condition into which such empathic\nidentification puts an observer\u2019s body. In the psychological\ncontext in which they wrote, they were not all exclusively concerned\nwith aesthetic experience per se, although they applied it to\narchitecture and the visual arts (Lipps 1903\u20136, 1935, Puffer\n1905, Lee & Anstruther-Thomson, Langfeld).\n\nRemarkably, these theorists are generally content to make claims about\nidentification and attribution of emotion that sound paradoxical to\nthe 21st-century ear (Goodman 1968 [1976], p. 243; Wollheim\n1968 [1980]). Partly due to the oddity in literally attributing\nemotions to objects or identifying with them, newer descendants of\nthis view focus instead on engagement from the imagination. Levinson\n(2006b) has claimed that you imagine a fictional \u201cpersona\u201d\nin music who is expressing the emotions she really has, and Walton\n(1988, 1994) says you imagine of your own actual experience\nof a work of art that it\u2019s an experiencing of real emotions (see\nMatravers 2013, p. 410, for objections).\n1.4.3 Correspondence\n\nThere is a difference between (i) experiencing certain feelings\nsuggested by a shape\u2019s affinity with a bodily position and (ii)\nexperiencing that very affinity itself. The former simply exploits a\nresemblance in eliciting a feeling experienced as being\n\u2018in\u2019 the object, whereas the latter kind of experience\ntakes as its focus that very resemblance relation. Those who endorse\ncorrespondence theories of expression, and take expressive properties\nto be the focus of aesthetic experience, understand aesthetic\nexperience as belonging to the latter kind. These correspondence\ntheories tend to treat aesthetic experience as fundamentally a matter\nof understanding a meaning that certain artworks already have in\nvirtue of their manifest correspondence with certain aspects of human\nsubjective experience\u2014which correspondence is experienced as\nsuch.\n\nAfter the resurgence of formalism in the early twentieth century,\nseveral philosophers started to think about form as having\nsignificance not just in itself but in the way it manifestly resembled\nor corresponded to emotion (e.g. Fry 1981). The philosopher to develop\nthis view most significantly was Susanne Langer, whose two influential\nbooks Philosophy in a New Key (1942) and Feeling and\nForm (1953) focused on music, poetry, and dance (for commentary\nsee Danto 1984). Music itself, she claimed, bears a \u201cclose\nlogical similarity to the forms of human feeling \u2013 forms of\ngrowth and attenuation, flowing and stowing, conflict and resolution,\nspeed, arrest, terrific excitement, calm, or subtle activation and\ndreamy lapses\u201d (1953, p. 27). This is a \u201cpattern of\nsentience,\u201d the form which lived phenomenal subjectivity of\nfeeling shares with music. Since music itself has this form, it has\n\u201cimport\u201d or significance as well: it \u201cexpresses life\n\u2013 feeling, growth, movement, emotion and everything that\ncharacterizes vital existence\u201d (1953, p. 82).\n\nAccording to Langer, this is not just a matter of conventional\nsymbolization, nor a matter of transmission of the life or feelings of\na creator. What the artist felt in making something, and indeed what\nyou yourself feel when you see it, is mostly beside the point. To the\nextent that there is a phenomenological feeling that pervades\naesthetic experience generally, it should be understood as a\n\u201cpervasive feeling of exhilaration\u201d (p.395). In\naesthetic experience a feeling is \u201cnot\n\u2018communicated,\u2019 but revealed; the created form\n\u2018has\u2019 it, so that perception of the virtual\nobject\u2014say, the famous frieze from the Parthenon\u2014is at\nonce the per\u00adception of its amazingly integrated and intense\nfeeling\u201d (1953, p. 394). Far from erasing the comparison,\naesthetic experience (or \u2018intuition\u2019) makes plain to us,\nin an intellectually satisfying way, how space can mirror sentiment:\n\u201cWhat it does to us is to formulate our conceptions of feeling\nand our conceptions of visual, factual, and audible reality together.\nIt gives us forms of imagination and forms of\nfeeling, inseparably\u201d (p.397).\n\nRichard Wollheim is well known for formulating this subtle aspect of\n\u2018expressive perception\u2019 in several books and essays\n(notably 1968 [1980], 1990, 1994). He treated art objects as\nmeaningful pieces of the physical world to be understood by spectators\nas physical objects which artists themselves intended to be perceived\nin a certain way. These are, and indeed are intended to be, expressive\nof the actual internal life of the artist. But an internal mental\ncondition can only be expressed by an art object via that\nobject\u2019s correspondence to the relevant condition, i.e. that\nproperty of \u201cseem[ing] to us to match, or correspond with, what\nwe experience inwardly\u201d (p.21) in that condition. In an\naesthetic experience of such an art object, the object is seen (or\nheard, or felt) as corresponding in this way to a certain\nfeeling, in a way that involves a spectator\u2019s feeling the\nrelevant feeling herself (cf. Wollheim 1994; see Budd 2008, Noordhof\n2008, Galgut 2010). This is not a matter of \u201creading off\u201d\nthe feeling from the artwork as you might decode an unfamiliar diagram\n(1980 \u00a729, p. 39ff), but rather participating in a certain\npractice of meaning-making and meaning-interpretation which he labels\na \u201cform of life\u201d (after Wittgenstein 1953 [2009]), and\nwhich allows us to literally experience emotion and inner life\nin artworks.\n\nOther views exploit correspondence, and our experience of\ncorrespondence as such, in different ways. Roger Scruton (1974)\nnotably analyzed aesthetic experience in terms of seeing as\n(cf. Wittgenstein 1953 [2009], 1958 [1965]), and stressed in a way\nsimilar to Wollheim that both a perceptual aspect and an aspect of\n\u2018thought\u2019 that can attribute emotion to what is seen are\ninseparable aspects of one and the same experience (p.117ff.). At\nbase, such \u2018seeing as\u2019 is only available when we notice a\ncertain resemblance which we exploit via an act of the imagination to\nhear something like a falling melody as sad (Chs.8\u20139).\nIn contrast with Wollheim, though, Scruton claimed the relevant\nresemblance was between the experience of an artwork and the\nexperience of the emotion, not the artwork itself and the experience\nof the emotion (p.127; for amendments to his view, see his 1999, pp.\n140\u2013170).\n\nBy definition, all correspondence views of expression will claim that\nan experience of an expressive property (aesthetic or not) involves\nexperiencing the correspondence relation itself. In this\nregard correspondence views are distinct from nearby theories.\nChristopher Peacocke\u2019s (2009) view of expression, for instance,\nis a view on which you can hear music metaphorically as sad\nby exploiting, but not by consciously representing or experiencing, an\nisomorphism between music and sadness. This isomorphism might make a\ndifference to subpersonal representational processes, and thereby come\nto causally affect the phenomenology of the experience of sadness in\nthe music, but the relation itself is not experienced, on this\nview.\n\nDespite their differences, the correspondence views of Langer,\nWollheim, and Scruton all agree on one crucial point: the relevant\nexperience of correspondence is not one that can be decomposed into\nstrictly separable aspects, one of what is \u2018strictly\u2019\nperceived and another added element of what is expressed via what is\nseen. According to all, an experience can be one of correspondence,\nbut in a particularly integrated and indecomposable way.\n\nCorrespondence views of expression\u2014which, by definition, take it\nthat you understand an expression partly by experiencing or noticing\nthe correspondence relation itself\u2014are still popular\n(Budd 1995, Kivy 1989, Davies 1994), and still vigorously debated\n(Peacocke 2009, Matravers 2013, Davies 2006, Levinson 2006b).\n1.4.4 Transformation\n\nTransfer, projection, and correspondence views of expression all share\n(at least) one key commitment\u2014the commitment to the idea that\nthe kinds of emotions or mental states expressed in art are one and\nthe same as the kinds of emotions or mental states experienced in\nordinary life. But those philosophers most closely associated with the\nview that aesthetic experience is focused on expressive properties did\nnot make this commitment. Instead, they took expression to transform\nthe nature of a feeling, and took the art-making process to be\ninextricably bound up with the nature of this transformation\n(Bosanquet 1892 [1904]; Ducasse 1929, p. 111; Dewey 1934 [1980];\nCassirer 1944, pp. 142\u20135).\n\nThe British philosopher Bernard Bosanquet propounded an early version\nof this view in his 1892 [1904] History of Aesthetic. He\nclaimed that expression of content through form\u2014and especially\nof emotion\u2014is the ultimate aim of any artwork. That content or\nemotion is fundamentally bound up with its \u201cembodiment\u201d in\nthe artwork, \u201cattached, annexed, to the quality of some object\n\u2013 to all its detail\u201d (p.4). The process of expression\n\u201ccreates the feeling in creating its embodiment, and the feeling\nso created not merely cannot be otherwise expressed, but cannot\notherwise exist, than in and through the embodiment which imagination\nhas found for it\u201d (p.34). While John Dewey (1934 [1980]) thought\nthat aesthetic experience could be enjoyed in various ordinary life\ncircumstances, he considered art intrinsically expressive as the\n\u201cvery operation of creating, by means of new objects, new modes\nof experience \u2026 It enables us to share vividly and deeply in\nmeanings to which we had been dumb\u201d (p.248).\n\nThe philosopher who most systematically developed the view of\nexpression as transformation was R.G. Collingwood, whose\nPrinciples of Art (1938 [1958]) drew deeply from Benedetto\nCroce\u2019s work (1902 [1992], 1938 [2007]). Croce considered\nexpression fundamental to aesthetic experience, and considered\naesthetic experience to be one of the most fundamental modes of\ncognitive interaction with the world (compare Baumgarten 1735 [1954]).\nExpression, for Croce, was not a matter of communication; it was a\nmatter of organizing fleeting impressions into a clarified, meaningful\nwhole, and as such it can happen purely in the mind of an individual\n(e.g. a single artist). A work of art, then, is not to be considered\nany public manifestation, but rather a mental item, a\n\u201ctheoretical form\u201d to be \u201cconvert[ed] into words,\nsong, and outward shape\u201d (1938, in Cahn and Meskin 2007,\np.272).\n\nCollingwood (1938 [1958]) left aside Croce\u2019s unusual metaphysics\nand philosophy of mind, but retained and elaborated much of what he\nsaid about the nature of expression. Real art just is a matter of\nexpression, and expression is an internal process directed at your own\nfeelings. It involves clarifying those feelings in a way that releases\nyou from their dominating influence on your thought and action (pp.\n109\u201310). To express a feeling is to attend wholly to a\nparticular affect-laden fleeting impression, to \u201cstabilize and\nperpetuate it as an idea\u201d in a Humean sense (p.218). In\nattending in this way, you come to consciousness of your feeling, but\nyou thereby also transform it: though \u201cThere is emotion there\nbefore we express it \u2026 as we express it, we confer upon it a\ndifferent kind of emotional colouring; in one way, therefore,\nexpression creates what it expresses\u201d (p.152). Collingwood gives\nthe somewhat unusual label \u201cImagination\u201d to \u201cthe new\nform which feeling takes when transformed by the activity of\nconsciousness\u201d (p.218). Insofar as art simply is expression, it\nis the production not of some object in the physical world, nor even\n\u201ca \u2018form\u2019, understood as a pattern or a system of\nrelations between the various noises we hear or the various colours we\nsee,\u201d but an episode of \u201ctotal imaginative\nactivity,\u201d which asserts the mastery of the self over feeling\n(p.142).\n\nImportantly for Collingwood, a consumer-side experience of an\nartist\u2019s expression is not to be understood as the reception of\na transferred feeling, or as the interpretation of a meaningful symbol\nor sign. Instead, it is a repetition of what the artist herself has\nalready done:\n\nIf a poet expresses, for example, a certain kind of fear, the only\nhearers who can understand him are those who are capable of\nexperiencing that kind of fear themselves. Hence, when some one reads\nand understands a poem, he is not merely understanding the\npoet\u2019s expression of his, the poet\u2019s, emotions, he is\nexpressing emotions of his own in the poet\u2019s words, which have\nthus become his own words. As Coleridge puts it, we know a man for a\npoet by the fact that he makes us poets. We know that he is expressing\nhis emotions by the fact that he is enabling us to express ours.\n(p.118)\n\n\nThis conception puts certain limitations on what aesthetic production\nand spectator-side aesthetic experience can do. Expression cannot be\nintended at the level of the individual feeling, as it isn\u2019t\nclear before expression what feeling is affecting you\n(p.111). What\u2019s more, a feeling when expressed is not purged\nfrom the mind, only recognized for what it is, and controlled\n(p.110).\n\nCollingwood\u2019s view is complicated and often obscure, but\nsecondary literature has elucidated it somewhat. Hopkins (2017) claims\nthat the clarification and freedom that expression offers comes from\nplacing a raw feeling imaginatively into a modal profile, thereby\nprojecting how it would shift with changes in objective circumstances.\nThis can affect the feeling itself in the moment, just as\nunderstanding the square projective shape in front of you as the face\nof a cube can affect the phenomenology of your visual experience of\nthat shape.\n\nThere is an elusive quality to the expression views of Croce,\nCollingwood, and their contemporaries: it is not easy to understand\nthe kinds of transformation, embodiments, or objectifications of\nfeelings that they take expression to involve. But the basic idea that\na feeling expressed in an artwork is thereby transformed in a way\ninextricable from the work itself has proven enduringly popular\n(Stolnitz 1960, p. 169; Sircello 1972, 1975; compare Budd 1985, Davies\n1994, Levinson 1996c, and Shelley 2010; see Wollheim 1980, p. 76ff.,\nMatravers 2013, and Tormey 1971 [1987] for criticism).\n1.5 Fundamental Nature\n\nThe idea that aesthetic experience offers acquaintance with aspects of\nnature has a deep history. Medieval philosophers treated it as a means\nof knowing the divine. Several of those eighteenth-century\nphilosophers who focused on appreciation of form (see Section 1.1)\nthought form was itself a reflection of God\u2019s creative\npower.\n\nThe association between the arts and truth has an even longer history,\ntracing at least back to Aristotle\u2019s claim in the\nPoetics that (good) drama represents possibilities for human\nlife. Many philosophers have argued that the arts offer acquaintance\nwith emotions by expressing emotions (Section 1.4.), and many have\nargued that they offer acquaintance with moral truths (Ruskin\n1843\u201360 [2004]; Cousin 1854 [1873]; Nussbaum 1990; McMahon 2018;\nsee Landy 2012 for criticism). A significant new trend in\nphilosophical aesthetics also incorporates more cognitive content\ngenerally into the focus of aesthetic experience (see Carroll 2002,\n2006, 2015, Goldman 2013, Peacocke 2021). This section will not cover\nall such views, but only those that treat aesthetic experience as a\nmeans to acquaintance with or knowledge of fundamental facts about the\nstructure of the world and our place in it.\n\nThis claim is systematically defended in three historical contexts:\nRomanticism, post-Kantian German Idealism, and the\n20th-century intersection of existentialism and\nphenomenology.\n1.5.1 Romanticism\n\nThe English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in his critical and\nphilosophical essays published together as Biographia\nLiteraria (1817 [1907]), treated imagination as essential to\nartistic creation and aesthetic experience\u2014but fundamentally as\na source of knowledge rather than an empiricist faculty of association\nor a way of entertaining fantasies. In a proto-Idealist vein, he\nclaimed that such knowledge was knowledge of the spirit that grounds\nreality itself, and to which we ourselves belong as individual loci of\nspirit (cf. Guyer 2014b, p. 65). In Germany, the poet-philosopher\nJohann Christian Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin (1795 [1963]) wrote that\naesthetic experience could lead the mind to construct a unity out of a\nmessy space of intuition, which unity mirrored the unity of spirit\ninherent in the metaphysical fabric of the world itself.\n\nA retrospective reverence for the ancient Greek arts was a touchstone\nof the Romantics, who thought its pursuit of beauty precisely allowed\nit to attain \u201cobjectivity.\u201d The English poet John Keats\nconcluded his famous Ode on a Grecian Urn (1820) with these\nlines (46\u201350):\n\nWhen old age shall this generation waste,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe\n\nThan ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say\u2019st,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBeauty is truth, truth beauty\u2014that is all\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ye know on earth, and all ye need to\nknow.\u201d\n\n\n(For criticism of Keats on this point, see Ruskin 1843\u201360\n[2004]). The German philosopher Friedrich Schlegel made this claim\nexplicitly in his essay \u201cOn the Study of Greek Poetry\u201d\n(1795). He thought Sophocles composed terrific tragedy effortlessly,\njust by letting the harmonious structure of nature flow through him\ninto his drama.\n\nThe Romantics thought that aesthetic experience offered acquaintance\nwith a concrete individual sometimes called \u201cthe\nAbsolute\u201d\u2014either the infinite itself, or some particular\nconcrete individual within nature that somehow reflected the whole\nunified spirit of the universe. As Schlegel (1798\u20131800 [1991])\nput it, \u201cone might believe [Romantic poetry] exists only to\ncharacterize poetical individuals of all sorts; and yet there is still\nno form so fit for expressing the entire spirit of an author \u2026\nIt alone can become, like the epic, a mirror of the whole\ncircumambient world, an image of the age\u201d (\u00a7116, pp.\n31\u20132). This acquaintance with a concrete individual was\ncontrasted with conceptualized or descriptive understanding.\n\nAlthough these various Romantic poets and philosophers thought\naesthetic experience was the best way to achieve acquaintance with the\ntrue fundamental nature of the universe, they also took on a certain\npessimism or \u201cirony\u201d about the extent to which this could\nreally be achieved. The thematization of limitations on our knowledge\nin the context of aesthetic attempts to know the harmonious unity of\nthe world is a common feature of Romantic writing.\n1.5.2 German Idealism\n\nThe systematic theories of German Idealism and the proposals of\nRomanticism permeated one another, especially in the work of Friedrich\nSchelling. His System of Transcendental Idealism (1800\n[1978]) claimed that both the beautiful and the sublime gave us\nawareness of a fundamental conflict between unconscious (but\nnonetheless mental or spiritual) nature and the conscious\n\u201cinfinity\u201d of human freedom. The sublime makes us aware of\nthis terrible conflict directly, and the beautiful offers the\ntemporary apparent reprieve from or resolution of this conflict. In\nhis later Philosophy of Fine Art (1802\u20133 [1989]), he\ndenied that art offered \u201csensual stimulation, as recreation, as\nrelaxation for a spirit fatigued by more serious matters\u201d (in\nCahn and Meskin 2007, p. 170). Instead, \u201ctruth and beauty are\nmerely two different ways of viewing the one absolute,\u201d where\nthe beautiful offers acquaintance with \u201cthe essential forms of\nthings\u201d via concrete particulars, and philosophical theorization\noffers knowledge of the same via general principles (pp. 178,\n173).\n\nArthur Schopenhauer\u2019s metaphysics in The World as Will and\nRepresentation (1818 [1958]) picks up a significant piece of\nSchelling\u2019s system. He expanded on Schelling\u2019s claim that\n\u201cWill is primal being\u201d by claiming that all of fundamental\nreality is a matter of will. What aesthetic experience offers us is\ndirect, intimate acquaintance with essences: \u201cwhat is thus known\nis no longer the individual thing as such, but the Idea, the\neternal form, the immediate objectivity of the will at this\ngrade\u201d (\u00a734 at p. 195).\n\nSchopenhauer sometimes speaks as though we can choose to have an\naesthetic experience by a \u201cconscious and violent tearing away\nfrom the relations of the same object to the will\u201d (\u00a739,\np.202); the \u2018genius\u2019 artist in particular is good at doing\nthis. When we \u201cdevote the whole power of our mind to\nperception\u201d of an object, we can come to forget our own\nwill\u2014which is itself a pleasant thing, for our will is\nconstantly either bored with its own satisfaction or pained by its\nfrustration (\u00a734, pp. 178\u20139).\n\nAt other points, Schopenhauer presented aesthetic experience as a\npassive result of experiencing great art, especially the art of tragic\ndrama. In tragedy, he wrote,\n\nthe terrible side of life is presented to us\u2026 and so that\naspect of the world is brought before our eyes which directly opposes\nour will \u2026 we become aware that there is still left in us\nsomething different that we cannot possibly know positively, but only\nnegatively, as that which does not will life \u2026 it\nraises us above the will and its interest, and puts us in such a mood\nthat we find pleasure in the sight of what directly opposes the will.\n(p.433)\n\n\nOutside of aesthetic experience, we can only know the nature of the\nuniverse by a kind of extrapolation. Schopenhauer thus puts aesthetic\nexperience in a place of priority with respect to philosophy\nitself.\n\nOn this last point he was directly opposed by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich\nHegel, whose system of historical development developed in\nThe Phenomenology of Spirit (1807 [1979]) and his\nlectures on aesthetics and fine art (1820\u201329 [1920]) published\nposthumously. According to him, the point of art is to come to\nunderstand the fundamental, minded nature of the world\u2014the\n\u201cspirit\u201d to which we all belong as self-conscious,\nrational, self-determining beings. Hegel considered a mode of\nunderstanding fundamental nature to be more advanced the more that it\nabstracts from concrete sensuous presentation and the more that it can\nturn contemplation back onto itself. There is a scale within types of\nart in this respect; visual art is less advanced than music, which is\nitself less advanced than poetry (1807 [1979]). While self-conscious\nRomantic poetry allows us to see our rational self-determining nature\nas minded beings, it nonetheless remains imperfect as a mode of\nknowledge of spirit. Philosophy, in its endless capacity for\nself-conscious reflection, \u201cis a higher mode of\npresentment\u201d (in Cahn and Meskin 2007, p. 181) and can\nultimately supplant art as a mode of knowing the world\u2019s\nessential structure.\n\nThis Hegelian consequence is not a happy one, and it is a serious\ndrawback of treating art as revelatory of the structure of the\nuniverse: its pits aesthetic endeavors in competition with scientific\nand philosophical ones themselves (Poe 1850 [1984], Gotshalk 1947\np.8).\n1.5.3 Existentialism and Phenomenology\n\nSchelling\u2019s (1800 [1978]) account of the inherent conflict\nbetween \u201cunconscious\u201d nature and the\n\u201cconscious\u201d free human subject had a great influence on\nphenomenologists and existentialists who wrote about aesthetic\nexperience in the early to mid-20th century.\n\nIn his influential essay \u201cOn the Origin of the Work of\nArt\u201d (1935 [1971]), the phenomenologist Martin Heidegger\ninitially objected to the centrality of the \u201cmuch-vaunted\naesthetic experience\u201d to point out that the \u201cthingly\naspect\u201d of an artwork is essential to what it does for us (in\nCahn and Meskin 2007, p. 345). But it turns out that he is really only\nobjecting to a certain abstracted, perhaps Hegelian or neo-Hegelian\nconception of aesthetic experience, rather than all experience of art\nconsidered as special. He gives his own account of our experience of\nart, one on which art offers acquaintance with the basic, essential\nnature of our own human subjectivity. Our primary experience of the\nphysical objects around us foregrounds their utility to us\u2014what\nHeidegger had previously called their \u201creadiness-to-hand\u201d\n(Being and Time, 1927)\u2014rather than their physicality;\nthings only stand out as the clumps of matter they are when they fail\nin serving us in the way we expect them to, as when a tool breaks. It\nis art that allows us to step back from this mode of experiencing\nobjects to contemplate that very phenomenological mode of\nreadiness-to-hand itself, and how it struggles against blunt physical\nconstraints. A work of art, then, sets up a\n\u201cworld\u201d\u2014roughly, a way of experiencing\nthings\u2014as it emerges from its physical basis (the\n\u201cearth\u201d). Through experiences of art, we come to see this\nstruggle itself. Heidegger uses the example of a Van Gogh painting of\nworn, dirty peasant shoes and a Greek temple to exemplify how these\nways of \u201cbeing\u201d emerge from physical things in their\n\u201cthingliness.\u201d Heidegger defines art as \u201cthe\nbecoming and happening of truth\u201d as a form of\n\u201cunconcealedness:\u201d it brings to the foreground our ways of\nexperiencing the world and how they clash with physicality.\n\nThe French atheist existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre studied with\nHeidegger and with the founding phenomenologist Edmund Husserl. The\nview of aesthetic experience that emerges from his novel\nNausea (1938 [1965]) is one that draws from both of their\nconceptions of the physical world as fundamentally devoid of meaning.\nThe world and all of \u201cexistence\u201d as it is in itself\nindependently of human agency is absurd enough to inspire a form of\nnausea in the narrator, Antoine Roquentin. This absurdity consists in\nthe facts that: things happen contingently and for no particular\nreason; no life has any narrative unity; and there is no patterned\nstructure to the unfolding of events one after another.\n\nWhat the experience of art is needed to do is to bring any order,\nstructure, and meaning to human life. In a series of scenes in which\nRoquentin hears the music of a particular jazz vocalist, he comes to\nfind in music the necessity, purpose, and internal structure the world\nhad lacked:\n\nIt seems inevitable, the necessity of this music is so strong \u2026\nIf I love that beautiful voice, it is above all because of that: it is\nneither for its fullness nor its sadness, but because it is the event\nwhich so many notes have prepared so far in advance, dying so that it\nmight be born. \u2026 something has happened. (38)\n\n\nFrom Roquentin\u2019s ecstatic listening we can extrapolate a theory\nof an experience of art and why it is so essential to us. Art\nexercises human freedom to structure the world and give it meaning and\na sense of purpose or necessity; it offers to those who appreciate it\na form of aesthetic experience that makes the world feel whole and\nnecessary. By extrapolating from Sartre\u2019s writing of\nNausea itself, we can also see that art can give us\nacquaintance with the very absurdity of existence itself, and\nchallenge us to make something meaningful of ourselves. In What is\nLiterature? (1948 [1967]) Sartre called writing a way of\n\u201cimposing the unity of mind on the diversity of things\u201d\nthat serves our \u201cneed of feeling that we are essential in\nrelationship to the world\u201d (p.27). The creation and appreciation\nof art, then, not only offers knowledge of the nauseating fundamental\nabsurdity in existence, but also offers at least a phenomenological\ncure for it.\n\nNot all in Sartre\u2019s group were so optimistic (nor all so\npessimistic about the meaning in the world; consider Sartre\u2019s\nChristian contemporary Marcel 1951 [1960]). Albert Camus (1942), for\ninstance, thought that absurdity was inescapable, and all you could do\nwas defy it and go on living anyway (cf. Nagel 1971). Later critical\ntheorists who were deeply influenced by the existentialists took a\nmore complicated stance. In Aesthetic Theory (1970 [1997]),\nTheodor Adorno claimed that artworks offer fantasies of escape from\nthe material world by imposing a new form upon its matter, but only in\na way that involves rejecting their material origin. \u201cAesthetic\nexperience,\u201d then, \u201cis that of something that spirit may\nfind neither in the world nor in itself; it is possibility promised by\nits impossibility\u201d (pp. 135\u20136).\n\nThis concludes the survey of the various different types of properties\non which philosophers have variously claimed aesthetic experience\nfocuses. Note that it is consistent to claim that aesthetic experience\nis focused on more than one of these types of properties. In an\nimportant turn in mid-20th-century aesthetics, Frank Sibley\n(1959) argued that there was a heterogeneous class of aesthetic\nproperties\u2014including beauty, sublimity, elegance, charm, and\nvarious expressive properties\u2014on which aesthetic experience\nfocused (for discussion see Matravers 1996, Brady and Levinson 2001).\nSome contemporary philosophers draw from multiple traditions to\ncharacterize aesthetic experience (Carroll 2002, 2006, 2015, Levinson\n1996a-d, 2016b, Stecker 2005, Goldman 2013, Peacocke 2021). Views of\naesthetic experience that diffuse focus onto several different types\nof properties of objects are under correspondingly more pressure to\nclarify what is special about aesthetic experience in other terms.\n2. Mental aspects of aesthetic experience\n2.1 Pleasure\n\nAlmost all agree that pleasure is a typical aspect of aesthetic\nexperience (for exceptions see Carroll 2006, Adorno 1970 [1997]). But\nnot all agree that it is an essential or even necessary aspect of\naesthetic experience (those who do not include Levinson 1996c, Stecker\n2005, and Peacocke 2021).\n\nIs it possible to explain the source of such pleasure in aesthetic\nexperience? It\u2019s not obvious that it should be possible,\nespecially on the view that art has no function and aesthetic\nexperience no further purpose (see Section 2.5). One option is simply\nto delineate the particular type of pleasure that makes aesthetic\nexperience what it is\u2014and thereby count on an\ninterlocutor\u2019s recognition of that type of\npleasure\u2014without explaining its source. In the\n\u201caestheticist\u201d or \u201cart for art\u2019s sake\u201d\nmovement amongst Romantic poets and essayists (Gautier 1835\u20136\n[2005], Poe 1850 [1984], Baudelaire 1857 [1965], Pater 1873 [1986];\nfor overview see Guyer 2014b, Ch.6), many took this particular stance,\nespecially to rebel against those (like Ruskin 1843\u201360 [2004])\nwho took the point of art to be moral in nature.\n\nIt is more common, however, to claim that aesthetic experience\ninvolves pleasure taken in some further aspect of aesthetic\nexperience. There are a few distinct proposed sources of pleasure in\naesthetic experience. First, we might take pleasure in positive\nevaluation of an object or its creator. Second, we might enjoy the\nactivity of our own minds, including the free play of our faculties.\nThird, we might feel joyful relief in being liberated, at least\ntemporarily, from certain practical pressures or domination. Fourth,\nwe might take pleasure in coming to know or understand something in\naesthetic experience. Fifth, and finally, we might take pleasure in a\nspecial connection to others made available in aesthetic experience in\nparticular.\n\nVarious theories of aesthetic experience combine these claims in\nconsistent ways; it is possible to think that there are several\ngrounds for the total pleasure involved here. Note also that\nit\u2019s consistent to take pleasure to be a necessary aspect of\naesthetic experience without claiming (i) that pleasure makes\naesthetic experience what it is, (ii) that pleasure is the\npoint or aim of aesthetic experience, or (iii) that\nan object\u2019s power to produce pleasure in us is the focus of\naesthetic experience. (For discussion of this last claim, see Section\n1.2 above).\n\nPerhaps most popular is the claim that aesthetic experience involves\npleasure because (and insofar as) it involves a positive evaluation of\nan object in some respect (see also Sections 1.1 and 1.3). The idea\nhere is that we take pleasure in an object\u2019s intrinsic value,\nits suitedness to function, its power to produce a certain kind of\nexperience, or even in the goodness and skill of its creator\n(including, perhaps, the divine).\n\nTo compliate matters, pleasure can be understood in at least two ways:\nas a phenomenological feeling with a certain positive \u201chedonic\ntone,\u201d or as a kind of pro-attitude with positive content (see\nLabukt 2012, Bramble 2013). On the former definition, it\u2019s not\nclear that any positive evaluation of an object should\ninvolve a positive frisson of feeling (Peacocke 2021, pp.\n173\u20134). Given that we can begrudgingly, enviously, or otherwise\ngrumpily attribute genuine value to things in other contexts, why\nshould positive evaluation in aesthetics necessarily involve a\npositive hedonic tone? On the latter definition, it might trivially\nfollow that aesthetic experience involves pleasure (as a pro-attitude)\nif it involves positive evaluation, but this claim has limited\ninterest. Recent work in aesthetic normativity has done significant\nwork to make sense of a combination of the two (Gorodeisky 2019, 2021;\nKriegel forthcoming).\n\nA second common claim is that pleasure in aesthetic experience derives\nfrom a biologically natural joy we take in the activity of our own\nmental faculties. This position was especially popular in the\neighteenth century among those philosophers who thought of the mind\nfundamentally in terms of a limited number of faculties like\nsensation, imagination, understanding, and reason (Baumgarten 1735\n[1954], Meier 1999, Schlegel 1795 [2001], 1798\u20131800 [1991]).\nThis view also has its own contemporary proponents (Levinson 1996b, p.\n13).\n\nThe claim that we take pleasure in mental activity can be readily\ncombined with the thought that aesthetic experience involves an\nevaluation, especially as it involves a (positive) evaluation of our\nown minds (Baumgarten 1735 [1954], Mendelssohn 1758 [1997], Feagin\n1983). But this can seem too much focused on the perceiver or\nappreciator rather than the object of aesthetic experience itself.\n\nA famous version of this second claim derives largely from Kant (1789\n[1987]), who argued that we take pleasure in the free play of\nour mental faculties. This pleasure has a substantive aspect, but it\nalso has a privative aspect. In the absence of a concept we apply to\nsome object of perceptual representation, our imagination and\nunderstanding are liberated from the strictures of rational,\ndiscursive thought about the things we encounter in experience. This\nliberation is itself joyful. Some philosophers, notably Friedrich\nSchiller (1795 [1989]), thought this mental liberation was the single\nfundamental source of pleasure in aesthetic experience (cf. Matherne\nand Riggle 2020).\n\nThis relates closely to a third proposed source of pleasure in\naesthetic experience: liberation from certain practical thought and\nemotion in aesthetic experience. Schopenhauer (1818 [1958]) took it\nthat the basic condition of human practical life was a painful one: as\nwilling creatures, we are constantly vacillating between frustration\nof our desires and boredom in the satisfaction of them. What aesthetic\nexperience offers us is a reprieve from such suffering, a way to\nbecome a \u201cpure will-less, painless, timeless\nsubject of knowledge\u201d (\u00a734, p. 179; cf. Schelling\n1800 [1978]).\n\nInfluential modern theories focused on liberation from the influence\nof unexpressed emotions. R.G.C. Collingwood (1938 [1958]) in\nparticular thought that all experience of \u201cart proper,\u201d\nwhether as creator or appreciator involves expression of an emotion,\nand that all such expression involves clarification and transformation\nof a feeling into something whose murky domination you can now resist\nin a way you couldn\u2019t before (see Section 1.4.4 above).\n\nCollingwood explicitly distinguishes his view from another kind of\nview that takes pleasure in aesthetic experience to be a matter of\nrelease. This other view makes a process of \u201ccatharsis\u201d\ncentral to some or all aesthetic experience. Catharsis is an\nAristotelian concept; Aristotle himself used it to explain the\npleasurable release from tension we feel after a tragic drama raises\nemotions of pity and fear in us (Poetics). But it is not\nentirely clear what catharsis is.\n\nA fourth proposed source of pleasure in aesthetic experience is the\npleasure of gaining knowledge or understanding. Those who take\naesthetic experience to involve, essentially, a form of acquaintance\nwith fundamental aspects of nature tend to attribute pleasure in this\nway. But any broadly epistemic approach to aesthetic experience can\nattribute pleasure to this source, even if the knowledge or\nunderstanding gained by aesthetic experience is not necessarily of\nfundamental metaphysics. Nelson Goodman (1968 [1976]), for instance,\ntook aesthetic experience to be an encounter with a meaningful\nsymbolic object. He rejects all attempts \u201cto distinguish the\naesthetic in terms of immediate pleasure \u2026 The claim that\naesthetic pleasure is of a different and superior quality is\nnow too transparent a dodge to be taken seriously\u201d\n(p.242\u20133). But he nonetheless notes that \u201cwhat delights is\ndiscovery,\u201d so there\u2019s pleasure involved here (p.258).\n\nFinally, some trace pleasure in aesthetic experience to connection\nwith other people. This claim is particularly associated with those\nwho treat aesthetic experience as focused on expressive properties\n(see Section 1.4. above). The pleasure we take in communing with\nothers can be a matter of connecting with an artist and her own inner\nlife (Wordsworth 1802 [1984], Vischer 1873 [1994], Proust\n1913\u20131927 [2003]), or a matter of connecting with others who\nwould react to an object in the same distinctively aesthetic ways we\ndo, or both (Tolstoy 1897 [2007]).\n2.2 Conceptualization\n\nOne traditional line of thought in aesthetic theory takes it that\naesthetic experience of an object excludes conceptual thought about\nwhat kind of thing that object is. This was central to Kant\u2019s\n(1789 [1987]) view; he thought that the imagination and the\nunderstanding could engage in a \u201cfree play\u201d in aesthetic\nexperience precisely because no conceptual binding restricted the way\nan object presented itself to us in this context.\n\nThe same idea has been central to vastly different theories of\naesthetic experience too. After Croce (1902, 1938), Collingwood (1938\n[1958]) denied that an emotion could be conceptualized in the\nexpression essential to aesthetic experience because conceptual\n\u201cdescription generalizes \u2026 Expression, on the contrary,\nindividualizes\u201d (112). The idea that conceptualization is\ngeneralization, and so incompatible with the focus on the\nparticular demanded by aesthetic experience, is an enduring\none (see e.g. Sibley 1974, 1983). Theodor Adorno (1970 [1997]) claimed\nthat artworks offer the promise of escape from worldly\nconceptualization, although he also argued that this promise is\ninevitably broken, given that artworks are themselves aspects of the\nreal world.\n\nEven those who take aesthetic experience to be a mode of cognitive\ncontact with the world often distinguish it from other cognitive modes\nin terms of its incompatibility with conceptualization. The Romantics\n(see Section 1.5.1. above) thought that the \u201cabsolute,\u201d or\nthe total infinite substratum of reality, could be experienced in a\nconcrete individual, but not by conceptualization. Nelson Goodman\n(1968 [1976]) treated aesthetic experience as a matter of\nunderstanding objects that present their subjects in an analog way\n(with what he calls \u201csyntactic density, semantic density, and\nsyntactic repleteness,\u201d p. 252), where this contrasts sharply\nwith the conceptual mode of representation offered by natural\nlanguages.\n\nOn the other hand, various philosophers have argued that\nconceptualization is positively necessary to aesthetic\nexperience.\n\nScruton (1974) took a form of \u201cunasserted\u201d conceptual\nimagination to be central to the \u201cseeing-as\u201d and\n\u201chearing-as\u201d (etc.) of aesthetic experience. In this\nScruton was influenced by Wollheim, but Wollheim\u2019s (1968 [1980],\n1990, 1994) reliance on conceptualization in aesthetic experience\nplausibly runs deeper than Scruton\u2019s. To have an aesthetic\nexperience of an artwork in particular is, in part, to\ninterpret it, and to interpret an artwork is in part to\nattribute certain intentions concerning that very experience to the\nartist who made it (1987, p. 8; for a famous criticism of this claim,\nsee Wimsatt and Beardsley, 1946). This attribution of intentions\nsurely involves conceptualization, insofar as intention itself\ndoes.\n\nA similar interpenetration of thought and experience undergirds\nWalton\u2019s (1970) famous argument that an aesthetic experience of\nan artwork necessarily involves assigning that work to a category. The\nexpressive chaos of Picasso\u2019s Guernica would not seem\nchaotic at all if it belonged to a genre of \u201cGuernicas\u201d\nwhich tended to be much more brashly colored and three-dimensional; in\nthat context, it would seem flat, muted, even gentle. In a rare entry\ninto aesthetics, p. F. Strawson (1966) once argued that aesthetic\nappraisal\u2014itself plausibly a part of aesthetic\nexperience\u2014must involve conceptualization of a work of art\nas such, in order to focus attention on just those features\nrelevant to such appraisal (for critical discussion, see Sibley 1974\nand Wollheim 1980).\n2.3 Imagination\n\nIt\u2019s an old idea (Addison 1712 [1879], Burke 1756 [2007]) that\nimagination is essentially involved in aesthetic experience. But\ndifferent philosophers mean vastly different things by\n\u201cimagination\u201d here.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, the imagination was conceived by both\nempiricists and rationalists as one of the few fundamental mental\nfaculties (alongside others like sensation and reason). As such, it\nplayed various different roles in the mental system. One of those\nroles was to take up and combine the raw material offered by sensation\ninto more sophisticated representations available in the absence of\nindividual objects there to be sensed.\n\nAs Kant put it, the imagination \u201csynthesiz[es] the manifold of\nintuition.\u201d In ordinary (non-aesthetic) experience, it does so\naccording to rules or schema provided by the understanding, which\ncorrespond roughly to what we consider concepts today. In an\nexperience of a beautiful object or scene, however, the imagination is\ngiven no such rules, and engages in a \u201charmonious\u201d form of\n\u201cfree play\u201d with the faculty of understanding without\nbringing the object presented in experience under any particular\nconcept whatsoever (see also Section 2.2. above).\n\nAlthough it is hard to say exactly what such \u201cfree play\u201d\nis (cf. Ginsborg 1997, Matherne 2016, K\u00fcplen 2015, Savile 2020),\nthe idea that aesthetic experience crucially involves such free play\nof the imagination has been a vastly influential one (see Guyer 2014\nfor a comprehensive approach to the history of this thought). It is\nclosely allied with the idea of beauty as a form of unity in variety\n(Hutcheson 1726 [2004]), and the idea that we enjoy the activity of\nour own mental faculties in aesthetic experience (see Section 2.1.\nabove). As Benedetto Croce summarized it, it is the idea that\n\u201caesthetic activity fuses impressions into an organic\nwhole\u2026 the synthesis of variety, or multiplicity, into\nunity\u201d (1902 [1992], p. 21). Such play is meant to involve the\nsubject as an agent, and it is meant to be pleasurable in part due to\nthe freedom it gives to the imagination. This is disputable: as the\nnovelist-philosophers Vernon Lee and Clementina Anstruther-Thomson\n(1912) put it, \u201cwe do not take pleasure in playing because\nplaying makes us feel free; but, on the contrary, we get greater and\nmore unmixed pleasure while playing, because we are free to \u2026\naccommodate our activity to our pleasure\u201d (pp. 6\u20137).\n\nThis kind of mental play should be carefully distinguished from other\nforms of play associated with aesthetic experience that also\nconstitutively involve imagination (e.g. Spencer 1855 [1895], Groos\n1896\u20139 [1901]). For example, Walton (1990) has influentially\ntreated our aesthetic engagement with various fictions as a form of\nmake-believe game involving imagination as constrained by certain\nkinds of prescriptions given by the structure of a story or a picture\n(cf. Groos 1898 on a \u201cself-conscious illusion,\u201d pp.\n302\u20133). This is structured, game-like play; Walton intends us to\nunderstand what we do with such aesthetic objects on the model of what\nkids do with toys. It is also often a purely \u2018internal\u2019\nplay, one that doesn\u2019t manifest in further bodily action. But it\nis a form of play undergirded by the imagination not as a synthetic\ncapacity to structure a mess of impressions, but rather undergirded by\nthe imagination as a more general creative capacity, one that allows\nus to entertain vividly things which are not currently present to our\nsenses.\n\nThis now more common conception of the imagination also informs those\notherwise various and disparate views which take aesthetic experience\nto extend beyond what is immediately given in perception. The English\nRomantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (1832 [2003]) defined poetry as the\nexpression of imagination, where the imagination is just \u201cmind\nacting upon \u2026 thoughts so as to color them with its own light,\nand composing from them as from elements, other thoughts, each\ncontaining within itself the principle of its own integrity\u201d\n(p.674). Arthur Schopenhauer (1818 [1958]) thought that the\nimagination of the artist was required to go beyond what is literally\nperceived to divine the essences of things:\n\nactual objects are almost always only very imperfect copies of the\nIdea that manifests itself in them. Therefore the man of genius\nrequires imagination, in order to see in things not what nature has\nactually formed, but what she endeavoured to form, yet did not bring\nabout \u2026 (\u00a736 p. 198).\n\n\nDilman Walter Gotshalk wrote in Art and the Social Order\n(1947) that aesthetic experience involves the amplification of what is\ncurrently presented in experience by \u201csuggestions of the\nobject\u201d brought to mind by the imagination (p.19).\n\nRoger Scruton built a theory of aesthetic experience on this creative,\nexpansive power of the imagination in his book Art and\nImagination (1974). A proper experience of art is an imaginative\none, one which \u201cgoes beyond what is strictly given\u201d\n(p.98). The relevant role of imagination here is to make it possible\nfor you to engage in a voluntary, willed form of aspectual seeing, or\n\u201cseeing as,\u201d which makes it possible for you to see a\ncertain shade of blue as sad, for instance, even though it\ncannot literally be sad. Scruton is quick to emphasize that\nthis kind of imagination is not perfectly free, but rather\nconstrained; it \u201cinvolves thinking of these descriptions [e.g.\nof blue as sad] as appropriate in some way to the primary\nobject,\u201d and is subject to certain constraints of rationality\nand objectivity (pp. 98, 55, 112).\n\nA final role key role for the imagination in aesthetic experience of\nart involves recreating something that was originally in the mind of\nthe artist. This is, quite often, a matter of an emotion that is\nexpressed in the artwork (Tolstoy 1897 [2007]; Croce 1912, 1938;\nCollingwood 1938 [1958]; see Section 1.4 above). But it can also be\nmore than that. In The Imaginary (1940 [2004]) and his later\nessay \u201cWhat is Literature?\u201d (1948 [1967]) the French\nexistentialist Jean-Paul Sartre spoke of the imagination as needed to\nconstitute an object for conscious aesthetic contemplation (cf.\nDufrenne 1953). In the case of literature, \u201cthe imagination of\nthe spectator has not only a regulative function but a constitutive\none. It does not play: it is called upon to recompose the beautiful\nobject beyond the traces left by the artist\u201d (1948, p. 33). John\nDewey (1934 [1980]) also claimed, in his theory of\n\u2018esthetic\u2019 and thus particularly unified experience, that\na spectator of art \u201cmust create his own experience. And\nhis creation must include relations comparable to those which the\noriginal producer underwent. \u2026 there must be an ordering of the\nelements of the whole that is in form, although not in details, the\nsame as the process of organization the creator of the work\nconsciously experienced\u201d (p.314).\n2.4 Emotion\n\nEmotion has been taken to be central to aesthetic experience since\nearly work on aesthetics as such in the eighteenth century. In France,\nthe influential Abb\u00e9 Jean-Baptiste Du Bos (1719 [1748])\nemphasized the importance of occurrent, bodily emotion in our\nappreciation of drama. This emotion is pleasant in comparison to the\nlanguor of everyday life (cf. discussion in Hume, \u201cOf\ntragedy,\u201d 1757 [1987b]). In Germany, Georg Friedrich Meier\n(1999) treated the passions as essential to the pleasure we take in\naesthetic experience, and Mendelssohn (1785 [1979])\u2014after\nDubos\u2014added that part of why this is pleasurable is that we feel\na certain salutary effect on the body in having emotion in aesthetic\nexperience. Although Baumgarten (1735 [1954]) wrote more generally\nabout aesthetics as the science of cognition of objects by sensation,\nhe also specified in the case of poetry in particular that one central\ngoal is \u201cto arouse affects\u201d (\u00a7XXV, p. 24).\n\nWith the rise of Romanticism and then of empathy theory, artists and\nphilosophers were particularly concerned to clarify the ways in which\naesthetic experience involved feeling an emotion alongside that\nexpressed in an artwork (see Section 1.4 above). It is possible to\ntake aesthetic experience to be singularly focused on emotional\nexpression without claiming that the appreciator of an aesthetic\nobject actually needs to feel the emotion that object expresses\n(Langer 1953). Nonetheless, many views of expression did indeed think\nthat an appropriate aesthetic experience involved feeling that\nexpressed emotion (Bosanquet 1915, Collingwood 1938 [1958], Wollheim\n1990). On a view that takes aesthetic experience essentially to\ninvolve appreciating expression of emotion, and which also takes such\nappreciation essentially to involve feeling that emotion,\nfeeling some emotion or other is essential to aesthetic experience.\nBut the emotion in question varies from case to case, depending on\nwhat the aesthetic object expresses.\n\nA distinct influential view has it that there is one consistent\ndistinctive \u201caesthetic emotion\u201d felt in all aesthetic\nexperience of any object whatsoever. A version of this thought G.E.\nMoore\u2019s brief remarks on aesthetic experience in Principia\nEthica (1903 [1993]; cf. Guyer 2014c pp. 112\u20133): \u201cIt\nis not sufficient that a man should merely see the beautiful qualities\nin a picture and know that they are beautiful, in order that we may\ngive his state of mind the highest praise. We require that he should\nalso appreciate the beauty of that which he sees \u2026 he\nshould have an appropriate emotion towards the beautiful qualities\nwhich he cognizes\u201d (\u00a7113). But the idea of a distinctive\naesthetic emotion is perhaps most closely associated with\nMoore\u2019s friend Clive Bell (1914 [2007]), who took the goodness\nof art to be a matter of its ability to rouse us to a \u201cstate of\necstasy\u201d by its \u201csignificant form\u201d (cf. Dean 1996).\nBell explicitly called this \u201cpeculiar emotion provoked by works\nof art\u201d an \u201caesthetic emotion.\u201d\n\nBell presumed so much agreement on this point that he said little\nabout what this emotion is, leading to much criticism (e.g.\nStolnitz 1960, p. 144). Nelson Goodman (1968 [1976]) claimed that this\noversight meant that Bell had little or no available distinction\nbetween non-aesthetic and aesthetic experience: \u201cThe theory of\naesthetic phlogiston explains everything and nothing\u201d (p.247).\nMore recently, Jesse Prinz (2014) has suggested that we understand the\naesthetic emotion in question as a form of wonder (see Carroll 2019\nfor objections).\n\nAfter Bell, Dewey (1934 [1980]) and Collingwood (1938 [1958]) took\nmore moderate positions on the nature of a specific aesthetic emotion.\nBoth thought that aesthetic experiences were colored distinctively by\ntheir own variable emotions, but also that there is a distinctive\naffect in common across all aesthetic experiences. Dewey claimed that\nthis affect was a matter of \u201cqualitative unity\u201d of an\nexperience (1938 [1980], pp. 84\u20135), and Collingwood that it was\n\u201cthe specific feeling of having successfully expressed\nourselves\u201d (1938 [1958], p. 117).\n\nAll the views discussed in this section thus far share the claim that\nsome emotion or other is essential to aesthetic experience. There are\nother views on which emotion is a common concomitant of aesthetic\nexperience, but that it does not make aesthetic experience what it is\n(e.g. Vivas 1937). Goodman (1968 [1976]) insisted that \u201cin\naesthetic experience the emotions function cognitively\n\u2026 Cognitive use involves discriminating and relating them in\norder to gauge and grasp the work and integrate it with the rest of\nour experience and the world\u201d (p.248). According to Goodman,\nsuch cognitively purposed emotions need not be present in aesthetic\nexperience, and they are sometimes present in non-aesthetic experience\ntoo (p.251).\n\nIt is somewhat surprising that two of the most important historical\ntheories of aesthetic experience make the now rare claim that emotion\nis positively incompatible with aesthetic experience. Kant (1789), for\ninstance, claimed that \u201ca pure judgment of\ntaste\u201d\u2014that which you would make in an aesthetic\nexperience of pure beauty\u2014\u201cis independent of charm and\nemotion\u201d (p.68). Schopenhauer (1818 [1958]) thought of emotion\nas wrapped up in motive and will, in its striving or frustration, but\nalso claimed that aesthetic experience offered complete release from\nsuch striving and frustration. As such, aesthetic experience does not\ninvolve emotion as we ordinarily understand it. Nonetheless,\nSchopenhauer did indeed notice the importance of emotional expression\nto certain arts, and he conceded that some of those general\n\u201cIdeas\u201d we can come to understand in the course of\naesthetic experience are ideas of emotions and \u201ctheir essential\nnature, without any accessories, and so also without the motives for\nthem\u201d (\u00a752, p. 260).\n2.5 Disinterest\n\nThe idea that aesthetic experience must be in some way\n\u201cdisinterested\u201d\u2014roughly speaking, unconcerned with\nthe way its object could serve further practical purposes\u2014is\ncentral in discussion of aesthetic experience. It is used to\ndistinguish aesthetic experience from close counterpart experiences of\nthe same object, and is thought to capture something essential about\nthe nature of the aesthetic. But philosophers can mean quite different\nthings by \u201cdisinterested\u201d (for a brief history, see\nStolnitz 1961).\n\nAnthony Ashley Cooper, the Third Earl of Shaftesbury, is often cited\n(e.g. by Guyer 2004) as the originator of the modern idea of\ndisinterest. However, John Haldane (2013) persuasively traces the idea\nright back to Johannes Scotus Erigena, who wrote in his De\ndivisione naturae that \u201cThe sense of sight is abused by\nthose who approach the beauty of visible forms with appetite or\ndesire\u201d (Haldane 2013, p. 30; Erigena, De divisione\nnaturae, IV\u2013V). Some find an ancient ancestor of the idea\nin Aristotle\u2019s ethical writings (see entry on\n\u201cAristotle\u2019s Aesthetics\u201d).\n\nNonetheless, Shaftesbury (1711) did write of disinterest, and\nillustrated the idea by considering two approaches to a coin: one\naesthetic, which delights just in mere contemplation of its form, and\nthe other practical, which considers what it might purchase. Hutcheson\n(1726 [2004]) followed Shaftesbury in claiming that the pleasure we\ntake in the beautiful is \u201cdistinct from that joy which arises\nfrom self-love upon prospect of advantage,\u201d and from any\nprospect of gaining knowledge (in Cahn and Meskin 2007). Hume\n(1739\u201340 [1987]) is a rare exception amongst eighteenth century\nBritish philosophers in allowing \u201cthat a great part of \u2026\nbeauty \u2026 is deriv\u2019d from the idea of convenience and\nutility\u201d (2.1.8.2; cf. Santayana 1896, Zemach 1997).\n\nEarly eighteenth century German philosophy of pleasure in perception\nexplicitly classified it as pleasure taken in the perfection of\nsomething perfectly suited to its function (Wolff 1719 [2003]; see\nSection 1.1. above). Moses Mendelssohn (1785 [1979]) retained the\ncentrality of perfection to aesthetic experience, but he also claimed\nthat\n\nWe contemplate the beauty of nature and of art, without the least\narousal of desire, with gratification and satisfaction. It seems to be\na particular mark of beauty that \u2026 it pleases, even if we do\nnot possess it, and that is remote from the urge to possess it.\n(Lesson VII, p. 70, translated in Guyer 2020, section on Mendelssohn)\n\n\nIn an essay dedicated to Mendelssohn (\u201cAttempt at a Unification\nof all the Fine Arts and Sciences under the Concept of that which\nis complete in itself\u201d 1785 [1993]), the later aesthetician\nKarl Moritz extended this idea of disinterest to argue that experience\nof the beautiful offers you a way of pleasantly forgetting yourself in\n\u201cunselfish gratification\u201d by thinking of the beautiful\nobject \u201cas something that has been brought forth entirely for\nits own sake, so that it could be something complete in itself\u201d\n(trans. Guyer, p. 545).\n\nIt was Kant\u2019s conception in the Critique of Judgment\n(1789) that cemented the place of disinterestedness in aesthetics, and\nshaped the discourse for the centuries to come. When Kant claimed that\npleasure taken in a representation of a beautiful object (as such) is\n\u201cdisinterested,\u201d he meant that this pleasure is\n\u201cindifferent \u2026 to the real existence of the object of\nthis representation\u201d (\u00a71\u20135). In his system, this is\ntantamount to saying that this pleasure is unmediated by any desire\nfor the object (cf. Zangwill 1992). This disinterest\ndistinguishes the pleasure that grounds a judgment of the beautiful\nfrom the pleasure that grounds a judgment of something as merely\n\u201cagreeable.\u201d Under a separate heading (not that of\n\u201cdisinterest\u201d per se), Kant added that pleasure in a\nbeautiful object is not based in any attribution of a specific purpose\nto it. He thus distanced himself from predecessors like Wolff.\n\nOne way of interpreting a lack of concern with the \u201creal\nexistence\u201d of the object of an aesthetic experience is to\nunderstand that experience as focused on appearances instead. Edward\nBullough (1957) espoused a version of this view in 1907 lectures at\nCambridge. The idea had a wave of popularity in the\nmid-20th century (Gotshalk 1947, Urmson 1957, Tomas 1959).\nThe view survives in the influential contemporary work of Martin Seel\n(2005, p. 24): \u201cto perceive something in the process of its\nappearing for the sake of its appearing is the focal point of\naesthetic perception, the point at which every exercise of this\nperception is directed.\u201d\n\nA variation of this approach casts aesthetic experience as that which\nis valued or enjoyed \u201cfor its own sake,\u201d as opposed to\nvaluing or enjoying it as a means to some further end (cf. Gorodeisky\nand Marcus 2018 on \u201cself-containment,\u201d p. 118). Gary\nIseminger (2006) denies that any aesthetic experience can be\nindividuated purely in terms of how it feels, since what really makes\na state of valued experience aesthetic is a matter of its being valued\njust for its own sake, and valuing is not just a matter of having a\ncertain feeling. In revision of his earlier (1996a, 1996b) account of\naesthetic experience, Jerrold Levinson (2016b) agrees with\nIseminger\u2019s view, except he claims that the evaluative component\nof such appreciation must itself be phenomenological (p.39; cf.\nStecker 2005). Both Iseminger and Levinson treat disinterest in this\nsense as part of what makes aesthetic experience (or appreciation)\naesthetic at all (for objections, see Goodman 1968 [1976] p. 242,\nMeskin 2001, and Carroll 2006).\n\nSome of these views that take aesthetic experience to be valued\n\u201cfor its own sake\u201d depart significantly from the Kantian\nconception of disinterest. For instance, Roger Scruton\u2019s (1974)\nconception of the imaginatively inflected perception (e.g.\n\u201cseeing-as\u201d) essential to aesthetic experience can be\nbased on a desire for an object \u201cfor no other reason,\nwhere one\u2019s desire is, nonetheless, based on a conception of the\nthing one wants\u201d (p.147).\n\nAnother dominant conception of disinterest in the 20th\ncentury was a conception of a certain \u201caesthetic attitude\u201d\none can take voluntary with respect to a natural scene or an\nartwork\u2014an attitude which consists in detaching one\u2019s\npractical self from what is perceived in that object. As Zangwill\n(1992) notes, this notion of disinterest is \u201cunKantian\u201d in\nits modification of a stance, attitude, or type of attention,\nrather than pleasure, as disinterested.\n\nIn discussion of sublime natural phenomena, Edward Bullough (1912)\nseems to have been the first to suggest that we can voluntarily put\nour experience \u201cout of gear with our practical, actual\nself\u201d as long as we have a certain amount of\n\u201cdistance\u201d from the threatening aspects of these natural\nphenomena (in Cahn and Meskin, 2007, pp. 244). What is important in\nthe form of an object of such aesthetic attention is that it supports\na \u201cmarked degree of artificiality\u201d that allows us to take\nthis stance on the object (p.249). This artificiality keeps us engaged\nin a \u201cpersonal\u201d but \u201cfiltered\u201d way with the\nemotions of the object of our experience (p.245).\n\nThe idea that a certain \u201cdistance\u201d can make it possible to\nforget the particularities of one\u2019s own practical situation and\nthereby allow fuller \u201cparticipation\u201d in an object of\naesthetic experience has been attractive to theorists in various\ndistinct research paradigms. Hans-Georg Gadamer (1960 [2005])\nemphasized how \u201caesthetic distance in a true sense \u2026\nmakes possible a genuine and comprehensive participation in what is\npresented before us\u201d via \u201cself-forgetfulness\u201d (pp.\n124\u20135). John Dewey (1934 [2007]) wrote that in\n\u2018esthetic\u2019 experience\n\nThere is no severance of self, no holding of it aloof, but fulness of\nparticipation \u2026 so thoroughgoing \u2026 that the work of art\nis detached or cut off from the kind of specialized desire that\noperates when we are moved to consume or appropriate a thing\nphysically. (p.262; cf. Beardsley 1958 [1981], pp. 288\u2013291)\n\n\nThis conception of disinterest takes it to be not just compatible with\nbut also supportive of a specialized activity\n(\u201cparticipation\u201d), and even sometimes takes it to be a\nproduct of a personal decision to engage in a certain kind of way with\nan object of experience.\n\nIn the middle of the 20th century, George Dickie levied a\nfamous objection to this interpretation of disinterest in his paper\n\u201cThe Myth of the Aesthetic Attitude\u201d (1964). He wrote:\n\n\u201cdisinterestedness\u201d cannot properly be used to refer to a\nspecial kind of attention \u2026 [it] is a term which is used to\nmake clear that an action has certain kinds of motives \u2026\nAttending to an object, of course, has its motives but the attending\nitself is not interested or disinterested \u2026 although the\nattending may be more or less close. (p.60)\n\n\nProposed cases of wrongly motivated attention, he suggests, are really\njust cases of (degrees of) inattention. Levinson (2016b) disagrees,\narguing that attending is indeed something that you can do with a\nmotive, and that the motive you have in attending affects your\nphenomenology. Nanay (2015) picks up this general point and proposes\nthat specifically aesthetic attention is distributed among\nall the properties of an object (though see Nanay 2016 for\ncomplexities).\n\nLanger\u2019s (1953/2007) distinct objection is that the\n\u201caesthetic attitude\u201d is too demanding to be an essential\npart of any aesthetic experience whatsoever: \u201cIf the groundwork\nof all genuine art experience is really such a sophisticated, rare,\nand artificial attitude, it is something of a miracle that the world\nrecognizes works of art as public treasures at all\u201d (p.324).\n\nThese are objections to the interpretation of disinterest in terms of\na special attitude or attentive stance one can take on an object. They\nare not, as such, objections more generally to the claim that\ndisinterest is an essential or even just a necessary aspect of\naesthetic experience. That latter claim is still widely popular. But\nthere are a few reasonable ways to resist it.\n\nOne concerns the deep personal importance of aesthetic experience.\nNick Riggle (2016) argues that our phenomenal appreciation of beauty\nmust be interested in at least a certain sense in order for it to be\nable to effect the types of personal transformation that it does (cf.\nProust 1913\u20131927 [2003], Nehamas 2007). Another way to resist\nthe emphasis on disinterest is to note the great variety of aesthetic\nexperiences available to us, especially with the staggering diversity\nof contemporary arts (Adorno 1970 [1997], pp. 10\u201311).\n2.6 Normativity\n\nAt least since Kant\u2019s Critique of Judgment (1789) many\nhave thought that aesthetic experience involves a form of\nnormativity\u2014either that an aesthetic experience is the type one\nshould have of certain natural scenes or art objects, or that\nhaving some such experience entails thinking that others\nshould have the same experience of that object. Kant\ncertainly made the latter claim. As he put it, an object seems to you\nto merit a certain subjective response of disinterested\npleasure insofar as it sets your faculties of imagination and\nunderstanding into a form of free play (see Section 1.3 and Section\n2.3 above).\n\nBoth Kant and Hume before him (1757 [1987]) took it that aesthetics\ndemanded a reconciliation between two intuitively clashing facts:\nfirst, that the way to appreciate an object aesthetically is to\nfeel some way towards it; and second, that such appreciation\nis merited or deserved. Neither Hume nor Kant thought that beauty was\nan objective matter, even though we do speak of beauty as though it is\na property that inheres in objects (contrast Edith Landmann-Kalischer;\nsee Matherne 2020).\n\nEven though normativity is sometimes tied to objectivity\u2014you\nshould feel or think this about that, because it is an\nobjective matter\u2014this is not so obviously the case in philosophy\nof aesthetic experience. Objectivity and normativity have a tortured\nrelationship in this discussion.\n\nConsider, for instance, George Santayana\u2019s (1896) take. He\npresented beauty as \u201cpleasure regarded as the quality of a\nthing,\u201d i.e. \u201cobjectified\u201d (pp. 31\u20132). To have\nan aesthetic experience is to feel a form of pleasure not as\nbelonging to one\u2019s mind or body, but rather as if it\nbelonged to the object. This need not involve really thinking that the\npleasure really does belong to the object; on the contrary, he\nclaimed, \u201cbeauty \u2026 cannot be conceived as an independent\nexistence which affects our senses and we consequently perceive\u201d\n(p.29). For this reason, phenomenological objectification does not\nmake sense of demands that others feel as you do. On his view, such\ndemands are \u201cunmeaning\u201d (p.27). Nelson Goodman (1968\n[1976]) later called this \u201cmumbo-jumbo\u201d\u2014\u201cwhat\ncan this mean?\u201d (p.243). The only way we could make sense of the\nclaim that we feel as though pleasure really belongs to objects\nthemselves is as a claim that objects express pleasure, but\nnot all aesthetic objects do this.\n\nIn a certain respect, Santayana\u2019s claims of phenomenological\nobjectification are less mysterious than claims of actual\nobjectification of subjective feeling in other aesthetic systems. The\nearly empathy theorist Robert Vischer (1873 [1994]) claimed that the\nartist \u201ctranslate[s] the indefinability and instability of\nmental life, as well as the chaotic disorder of nature, into a\nmagnificent objectivity, into a clear reflection of a free\nhumanity,\u201d and thus generates an item whose investment with\nemotion has a form of universal validity (pp. 116\u201317, emphasis\nadded). Around this time, many of those who take aesthetic experience\nto focus on emotional expression spoke of emotion\n\u201cobjectified\u201d in objects, in a way that was then\ninseparable from the embodiment of that emotion in the physical form\n(Bosanquet 1892 [1904], p. 34; Ducasse 1929, p. 111; Dewey 1934\n[1980], p. 248; Cassirer 1944, pp. 142\u20134). Insofar as feeling\ncan literally be manifested in these physical forms, it is simply a\nmatter of appreciating qualities an object really has that you should\nappreciate such expression and feel certain emotions in their presence\n(see Section 1.4.4).\n\nNewer descendants of this view treat normativity in aesthetic\nexperience as derived from the correctness of seeing-as (or\notherwise perceiving-as). When Kendall Walton (1970) noted that the\nassignment of a category to an artwork affects the expressive\nproperties you experience it as having, he was careful to note that\nonly some category assignments are correct (p.356ff.). Roger Scruton\n(1974) went out on a limb to claim that even though seeing-as (and\nother perceiving-as) is a matter of imagination (see Section 2.3),\nthere are nonetheless right and wrong ways to apply your imagination\nto an object of your attention. Such choices in imagination\n\u201cinvolve a sense of their own \u2018correctness\u2019 or\nappropriateness to an object\u201d (pp. 138\u20139).\n\nKant (1789 [1987]), Vischer (1873 [1994]), and others took aesthetic\nnormativity to be universal: it\u2019s true that everyone\nought to feel a certain way about an object, given that the features\nthat ground that feeling are themselves universal among people.\nOthers\u2014including Scruton and the empathy theorist Herbert\nLangfeld (1920)\u2014are less sanguine about the prospect of\nuniversal agreement; they variously relativize the normative demands\nthat objects make upon us to feel certain ways (Kennick 1958, Goldman\n1995, Levinson 2006a, Matthen 2018). A few personalize the specific\ndemands that artworks or natural scenes can make on our emotions and\nfeelings as individuals (Moran 2004; Nehamas 2007; Riggle 2016; cf.\nNietzsche 1882 [1974] \u00a7290\u2013299 and Landy 2004 on Proust\n1913\u20131927 [2003]).\n\nA demand for someone to have a certain subjective experience of an\nobject only makes sense if they already can have such an experience,\nor at least could cultivate their capacity to have such an experience.\nThis capacity has long been called \u201ctaste\u201d (cf. Korsmeyer\n2013). The resonance with a form of sensation is no accident. Various\neighteenth-century British philosophers (notably Hutcheson 1726\n[2004], Hume 1739\u201340 [1987], and Reid 1785 [1969]) made sense of\nthis capacity as a form of \u201cinternal sense,\u201d whose inputs\nwere reliant upon the representations provided by sensation. Lively\ncontemporary discussion amongst French social elites considered the\nextent to which taste was innate or acquired (Bouhours 1671 [1705], Du\nBos 1719 [1748], Marquise de Lambert 1748 [1770]; see also\nMontesquieu, Voltaire, and d\u2019Alembert\u2019s 1757 and\nDiderot\u2019s 1751 entries into the Encyclop\u00e9die,\nDiderot and d\u2019Alembert, 1751\u20131765).\n\nMany contrasted this quasi-sensory faculty with that of reason\n(Bouhours 1671 [1705], Du Bos 1719 [1748], Marquise de Lambert 1748\n[1770], Montesquieu, Voltaire, and d\u2019Alembert 1757), although\nothers claimed in a post-Cartesian rationalist vein that an\nobject\u2019s beauty was primarily judged through the faculty of\nreason (de Crousaz 1714 [2000]; Andr\u00e9 1741), and even claimed\nthat it was possible to codify contributors to beauty in general\nprinciples (De Lambert, Voltaire, Diderot 1751). Kant (1789) notably\ndenied that any such general principles of taste could possibly be\nformulated or used to reason to the conclusion that something is\nbeautiful.\n\nIn the 20th century, the debate over principles of taste\nsaw a resurgence. Those who deny the existence of any general\nprinciples of taste are \u201cparticularists,\u201d and those who\naccept them \u201cgeneralists.\u201d Notable 20th-century\nparticularists include Croce 1938 [2007], Collingwood 1938 [1958],\nGallie 1956, Isenberg 1949, Sibley 1974, 1983, Mothersill 1988, and\nGoldman 2006 (cf. Kant 1789 [1987] \u00a734\u201335). Notable\ngeneralists include Beardsley (1958 [1981], 1970 [1982]) and Dickie\n2006. While generalists like Beardsley think that we can dispute\nmatters of taste in reasoned argument particularists generally work to\nmake sense of more subtle forms of interpersonal communication about\nexperience (see Isenberg 1949, Hopkins 2004, Mothersill 1988, Sibley\n2001, Cavell 1965 [2007], Wollheim 1968 [1980]).\n\nThere is a new efflorescence of philosophical research into aesthetic\nnormativity, much of which profits significantly from cross-comparison\nof various normative domains (Eaton 2001; Cross 2017, forthcoming;\nHanson 2018, Lopes 2018, 2021, Gorodeisky and Marcus 2018; Gorodeisky\n2019, 2021, Kubala 2021, Dyck 2021, Whiting 2021, forthcoming, Riggle,\nforthcoming; see King 2022 for an overview).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adorno, Theodor, 1970 [1997], <em>Aesthetic Theory</em>, Gretel\nAdorno and Rolf Tiedemann (eds.), Robert Hullot-Kentor (trans.),\nMinneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.", "Addison, J. and R.
