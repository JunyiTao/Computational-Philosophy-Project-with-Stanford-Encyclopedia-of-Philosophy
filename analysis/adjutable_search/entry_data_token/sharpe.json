Life and Works\n\nJohannes Sharpe (Scharp, Scharpe) was from the diocese of M\u00fcnster\nin Westphalia, where he was born presumably around 1360. He received\nhis Bachelor of Arts from the University of Prague in 1379, but spent\nthe greatest part of his academic life in Oxford, where he was fellow\nat Queen\u2019s College from 1391 to 1403, and where he became a\nMaster of Arts and a Doctor of Theology. In 1415 he was lector\nordinarius in L\u00fcneburg (Saxony) (see Conti 1990, p. xvii).\nThe date of his death is unknown.\n\nHe established a reputation as a philosopher and a theologian. The\nnumber of extant manuscripts of his works and their widespread\ndistribution attest to his importance and notoriety throughout the\n15th century. The following writings are attributed to\nhim:\n\na treatise on universals (Quaestio super universalia\n[QsU] \u2013 his only edited work);\na commentary by questions on Aristotle\u2019s On the\nSoul (Quaestio super libros De anima [In De\nanima] \u2013 8 mss.; all references are to the ms. Oxford, New\nCollege 238);\na commentary by questions on Aristotle\u2019s On Physics\n(Quaestio super libros Physicorum \u2013 7 mss.);\na treatise on the properties of being (De passionibus\nentis \u2013 3 mss.);\na treatise on formalities (De formalitatibus \u2013 one\nms. only);\nan abbreviation of Duns Scotus\u2019 Quodlibeta (6\nmss.);\na group of six short treatises on theological subjects (one ms.\nonly).\n\n2. The Oxford Realists\n\nRealism and nominalism were the two major theoretical alternatives in\nthe later Middle Ages concerning the reality and kinds of general\nobjects, and the status and mutual relationships of the basic items of\nthe world (individual and universal substances, individual and\nuniversal accidents) as well as their connection to language. Realists\nbelieved in the extra-mental existence of common natures (or\nessences); nominalists did not. Realists held that Aristotle\u2019s\ntable of categories was first of all a partition of things grounded on\nontological criteria and only secondarily a classification of (mental,\nwritten, and spoken) terms, and therefore that the world is divided\ninto ten kinds of things (in a broad sense of \u2018thing\u2019),\nnot one of which can be reduced to any other. Nominalists maintained\nthat the division into ten categories was a partition of terms on the\nbasis of semantic criteria, and that there are only two or three real\ncategories (substance and quality, and perhaps quantity too). Realists\nbelieved that thought was linguistically constrained by its own\nnature, and accordingly they considered thought to be related to\nreality in its elements and constitution, and deemed language,\nthought, and external reality to be of the same logical coherence.\nNominalists sharply distinguished between things as they exist in the\nexternal world and the various forms by means of which we think-of and\ntalk-about them, since for them our (mental, spoken, and written)\nlanguage does not reproduce the world, but merely regards it, as our\n(mental, spoken, and written) language and the world are logically\nindependent systems.\n\nIn the third decade of the fourteenth century, Ockham argued that the\ncommon realist account of the relationship between universals and\nindividuals was inconsistent with the standard definition of real\nidentity, according to which two items a and b are identical if and\nonly if for all x, x is predicated of a if\nand only x is predicated of b. If universals are\nsomething existing in the world, really identical with their\nindividuals considered as instances of a given type (e.g., the\nuniversal man qua man is identical with Socrates), but\ndifferent considered as properly universals and individuals (e.g., man\nqua universal is different from Socrates considered qua\nindividual), then whatever is predicated of the individuals must be\npredicated of their universals too, and so a unique general object\n(say, the human nature) would possess contrary attributes\nsimultaneously via the attributes of different individuals.\nFurthermore, a same thing would be in different places at the same\ntime, since, for example, the universal-man (homo universalis)\nwould be present at the same time in this man here (in Rome) and in\nthat man there (in Oxford) (cf. Ockham, Expositio in librum\nPraedicamentorum Aristotelis, cap. 8.1, in Opera\nphilosophica, vol. 2, p. 166; and Summa logicae, p. I,\ncap. 15, in Opera philosophica, vol. 1, p. 51).\n\nLater medieval Realists were persuaded that Ockham\u2019s criticism\nwas sufficient to show that the traditional realist account of the\nrelation between universals and particulars was unacceptable, but not\nthat realism as a whole was untenable. Thus, they tried to remove the\nunclear and aporetic points stressed by Ockham by two fundamental\nstrategies: (1) the real distinction between universals and\nindividuals; (2) new notions of identity and distinction. The first\nstrategy is that of Walter Burley, who in his later years (after 1324)\nmany times claimed that universals fully exist outside the mind and\nare really distinct from the individuals in which they are present and\nof which they are predicated, so moving toward a sort of Platonism.\nThe second strategy was that most commonly developed in the later\nMiddle Ages all over the Europe. There were two main lines of this\nstrategy. The first was that of some Italian Dominican masters, such\nas Francis of Prato and Stephen of Rieti in the 1340s, who worked out\nnew definitions for identity and distinction that were inspired by\nHervaeus Natalis\u2019s notion of conformity (see Amerini 2005). The\nsecond approach was that of the most important school of later\nmedieval realists: the so-called \u201cOxford Realists,\u201d\nstarted by John Wyclif. Besides Wyclif himself, this school includes\nthe Englishmen Robert Alyngton, William Milverley, William Penbygull,\nRoger Whelpdale, and John Tarteys, as Johannes Sharpe (or Scharpe) and\nPaul of Venice. According to the Oxford Realists, universals and\nindividuals are really identical but formally distinct. In addition,\nthey claimed that (1) the two notions of formal difference and real\nidentity are logically compatible; (2) predication is a real relation\nbetween things; and (3) the ten Aristotelian categories are ten really\ndistinct kinds of things (res in the strict sense of the term).\n3. The Quaestio super universalia: structure of the work\n\nSharpe\u2019s Quaestio super universalia aspires to be a\nveritable summa of the discussion on universals and related\ntopics that developed during the 14th century. This explains its size\nand the particular arrangement of its subject matter. The work can be\ndivided into five main parts.\nThe first part (pp. 3\u201324) lists\ntwenty-one arguments in support of the nominalist thesis that the\nexistence of universals in re should not be postulated. These\narguments are disparate and not systematically arranged. Thirteen of\nthem can also be found in treatises on universals by other\nfourteenth-century realist authors, specifically in the treatises by\nBurley, Penbygull and Whelpdale. Eight, however, do not seem to be\nfound in other authors, and therefore they can be considered original.\nIn the second part (pp. 24\u201349) twenty arguments in favour of the\nrealist thesis are presented. From the very beginning of this section\nSharpe declares his adherence to the realist thesis with regard to\nuniversals. Five of the arguments in this section seem to come from\nthe prologue of Walter Burley\u2019s commentary on Physics,\nwhere universals are discussed (cf. Burley, Expositio in libros\nocto Physicorum Aristotelis, prologus, Venice 1501,\nfols. 8vb\u20139ra) and one from Burley\u2019s treatise on universals.\nSharpe, however, freely reworks this material and often enriches it\nwith long deductive chains, with which he attempts to prove the two\npremises of the main syllogism and/or show the correctness of the\nconsequentia. Two other arguments seem to be inspired by similar\narguments of Scotus (Ordinatio, I, d. 2, p. 2, qq. 1\u20134 n.\n398: ed. Vat., II, pp. 354 ff.), taken up and refuted by Ockham in his\nSumma logicae (p. I, c. 17: O.Ph., I, pp. 57 and\n59). In the remaining twelve arguments, however, Sharpe probably uses\nmore recent material, as the points of contact with Penbygull\u2019s\nDe universalibus and Alyngton\u2019s commentary on the\nCategories show.\nThe third part (pp. 49\u201368) serves as an\nintroduction to the detailed and reasoned solution of the problem that\nSharpe proposes in the following section. With the exception of the\nopening pages (49\u201350), which are devoted to the identification of the\nentities designated by the term \u2018universal\u2019 (see \u00a7 5\nbelow), this part consists of an examination of eight opinions on the\nproblem of universals. Most of them are anonymous. Sharpe does not\nappear to be interested in criticising this or that particular author,\nbut rather in giving an overview of the most important doctrines that\nhave developed on universals since the middle of the 13th century, and\nthus providing a background against which to situate and characterise\nhis own position. A further confirmation of this attitude is given by\nthe order in which the eight opinions are presented, which\nis not a chronological but a systematic order. The first opinion (pp.\n50\u201351) \u2013 anonymous \u2013 is that of Buridan (or of his school). According\nto Sharpe, this opinion adopts the thesis of the denial of the\nexistence of universals in rerum natura and that of the rejection of simple supposition, even in the anomalous formulation given by\nOckham. The second opinion (p. 52), also anonymous, but qualified as\nvery famous, is Ockham\u2019s: universals are signs of things that\nare naturally produced in our intellect and referring to several\nindividuals at once. The third opinion (p. 55), according to which\nuniversals only have esse obiectivum in the soul, is that of\nAureol, as Sharpe himself declares. The fourth (p. 58) is that of the\nmoderate realism of the 13th century. According to this view, universal\nforms exist outside the soul, but only in potency in individuals, and\nbecome actually universal by the intervention of our intellect, by means\nof the process of abstraction. Sharpe attributes its authorship to\nAverroes and lists Albert the Great and Giles of Rome as its most\nfamous proponents. The fifth opinion (p. 60) is that of Plato, in the\ntraditional formulation given in the Middle Ages: universals exist in things or ex\nparte rei, and are incorruptible forms completely separate from and\nindependent of their singulars. The sixth (p. 62), anonymous, could\nbe the opinion of Scotus or a Scotist. If it is indeed Scotus, it\nshould be noted that Sharpe does not characterise his position in its\ngenerality, but only captures some particular aspects. He reports\nthat, according to the proponents of this view, universals exist\nex parte rei and are those forms, signified by the abstract\nterms of language (such as \u2018humanity\u2019), that constitute\nthe very essences of singulars. The seventh opinion (p. 63),\nanonymous, is Burley\u2019s: universals are the essential forms\npresent in the singulars, from which, however, they are really\ndistinct. The eighth opinion (pp. 65\u201366), also anonymous, is that of\nWyclif, for whom universals (1) exist extra animam and in act\nin individuals, with whom they are really (realiter)\nidentical and formally (formaliter vel secundum rationem)\ndistinct, and (2) can be signified by concrete terms, such as\n\u2018homo\u2019 (\u2018human being\u2019), by abstract\nones, such as \u2018humanitas\u2019\n(\u2018humanity\u2019), by compound expressions, such as\n\u2018homo communis\u2019 (\u2018universal-man\u2019) or\n\u2018species humana\u2019 (\u2018human species\u2019),\nand by infinitive expressions such as \u2018hominem\nesse\u2019 (\u2018being a man\u2019).\nIn the fourth part of\nthe work (pp. 68\u201384), Sharpe sets out in detail his theory of\nuniversals. He begins by stating that he admits the existence of\nuniversals both in meant and extra mentem. The following are mental\nuniversals: first and second intentions, and the acts of cognition\n(intellectiones) themselves. Extramental universals are the\nwritten and spoken terms and the universal forms existing in things. After\ndiscussing this assertion and presenting some possible objections\nwith answers to them, Sharpe puts forward three conclusions, which he\ndiscusses in the same way as the previous general thesis. The three\nconclusions are: (1) the transcendentals (i.e.\nens, aliquid, res, etc.) are common to each\nexistent, but are not properly universals (pp. 74\u201380); (2) the\nuniversal forms are of five different kinds: genera, species,\ndifferences, propria and accidents, according to the\ndifferent ways in which the singular substances participate in them\n(pp. 81\u201382); (3) there are no real universals that correspond to\naccidental concrete terms, such as \u2018album\u2019\n(\u2018white\u2019), \u2018dulce\u2019\n(\u2018sweet\u2019), etc. (pp. 83\u201384).\nIn the fifth, final, and most\nextensive part (pp. 85\u2013145), Sharpe offers a point-by-point rebuttal of the twenty-one\narguments initially presented in support of the nominalist thesis and\nintroduces several other interesting features of his theory of\nuniversals and meaning, on which we shall focus in the following\nparagraphs.\nThe Quaestio super universalia is, therefore, a\nwell-structured and original work in its basic approach and in many of\nthe theses it supports, since Sharpe, unlike other realist authors\nof the second half of the 14th century, tackles the problem of\nuniversals from a purely semantic point of view. This attitude leads\nhim to place the question of universals in the wider context of the\nproblem of meaning and to treat it in relation to the latter. Hence,\nhe frequently rejects as worthless certain solutions typical of the\nrealism of the period. In other ways, however, the Quaestio\nis also a \u2018school\u2019 product, as it represents one of the\nmost interesting results of the process of revision of the principles\nand theses of realism by their most open-minded and intelligent\nsupporters \u2013 a process of revision begun in the early years of\nthe 14th century due to Ockham\u2019s devastating criticisms of\ntraditional realist strategies. There are also evident similarities\nbetween Sharpe\u2019s doctrine and those of Alyngton, Whelpdale,\nPenbygull, Milverley, and Tarteys, with whom he shares a certain\ndependence on Wyclif, whose theory of universals and predication\nappears to be the main point of reference for the metaphysics of these\nthinkers. However, for Sharpe, unlike other Oxonian thinkers who were his\ncontemporaries, Wyclif\u2019s Tractatus de\nuniversalibus and, in general, his writings on logic and\nmetaphysics, are a point of reference in theory only \u2013 this despite the fact that he is clearly familiar with Wyclif, discussing and criticizing his views elsewhere.  Although many of the\narguments he lists quod sic  and quod non are to be\nfound in other 14th and early 15th century authors (though in linguistically quite different forms), we have no positive evidence\nthat Sharpe had their works in front of him when he wrote his\nQuaestio super universalia. It seems rather that he draws on\na whole repertoire of arguments, examples, questions, and opinions on\nuniversals that were in general circulation at Oxford during the\ntime and which appears to have been largely drawn from the works of\nthe most famous English masters of the 14th century: Scotus, Ockham,\nBurley, and Wyclif himself.\n4. The Theory of Meaning\n\nThe basic idea of the standard medieval realist theories of meaning\nwas that semantic classifications derive from ontological differences\namong the signified objects. So, according to this approach, the\nsimple expressions of our language (i.e., names) are distinct from the\ncomplex expressions (i.e., sentences) by virtue of their own\nsignificata, that is by virtue of the different kinds of\nobjects they make known. In fact, the objects signified by complex\nexpressions are compounds of (at least) two of the objects signified\nby simple expressions and a relation of identity (or non-identity, in\nthe case of a true negative sentence), while a simple object is an\nitem in a category (i.e., either a singular substance, or a\nsubstantial form, or an accidental form). Furthermore, every simple\nexpression of our language is like a label naming just one\nobject in the world, but whereas proper names and singular expressions\nlabel individuals (i.e., token-objects), general terms label common\nnatures (i.e., type-objects), which are the main metaphysical\nconstituents of the set of individuals instantiating them. For\ninstance, the general expression \u2018man\u2019 labels and can\nstand for each and every man only because of its primarily signifying\nthe universal form of humanity qua being present in each and\nevery man as the main constitutive principle of his essence.\n\nSharpe rejects the standard realist criteria for the generality (or\nuniversality, according to his terminology) of terms, and\nsubstantially accepts the sense of nominalist criticisms. In his\nopinion, to be matched by a common nature really existing in the world\nis no longer the necessary and sufficient condition for being a\ngeneral term. Rather, signifying universally (that is, signifying a\nunitary concept that in turn refers to a multiplicity of things\ndisplaying at least a similar mode of being [QsU, pp.\n129\u201330]) is a condition for semantic universality of equal\nimportance. He thinks that those terms which signify universally have\nto be viewed as common, as well as those signifying a common nature\nexisting outside the intellect (ibid., p. 69). Thus,\naccording to Sharpe, there are six different kinds of general\nexpressions, both spoken and written:\n\nthose that universally signify a common nature really existing in\nthe world (in re), like the term \u2018humanity\u2019;\nthose that universally connote a common nature really existing in\nthe world, without directly signifying it, like the term\n\u2018white\u2019 (\u2018album\u2019), which refers to\nwhite things and connotes the form of whiteness;\nthose that do not refer to anything really existing in the world,\nbut are somehow correlated with a universal concept, like the terms\n\u2018void\u2019 and \u2018chimaera\u2019;\nthose to which no common nature really existing in the world\ncorresponds, but rather a common transcategorial negative concept,\nunder which a multiplicity of things can be collected, like the term\n\u2018individual\u2019 (the negative concept involved here is the\nconcept of incommunicabilitas, or\nimpossibility-of-being-common, which characterizes individuals);\nequivocal terms as such, since they are connected with a\nmultiplicity of different notions;\ndemonstrative pronouns, like \u2018this (one)\u2019\n(\u2018hoc\u2019), when used to supposit for (refer to) a\ncommon nature, even though they can signify in a singular manner\n(discrete) only (ibid., pp. 69\u201371).\n\n\nAs is evident, Sharpe\u2019s analysis of the types of universality\nfor linguistic terms is based on two distinct but compatible criteria:\n(i) the existence of a common nature directly or indirectly signified\nby them, and (ii) the universal mode of signifying \u2013 the latter\nbeing more important than the former. Thus, based on the satisfaction\nof these two criteria, Sharpe himself reduces the preceding division\nof the kinds of universality to a threefold partition: (i) terms that\nsignify in a universal mode a common nature existing in re\nand which are thus properly common, such as\n\u2018homo\u2019; (ii) terms that signify in a universal\nmode but do not refer to any common nature in re and which\nare thus common in a less proper way, such as\n\u2018chimaera\u2019 and \u2018persona\u2019;\nfinally, (iii) terms that do not signify in a universal mode and which\nare thus common in an improper way whenever they refer to a common\nnature existing in re , such as \u2018hoc\u2019\nand other demonstrative pronouns (QsU, p. 71).\n\nIn turn, mental concepts are common in four ways only, corresponding\nto the first four ways of universality peculiar to spoken (and\nwritten) terms, since there are no universal concepts that correspond\nto demonstrative pronouns or equivocal terms as such\n(ibidem).\n\nThe fourth kind of general term deserves particular attention, since\nit is connected with Sharpe\u2019s solution to the question of the\nsemantic and ontological status of terms of second intention like\n\u2018individual\u2019 or \u2018singular. This was a highly\ncontroversial question in Oxford at the end of the 14th\ncentury. The most common explanation was that proposed by Robert\nAlyngton, a fellow of Queen\u2019s College in the 1380s. According to\nAlyngton, terms like \u2018individual\u2019 have to be considered\nsingular expressions; more precisely they are\n\u201crange-narrowed\u201d expressions, like \u2018this man\u2019,\nbecause they identify a singular referent as a member of a given set\nof individuals. In fact, a term like \u2018individual\u2019\npresupposes a general concept (that of being), the range of which is\nnarrowed to a unique object among beings by an act of our intellect\n\u2013 to one object that is not common. Sharpe, however, argues that\nAlyngton\u2019s answer goes against linguistic usage as well as an\nestablished fact: if Alyngton were right, then the following argument\n(which everybody will admit) would be formally incorrect:\n\n\n\nman runs \n(homo currit) \n\nand not the universal-man \n(et non homo communis) \n\ntherefore, an individual man runs \n(ergo homo singularis currit) \n\n\n\njust like this one:\n\n\n\nman runs \n(homo currit) \n\nand not the universal-man \n(et non homo communis) \n\ntherefore, Socrates runs \n(ergo Sortes currit), \n\n\n\nsince the syntagm \u2018an individual man\u2019 (\u2018homo\nsingularis\u2019) would be a singular term standing precisely\nfor one individual, e.g., \u2018Socrates\u2019\n(\u2018Sortes\u2019). Furthermore, it is a fact that anyone\ncan understand the sentence \u2018an individual man runs\u2019 even\nwithout knowing the identity of the man who is running \u2013 which\nis required according to Alyngton\u2019s theory. Therefore, Sharpe\nregarded second intentions of this kind as common ones\n(ibid., pp. 132\u201333).\n\nIn this way, Sharpe admits that the nominalist explanation of the\nuniversality of signs holds in the particular context of second\nintentions, implicitly rejecting Alyngton\u2019s reduction of\nepistemology to ontology, since according to Sharpe\u2019s account\nthe former has its own range and rules partially independent of the\nlatter. Furthermore, he restores the semantic rank that intuitively\nwould be assigned to the \u2018individual\u2019-like terms\n(something Alyngton was unable to do). On the other hand, his defence\nof realism on the problem of universals is partially invalidated by\nhis qualified acceptance of the nominalist principle of the autonomy\nof thought in relation to the world. In fact, it is evident that from\na semantic and/or epistemological point of view, he can no longer\njustify the extra-mental reality of universals.\n\nLike Burley, Sharpe\u2019s semantics lists a third kind of expression\nbetween simple and complex expressions: concrete accidental terms\n(like \u2018white\u2019 or \u2018father\u2019), whose\nsignificata are neither simple nor complex objects but\nsomething in between. He affirms that concrete accidental terms do not\nsignify simple objects but aggregates composed of a substance and an\naccidental form. Such aggregates are lacking in numerical unity, and\nhence do not fall into any of the ten categories, because they are not\nproperly beings (entia). For that reason concrete accidental\nterms, although simple expressions from a merely grammatical point of\nview, are not names. The two metaphysical components of such\naggregates (i.e., substance and accidental form) are related to the\nconcrete accidental term as follows: although the concrete accidental\nterm connotes the accidental form, this is not its direct\nsignificatum, so that the concrete accidental term can\nsupposit for the substance only. In other words, the concrete\naccidental terms label substances by means of the accidental forms\nfrom which they draw their names, so that they name substances only\nqua bearers (subiecta) of a form. This fact accounts\nfor the difference between general names in the category of substance\n(like \u2018man\u2019) and concrete accidental terms. General names\nin the category of substance are concrete terms as well, but the form\nthey primarily signify is really identical with the substances they\nlabel. Therefore, in this case, the name itself of the form can be\nused as a name of the substance. This obviously implies a slight\ndifference in meaning between abstract and concrete substantial terms,\nsuch as \u2018humanity\u2019 (\u2018humanitas\u2019) and\n\u2018man\u2019 (\u2018homo\u2019). While\n\u2018humanity\u2019 is not the name of the form considered in its\ntotality, but rather the name only of the essential principle of the\nform, that is, of the intensional content carried by the term\n\u2018man\u2019, this latter term signifies the substantial form\nconsidered as a constitutive element of the reality (esse) of\na certain set of individual substances that instantiate it. As a\nconsequence, according to Sharpe, \u2018man is humanity\u2019\n(\u2018homo est humanitas\u2019) is a well formed and true\nsentence, since both subject and predicate signify the same entity,\nbut \u2018white is whiteness\u2019 (\u2018album est\nalbedo\u2019) is not, since \u2018white\u2019 does not\ndirectly signify the accidental form, but only the substrate in which\nit inheres, as bearer of that form, and therefore \u2018white\u2019\ncannot stand for such a form in any sentence (ibid., pp.\n71\u201373).\n5. Universals and Predication\n\nThe core of Sharpe\u2019s metaphysics lies in his theory of\nuniversals. He is a realist, since he defends the extra-mental\nexistence of universals (ibid., p. 68), but he is open to\nnominalism, as he thinks that there is not a close correspondence\nbetween the elements and structures of language and elements and\nstructures of the world. His approach to the whole matter can be\ndefined as \u201canalytical,\u201d since he seems to believe that\n(i) any ontology has to be built up in relation to the resolution of\nsemantic problems, (ii) any philosophical explanation of reality has\nto be preceded by a semantic explanation of the function of our\nlanguage.\n\nSharpe wrote the most interesting treatise on universals of the late\nMiddle Ages other than those of Wyclif and Paul of Venice, arguing\nabout logic and metaphysics, explaining his positions on being and\nessence, universals, singulars, predication, identity and distinction,\nand truth and falsity. His tract is very similar to that of Paul of\nVenice with regard to many metaphysical theses supported, the\nstructure of the work, the textual material utilized, and the opinions\ndiscussed. In his Quaestio super universalia Sharpe lists\neight opinions on universals (Buridan, Ockham, Auriol, Albert the\nGreat and Giles of Rome, Plato, Duns Scotus, Burley, and Wyclif) and\nso does Paul of Venice in his Quaestio de universalibus\n(Ockham, Thomas Aquinas and Giles of Rome, Auriol, Burley, Wyclif,\nPlato, and two other unidentified realist authors). Yet, there are\nsome noteworthy doctrinal differences between them and the other\nOxford realists, which testify to Sharpe\u2019s (and Paul of\nVenice\u2019s) independence of thought.\n\nThe starting point of Sharpe\u2019s theory of universals and\npredication (as well as identity and distinction) is the theory worked\nout by Wyclif and some of his Oxford successors, such as Alyngton and\nPenbygull. Like Duns Scotus and Walter Burley, Wyclif held that\nuniversals in re (or formal universals) exist outside our\nminds in actu and not in potentia, as moderate\nrealists thought. On the other hand, unlike Burley, he maintained that\nthey are really identical with their own individuals, thus accepting\nthe very core of the traditional realist account of the relationship\nbetween universals and individuals. According to Wyclif, since (1)\nuniversals and individuals share the same empirical reality, which is\nthat of individuals, but (2) have opposite constituent principles,\nwhen properly considered as universals and individuals, they are\nreally the same but formally distinct. On his view, because of this\nformal distinction, not everything predicable of individuals can be\ndirectly predicated of universals and vice versa, although an\nindirect predication is always possible. As a consequence, Wyclif\ndistinguished three main non-mutually exclusive types of predication\n(which he conceives as a real relation holding between metaphysical\nentities), each more general than the preceding one (or ones). In the\nTractatus de universalibus they are the following: formal\npredication, predication by essence, and habitudinal predication (see\nthe entry on Wyclif, \u00a72.3). Since habitudinal predication does\nnot require any kind of identity between the entity signified by the\nsubject-term and the entity signified by the predicate-term, but\nformal predication and essential predication do, the ontological\npresuppositions of the most general type of predication, implied by\nthe other types, are completely different from those of the other\ntwo.\n\nThe final result of this way of approaching the problem of universals\nwas a system of intensional logic where (1) the copula of (almost) any\nstandard (philosophical) proposition, such as \u2018Socrates is\nwhite\u2019 or \u2018man is an animal\u2019, has to be interpreted\nin terms of degrees of identity between the things signified by the\nsubject-term and the predicate-term; and (2) individuals and\nuniversals, considered qua beings, appear to be a sort of\nhypostatization of intensions, since they are what is signified by\nproper and common nouns respectively.\n\nSharpe shares the metaphysical view and principles of Wyclif\u2019s\nphilosophical system. His position on the problem of universals can be\nsummed up as follows.\n\nWe can count the following entities as universal: (1.1) those\ncauses that have a multiplicity of effects; (1.2) ideas in God; (1.3)\nthe universal quantifier (syncategorema universaliter\ndistributivum); (1.4) universal propositions, both affirmative\nand negative; (1.5) universal forms, or real universals ; and (1.6)\nuniversal signs, both mental and spoken (or written) (QsU.,\npp. 49\u201350).\nReal universals are naturally apt to be present in many things as\ntheir main metaphysical components.\nReal universals exist in actu outside the mind, since\ntheir being is the same as the being of individuals, which is\nactual.\nMental universals are partially caused in our mind by the common\nnatures existing outside.\n\n\nAs the being of real universals coincides with the being of their\ncorresponding individuals, real universals can be said to be\neverlasting because of the continuous succession of their individuals,\nand also really identical with them. But universals and individuals\nare also formally different from each other, as they have distinct\nconstitutive formal principles, and therefore different properties\n(ibid., pp. 91\u201392). The most important among universal\nsigns are mental universals, which are both the acts of intellection\nthrough which our mind grasps the nature of universal forms and the\nconcepts through which it connects general names with the things to\nwhich they refer (ibid., pp. 68\u201369).\n\nThe description of the relationship between universals and individuals\nin terms of real identity and formal distinction entails (i) that not\nall that is predicated of individuals can be directly\n(formaliter) attributed to their universals and vice\nversa, but (ii) that all that is predicated of individuals has to\nbe in some way or another attributed to universals and vice\nversa. Therefore, a redefinition of the standard kinds of\npredication was required.\n\nLike Alyngton, Penbygull, Tarteys, and Whelpdale, Sharpe modifies\nWyclif\u2019s theory. Agreeing with Alyngton, but against the others,\nhe divides real predication into formal predication (praedicatio\nformalis) and predication by essence (praedicatio essentialis\nvel secundum essentiam), removing habitudinal predication, as it\nis not homogeneous with the first two. According to him, predication\nby essence (1) shows a partial identity between the subject-thing and\nthe predicate-thing, which share some metaphysical component parts,\nand (2.1) does not require (or even (2.2) excludes) that the form\nconnoted by the predicate-term is directly present in the essence\nsignified by the subject-term. \u2018(What is) singular is (what is)\nuniversal\u2019 (\u2018singulare est universale\u2019) is\nan instance of predication by essence. Formal predication, on the\ncontrary, requires such a direct presence. \u2018Man is an\nanimal\u2019 and \u2018man is white\u2019 are instances of formal\npredication (ibid., pp. 89\u201391).\n\nAs is evident from his formulations, Sharpe does not explicitly divide\nformal predication into formal essential and formal accidental\npredication, and offers two different readings of the distinction\nbetween formal predication and predication by essence. According to\nthe common view, predication by essence is more general than formal\npredication. As a consequence, in the standard theory of the Oxford\nrealists, formal predication is a sub-type of predication by essence.\nSharpe introduces another interpretation, according to which the two\nkinds of predication at issue are complementary and mutually\nexclusive. This happens when predication by essence excludes the\nform connoted by the predicate-term being directly present in the\nessence signified by the subject-term (ibid., p. 91).\nAlthough, according to the latter reading, formal predication is not a\nkind of predication by essence, this reading nevertheless implies an\ninterpretation of the \u2018is\u2019 of predication in terms of\nidentity and, therefore, a new definition of the pair of antonymous\nnotions of identity and difference (or distinction).\n6. Identity, Distinction, and Individuation\n\nSharpe\u2019s theory of identity and distinction combines in an\noriginal way those of Duns Scotus, Wyclif, and Penbygull.\n\nPenbygull (De universalibus, pp. 189\u201390) had (1)\ndistinguished between the notion of non-identity and that of\ndifference (or distinction); (2) denied that the notion of difference\nimplies that of non-identity; (3) affirmed that the two notions of\ndifference and real identity are logically compatible, thus admitting\nthat (3.1) there are degrees in distinction, and (3.2) that the\ndegrees of distinction between two things can be read as the inverse\nmeasure of their (partial) identity; and (4) suggested the following\ndefinitions for these three notions, that is non-identity, difference\n(or distinction), and (absolute) identity: (4.1) an entity a\nis non-identical with an entity b if and only if there is not\nany form F such that F is present in the same way in\na and b; (4.2) an entity a differs from an\nentity b if and only if there is at least a form F\nsuch that F is directly present in a but not in\nb, or vice versa; (4.3) an entity a is\nabsolutely identical with an entity b if and only if for any\nform F, it is the case that F is present in a\nif and only if it is present in the same way in b (see the\nentry on William Penbygull, \u00a73).\n\nLike Penbygull, Sharpe considers identity and distinction (or\ndifference) as the two possible inverse measures of the coincidence of\nthe metaphysical components of two given entities (QsU., p.\n92). Moreover, he speaks of formal and real (or essential) identity,\nand formal and real (or essential) distinction (or difference), and\nstates that formal identity is stronger than real (or essential)\nidentity, since the former entails the latter, while, on the contrary,\nreal difference is stronger than formal distinction, since the latter\nis entailed by the former (ibid., pp. 91\u201392).\n\nFinally, he admits degrees in formal distinction, as he recognizes two\ndifferent types, the first of which comes very close to that proposed\nby Scotus in his Ordinatio, while the second is drawn from\nWyclif\u2019s Tractatus de universalibus (ch. 4, pp.\n90\u201392). The first type of formal distinction holds among things\nsuch as the intellective faculties of the soul, whereas the second\nholds between such things as the essence of the soul and its\nintellective faculties and a species and its individuals (Quaestio\nsuper libros De anima, q. 2, fol. 236r-v).\n\nThe two different sets of conditions for the formal distinction can be\nformalized as follows:\n\ntwo entities x and y are formally distinct if\nand only if (i) both of them are constitutive elements of the same\nreality, but (ii) neither of them can exist by itself, or (iii) is\npart of the definite description of the other.\ntwo entities x and y are formally distinct if\nand only if (i) there is at least one z such that z\nis predicated of x and not of y, or vice\nversa, but (ii) x and y are really identical,\nas one is directly predicated of the other qua its main\nintrinsic metaphysical component.\n\n\nAccordingly, real identity, which is presupposed by the formal\ndistinction, has to be defined in these terms (QsU, p.\n98):\n\na is really identical with b if and only if both are\nconstitutive elements, or material parts, of the same reality, or one\nof them is directly predicated of the other qua its superior\nin the categorial line (that is, qua its main intrinsic\nmetaphysical component).\n\n\nAs a result, Sharpe\u2019s world consists of finite beings (that is,\n\u201cthings\u201d like men, horses, stones etc.), really existing\noutside the mind, made up of an individual substance and a host of\nformal entities (common substantial natures and accidental forms, both\nuniversal and singular) existing in it and through it, since none of\nthese formal entities can exist by themselves. They are real only\ninsofar as they constitute individual substances or are present in\nindividual substances qua their properties. Specific\nsubstantial natures (or essences) can be conceived from two points of\nview: intensionally (in abstracto) and extensionally (in\nconcreto). Viewed intensionally, specific substantial natures are\nnothing but the set of essential properties that individual substances\nare to instantiate, but considered without any reference to such\ninstantiations. Viewed extensionally, specific substantial natures are\nthose same forms conceived of as instantiated by at least one singular\nsubstance. For instance, human nature considered intensionally is\nhumanity (humanitas), extensionally the universal-man\n(homo in communi). Humanity is properly a form, or more\naccurately, the essential principle of a substantial form, that is,\nsomething existentially incomplete and dependent; the universal-man is\nthis same form considered according to its own mode of being, and\ntherefore as a sort of existentially autonomous and independent entity\n(ibid., p 102). Consequently, like Wyclif, Sharpe holds that\na formal universal actually exists outside the mind if at least one\nindividual instantiates it, so that without individuals, common\nnatures (or essences) are not really universals (ibid., pp.\n105\u201306). This means that the relationship between common natures\nand singulars is ultimately based on individuation, since no actual\nuniversality and no instantiation is possible without individuation.\nOn this subject Sharpe seems to accept the essentials of\nAquinas\u2019 doctrine, since he affirms that (i) the universal-man\nis compounded of both common matter and form and that (ii) matter as\naffected by dimensive quantity and other accidental properties\n(materia quanta et accidentibus substrata) is the very\nprinciple of individuation, since it causes the passage from the level\nof universals to that of singulars (ibid., pp. 137\u201339).\nThus, according to Sharpe, explaining individuation means explaining\nhow a multiplicity of individuals can be obtained from a single\nspecific nature, the problem at issue being the dialectical\ndevelopment from one to many and not the passage from abstract to\nconcrete.\n\nSharpe\u2019s world counts many types of entities: universal and\nindividual substances and accidents (like homo in communi and\nSocrates, and like the general form of whiteness and this particular\nform of whiteness), universal abstract substantial essences (like\nhumanity), universal and individual substantial forms (like the human\nsoul in general and the soul of Socrates), general and individual\ndifferences (like the universal-rationality and the rationality proper\nto Socrates) \u2013 each one characterized by its own mode of being.\nThis world is certainly very complex, but its complexity is exceeded\nby complexity in language. Sharpe denies that there is a close\ncorrespondence between language and the world, as he believes that our\nthought is caused by the world, and our language by our thought, and\nthe relation between causes and effects is a relation of one to\nmany.\n7. Psychology and Theory of Knowledge\n\nThe sources of Sharpe\u2019s psychological and epistemological\ntheories are St. Thomas, Duns Scotus, and Ockham, although the latter\nis chiefly a polemical source, as Kennedy 1969 pointed out (pp. 253\nand 270). Like Aquinas, Sharpe\n\nmaintains that the intellectual soul is the immediate form of the\nhuman body, so that the whole being of the latter totally depends on\nthe former, although souls are individuated by bodies (In De\nanima, fols. 217v-218r), and\nclaims that each man has his own intellect, arguing against\nAverroes\u2019 thesis of the unicity and separate character of the\npassive intellect for the whole human species (ibid., fols.\n210r-212v).\n\n\nLike Duns Scotus, Sharpe thinks there is not a real distinction\nbetween the soul and its intellective faculties (i.e., the active\nintellect, the passive intellect, and the will) or among the\nintellective faculties themselves, but only a formal distinction. On\nthe other hand, the soul\u2019s corporeal powers (potentiae\nincorporatae), which depend on bodily organs for their\noperations, are really distinct from the soul and from each other\n(ibid., fol. 236v).\n\nLike Aquinas and Duns Scotus, and against Ockham, Sharpe affirms that\nintelligible species are required for intellection (ibid.,\nfol. 244r). The main arguments he uses in favor of this thesis are the\nfollowing:\n\nOur mind\u2019s objects of intellection are the universal\nessences or common natures. But they cannot be present themselves to\nthe mind. Therefore, some sign of them, that is, the intelligible\nspecies, has to be directly present in the intellect.\nA universal principle of intellection is necessary in order to\nunderstand a universal object, like a common nature. The phantasm is\nparticular, since it is the mental representation of a singular\nobject. Therefore a universal species, abstracted from the phantasm,\nis required.\nIf there were no species, nothing would be retained by the\nintellect after an act of intellection. Therefore we could not\nunderstand each other, or understand more easily the second time,\nsince there would be no objects for our memory (ibid., fols.\n239v-240v).\n\n\nFinally, like Duns Scotus and Ockham, and against St. Thomas, Sharpe\nstates that our intellect can know perfectly even individual material\nthings (ibid., fol. 253r). What is more, it can know\nimmaterial beings as well, since the most general and proper object of\nour intellect is being in all its amplitude (ibid., fol.\n253v). Sharpe here distinguishes perfect knowledge from complete\nknowledge. For a perfect knowledge of something it is sufficient that\nour intellect is able to single out the object in question against\nothers by means of a proper concept. For a complete knowledge of\nsomething it is necessary that our intellect is able to list all the\nproperties, both substantial and accidental, of the object at issue.\nIt is therefore evident that we can have a perfect knowledge of\nsomething without completely knowing it, as is the case with\nindividual material things and immaterial beings (ibid., fol.\n254r-v).\n8. Natural Philosophy: the Commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Physics\n\nSharpe\u2019s commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Physics (ms.\nOxford, New College 238, fols. 53r-208v) contains nine large\nquestions, one for each book of Aristotle\u2019s work, except for the\nfourth book to which two questions are dedicated, one concerning place\nand one time. Each question is divided into two main parts: in the\nfirst, Sharpe lists a series of arguments against the question itself\n(contra questionem in se), namely, in general, for supporting a\nnegative answer to the main question. In the second part, he expounds\nhis own opinion and refutes the arguments quod non.\n\nThe first question (fols. 53r-88v) is whether, from the point of view\nof the natural philosophy, material things have three constitutive\nprinciples only, that is: matter, form, and privation, or not.\nSharpe\u2019s answer is affirmative, but he points out that the\nconstitutive principles of material things are three by species and\nnot in number. Indeed, material things have more than three principles\nin number, but each of them is reducible to matter, or form, or\nprivation.\n\nThe second question (fols. 89r-128v) is whether there are four kinds\nof causes in the natural world or not. According to Sharpe, the\nefficient, formal, material, and final causes alone are properly\ncauses, while chance and fortune are accidental, and therefore\nimproper (per accidens) causes. \n\nThe third question (fols. 128v-143v) is whether motion (motus),\nwhich is an imperfect act of those beings that are in potentia\nto something, is the same item in essentia as action and\npassion. Before answering, Sharpe remarks that we can consider action\nand passion in two ways: either materially or formally. In the first\ncase, the answer is affirmative, since action and passion share the\nphysical reality of the motion itself. But formally conceived, action\nand passion are different from each other and from the motion, since\nthey are distinct relational properties (respectus) of the\nmotion.\n\nThe fourth question (fols. 144r-160r) is whether the immobile place of\na certain body is the ultimate surface of what that contains that body\nor not. According to Sharpe, it is false that the last surface of the\ncontaining body is absolutely immobile, as only the ninth and tenth\nheavens are such.\n\nThe fifth question (fols. 160v-175r), but second related to the fourth\nbook of Aristotle\u2019s Physics, is whether time is the\nmeasure of change in respect of the before and after. Sharpe\u2019s\nanswer is affirmative, as always, but he specifies that this is not\nproperly the definition of time, but rather the description of its\nnature. In his view, it follows from this description that (1) time\nmeasures mutable things only, but not immutable; and (2) time is\nclosely connected exclusively with that kind of motion which entails a\nbefore and an after.\n\nThe sixth question (fols. 175r-185r) is whether continuity and\ncontrariety of motion (continuitas et contrarietas motuum) are\npresent only in the categories of quantity, quality, and where. Sharpe\nthinks it is so, as only these three categories are properly\ncharacterized by the existence in them of distance. As a matter of\nfact, in these three categories are present sequences of items such\nthat in order to move from one term to the other of the series, it is\nnecessary to pass through intermediate terms.\n\nThe seventh question (fols. 185v-195r) is whether continuous physical\nmagnitudes are compounded by atomic elements not further divisible.\nSharpe\u2019s answer is negative, for continuous magnitudes are\ndivisible ad infinitum by definition.\n\nThe eight question (195v-201r) is whether, in order to compare two\nmotions belonging to the same genus (of motion), it is necessary that\nthe mover and the mobile be simultaneous. Sharpe\u2019s answer is\naffirmative, but he specifies that it is not always possible to\ncompare two motions belonging to the same genus. This is possible only\nwhen the motions that have to be compared belong to the same kind\n(species specialissima).\n\nThe last question (fols 201v-208v) is whether the perpetual motion of\nthe heavens depends on the prime mover or not. Sharpe\u2019s answer\nis affirmative and very short. Almost all of the second part of the\nquestion deals with the problem of the nature and properties of the\nprime mover.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Secondary literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "<em>Quaestio super universalia</em>, A.
