    "main_text": "Applications || Logic and Philosophy\n4.6 Logic and Philosophy\n\nIn the spirit of Wos, Overbeek, Lusk & Boyle 1992, we pose the\nquestion: What do the following statements about different systems of\nformal logic and exact philosophy have in common?\n\nThe implicational fragments of the modal logics S4 and S5 have\nbeen studied extensively over the years. Posed as an open question, it\nwas eventually shown that there is a single axiom for implicational S4\nas well as several new shortest axioms for implicational S5 (Ernst,\nFitelson, Harris & Wos 2002).\nThe L combinator is defined as (Lx)y =\nx(yy). Although it was known that the\nL-based combinator E12 =\n((L(LL))(L(LL)))((L(LL))(L(LL)))\nsatisfies E12E12 =\nE12 the question remained whether a shorter\nL-based combinator satisfying this property existed.\n(Glickfeld & Overbeek 1986) showed this to be the case with\nE8 =\n((LL)(L(LL)))(L(LL)).\nThirteen shortest single axioms of length eleven for classical\nequivalence had been discovered, and XCB =\ne(x, e(e(e(x,\ny), e(z, y)), z)) was the\nonly remaining formula of that length whose status was\nundetermined\u2014was it an axiom? For a quarter of a century this\nquestion remained open despite intense study by various researchers.\nIt was finally settled that XCB is indeed such a single\naxiom, thus ending the search for shortest single axioms for the\nequivalential calculus (Wos, Ulrich & Fitelson 2002).\nSaint Anselm of Canterbury offered in his Proslogium a\nfamous argument for the existence of God. But, quite recently, a\nsimpler proof has been discovered in the sense that it is shorter and\nuses fewer assumptions (Oppenheimer & Zalta 2011). In the same\ntradition, G\u00f6del produced a proof of God\u2019s existence but\n(Benzm\u00fcller & Paleo 2014) have recently proved the same result\nusing a weaker logic system while simultaneously addressing a major\ncriticism of G\u00f6del\u2019s proof.\nIn the axioms defining a Robbins algebra, the Huntington\u2019s\nequation \u2212(\u2212(x + y) + \u2212(x\n+ \u2212y)) = x can be replaced by a simpler one,\nnamely the Robbins equation \u2212(\u2212x + y) +\n\u2212(\u2212x + \u2212y) = x. This\nconjecture went unproved for more than 50 years resisting the attacks\nof many logicians including Tarski until it was eventually proved in\n(McCune 1997).\n\n\nWe ask again, what do these results have in common? The answer is that\neach has been proved with the help of an automated reasoning program.\nHaving disclosed the answer to this question prompts a new one: How\nmuch longer would have taken to settle these open problems without the\napplication of such an automated reasoning tool? \n\nThe strict implicational fragments of the logical systems S4 and S5 of\nmodal logic are known as C4 and C5, respectively, and\ntheir Hilbert-style axiomatizations presuppose condensed detachment as\ntheir sole rule of inference. With insight from Kripke\u2019s work,\nAnderson & Belnap (1962) published the first axiomatization of C4\nusing the following 3-axiom basis, where the Polish notation\n\u2018Cpq\u2019 stands for \u2018p\n\u2192 q\u2019. \n\n\n(1)\nCpp\n\nCCpqCrCpq\n\nCCpCqrCCpqCpr \n\n\nA question was posed sometime after: Is there a shorter such\naxiomatization for C4, using a 2-axiom basis or even a single axiom?\nUsing the automated reasoning program Otter, the authors Ernst,\nFitelson, Harris & Wos (2001) settled both questions in the\naffirmative. In fact, several 2-axiom bases were discovered of which\nthe following turned out to be shortest: \n\n\n(2)\nCpCqq\n\nCCpCqrCCpqCsCpr \n\n\nFurther rounds of automated reasoning work were rewarded with the\ndiscovery of a single axiom for C4; the axiom is 21 symbols long and\nit was also proved that it is the shortest such axiom: \n\n\n(3)\nCCpCCqCrrCpsCCstCuCpt \n\n\nTo show that each of (2) and (3) is necessary and sufficient for (1),\na circle of proofs was produced using the automated reasoning tool:\n(1) \u21d2 (3) \u21d2 (2) \u21d2 (1). As for C5, its axiomatization\nwas originally published in a paper by Lemmon, A. Meredith, D. Meredith,\nPrior & Thomas (1957) giving several 4-, 3-, 2- and 1-axiom bases\nfor C5, including the following 3-axiom basis: \n\n\n(4)\nCqCpp\n\nCCpqCCqrCpr\n\nCCCCpqrCpqCpq \n\n\nThe publication also included the shortest known 2-axiom bases for C5\n(actually two of them, containing 20 symbols each) but the shortest\nsingle axiom for C5 was later discovered by (Meredith and Prior 1964)\nand having 21 symbols: \n\n\n(5)\nCCCCCppqrCstCCtqCsCsq \n\n\nApplying automated reasoning strategies again, Ernst, Fitelson,\nHarris & Wos 2001) discovered several new bases, including the\nfollowing 2-axiom basis of length 18 and six 1-axiom bases matching\nMeredith\u2019s length of 21 (only one of these is given below): \n\n\n(6)\nCpp\n\nCCpqCCCCqrsrCpr \n\n\n\n(7)\nCCCCpqrCCuuqCCqtCsCpt \n\n\nTo show that each of (6) and (7) is necessary and sufficient for (4),\na circle of proofs was also produced with the theorem prover: (6)\n\u21d2 (4) \u21d2 (7) \u21d2 (6). \n\nA charming foray into combinatory logic is presented\nin Smullyan 1985 and Glickfeld & Overbeek 1986, where we learn\nabout a certain enchanted forest inhabited by talking birds. Given any\nbirds A and B, if the name of bird B is\nspoken to bird A then A will respond with the name\nof some bird in the forest, AB, and this response to\nB from A will always be the same. Here are some\ndefinitions about enchanted birds: \n\n\n\nB1\nA mockingbird M mimics any bird in\nthe sense that M\u2019s response to a bird x is the same\nas x\u2019s response to itself, Mx = xx.\n\n\nB2\nA bird C composes birds A and\nB if A(Bx) = Cx, for any bird\nx. In other words, C\u2019s response to x is the\nsame as A\u2019s response to B\u2019s response to\nx. \n\nB3\nA bird A is fond of a bird B if A\u2019s\nresponse to B is B; that is, AB =\nB. \n\n\n\nAnd here are two facts about this enchanted forest: \n\n\n\nF1\nFor any birds A and B in the forest there is a\nbird C that composes them. \n\nF2\nThere is a mockingbird in the forest. \n\n\n\nThere have been rumors that every bird in the forest is fond of at\nleast one bird, and also that there is at least one bird that is not\nfond of any bird. The challenge to the reader now is, of course, to\nsettle these rumors using only F1 and F2, and the given definitions\n(B1)\u2013(B3). Glickfeld & Overbeek 1986 do this in mere\nseconds with an automated reasoning system using paramodulation,\ndemodulation and subsumption. For a more challenging problem, consider\nthe additional definitions: \n\n\n\nB4\nA bird is egocentric if it is fond of itself: EE =\nE. \n\nB5\nA bird L is a lark if for any birds x and\ny the following holds: (Lx)y =\nx(yy). \n\n\n\nSmullyan challenges us to prove a most surprising thing about larks:\nSuppose we are not given any other information except that the forest\ncontains a lark. Then, show that at least one bird in the forest must\nbe egocentric! Below we give the salient steps in the proof found by\nthe automated reasoning system, where \u2018S(x,\ny)\u2019 stands for \u2018xy\u2019 and where\nclauses (2) and (3) are, respectively, the definition of a lark and\nthe denial of the theorem; numbers on the right are applications of\nparamodulation: \n\n\n\n\n1\n(x1 = x1)\n \n\n2\n(S(S(L, x1), x2) = S(x1, S(x2, x2)))\n \n\n3\n-(S(x1, x1) = x1)\n \n\n6\n(S(x1, S(S(L, S(x2, x2)), x2)) = S(S(L,\nx1), S(x2, x2)))\n2\u00a02 \n\n8\n(S(x1, S(S(x2, x2), S(x2, x2))) =\nS(S(L, S(L, x1)), x2))\n2\u00a02 \n\n9\n(S(S(S(L, L), x1), x2) = S(S(x1, x1),\nS(x2, x2)))\n2\u00a02 \n\n18\n-(S(S(L, S(S(L, S(L, L)), x1)), x1) =\nS(S(L, S(x1,x1)), x1))\n6\u00a03\u00a06\u00a09\u00a08\u00a08 \n\n19\n[]\n18\u00a01 \n\n\n\n\nCloser inspection of the left and right hand sides of (18) under the\napplication of unification revealed the discovery of a 10-L\nbird, i.e. a 10-symbol bird expressed solely in terms of larks, which\nwas a strong candidate for egocentricity. This discovery was exciting\nbecause the shortest egocentric L-bird known to Smullyan was\nof length 12. A subsequent run of the automated reasoning system\nproduced a proof of this fact as well as another new significant bird:\nA possible egocentric 8-L bird! A few more runs of the system\neventually produced a 22-line proof (with terms with as many as 50\nsymbols, excluding commas and parentheses) of the fact that\n((LL)(L(LL)))(L(LL)) is\nindeed egocentric. The natural questions to ask next are, of course,\nwhether there are other 8-L egocentric birds and whether\nthere are shorter ones. The reader may want to attempt this with paper\nand pencil but, given that there are 429 such birds, it may be wiser\nto try it instead (or in conjunction) with an automated reasoning\nprogram; both approaches are explored in Glickfeld & Overbeek\n1986. For a more formal, but admittedly less colorful, introduction\nto combinatory logic and lambda-conversion the reader is referred to\nHindley & Seldin 1986. \n\nFormulas in the classical equivalential calculus are\nwritten using sentential variables and a two-place function symbol,\ne, for equivalence. The calculus has two rules of inference,\ndetachment (modus ponens) and substitution; the rules can be combined\ninto the single rule of condensed detachment: Obtain t\u03b8\nfrom e(s,t) and r where\ns\u03b8 = r\u03b8 with mgu \u03b8. The calculus\ncan be axiomatized with the formulas: \n\n\n(E1)\ne(x,x)\n(reflexivity) \n\n(E2)\ne(e(x,y),e(y,x))\n(symmetry) \n\n(E3)\ne(e(x,y),e(e(y,z),e(x,z)))\n(transitivity) \n\n\nWe can dispense with reflexivity since it is derivable from the other\ntwo formulas. This brings the number of axioms down to two and a\nnatural question to ask is whether there is a single axiom for the\nequivalential calculus. In 1933, \u0141ukasiewicz found three formulas\nof length eleven that each could act as a single axiom for the\ncalculus\u2014here\u2019s one of them:\ne(e(x,y),e(e(z,y),e(x,z)))\u2014and\nhe also showed that no shorter single axiom existed. Over time, other\nsingle axioms also of length eleven were found and the list kept\ngrowing with additions by Meredith, Kalman and Peterson to a total of\n14 formulas of which 13 were known to be single axioms and one formula\nwith a yet undetermined status: the formula XCB =\ne(x, e(e(e(x,\ny), e(z, y)), z)).\n(Actually, the list grew to 18 formulas but Wos, Winker, Veroff,\nSmith & Henschen 1983 reduced it to 14.) Resisting the intense\nstudy of various researchers, it remained as an open question for many\nyears whether the 14th formula, XCB, was a single axiom for\nthe equivalential calculus (Peterson 1977). One way to answer the\nquestion in the affirmative would be to show that at least one of the\n13 known single axioms is derivable from XCB alone; another\napproach would be to derive from XCB the 3-axiom set\n(E1)\u2013(E3). While Wos, Ulrich & Fitelson 2002 take shots at\nthe former, their line of attack concentrates on the latter with the\nmost challenging task being the proving of symmetry. Working with the\nassistance of a powerful automated reasoning program, Otter, they\nconducted a concerted, persistent and very aggressive assault on the\nopen question. (Their article sometimes reads like a military briefing\nfrom the front lines!) For simpler problems, proofs can be found by\nthe reasoning program automatically; deeper and more challenging ones\nlike the one at hand require the guidance of the user. The relentless\napplication of the reasoning tool involved much guidance in the\nsetting of lemmas as targets and the deployment of an arsenal of\nstrategies, including the set of support, forward and backward\nsubsumption, lemma adjunction, formula complexity, hints strategy,\nratio strategy, term avoidance, level saturation, and others. After\nmuch effort and CPU time, the open question finally succumbed to the\ncombined effort of man and machine and a 61-step proof of symmetry was\nfound, followed by one for transitivity after 10 more applications of\ncondensed detachment. Subsequent runs of the theorem prover using\ndemodulation blocking and the so-called cramming strategy delivered\nshorter proofs. Here are the last lines of their 25-step proof which\nin this case proves transitivity first followed by symmetry: \n\n\n\n123\n[hyper,51,106,122]\nP(e(e(e(e(x,y),e(z,y)),z),x)).\n\n\n124\n[hyper,51,53,123]\nP(e(e(e(e(e(e(e(x,y),e(z,y)),\n\nz),x),u),e(v,u)),v)). \n\n125\n[hyper,51,124,123]\nP(e(e(e(x,y),x),y)). \n\n127\n[hyper,51,124,108]\nP(e(e(e(e(x,e(e(e(x,y),e(z,y))\n\n,z)),e(e(e(e(e(u,v),e(w,v)),w),u),\n\nv6)),v7),e(v6,v7))). \n\n128\n[hyper,51,127,123]\nP(e(e(x,y),e(e(y,z),e(x,z)))).\n\n\n130\n[hyper,51,128,125]\nP(e(e(x,y),e(e(e(z,x),z),y))).\n\n\n131\n[hyper,51,128,130]\nP(e(e(e(e(e(x,y),x),z),u),\n\ne(e(y,z),u))). \n\n132\n[hyper,51,131,123]\nP(e(e(x,y),e(y,x))). \n\n\n\nWith an effective methodology and a strategy that included the\nassistance of an automated reasoning program in a crucial way, the\nsearch for shortest single axioms for the equivalent calculus came to\nan end. \n\nFitelson & Zalta 2007, Oppenheimer & Zalta 2011, and Alama,\nOppenheimer, & Zalta 2015 describe several applications of\nautomated reasoning in computational metaphysics. By\nrepresenting formal metaphysical claims as axioms and premises in an\nautomated reasoning environment using programs like Prover9, Mace4,\nthe E-prover system and Paradox, the logical status of metaphysical\narguments is investigated. After the suitable formalization of axioms\nand premises, the model finder program Mace4 is used to help verify\ntheir consistency. Then, using Prover9, proofs are automatically\ngenerated for a number of theorems of the Theory of Plato\u2019s Forms,\ntwenty five fundamental theorems of the Theory of Possible Worlds, the\ntheorems described in Leibniz\u2019s unpublished paper of 1690 and in his\nmodal metaphysics, and a fully automated construction of Saint\nAnselm\u2019s Ontological Argument. In the latter application, Saint Anselm\nis understood in Oppenheimer & Zalta 2011 as having found a way of\ninferring God\u2019s existence from His mere being as opposed to inferring\nGod\u2019s actuality from His mere possibility. This allows for a\nformalization that is free of modal operators, involving an underlying\nlogic of descriptions, three non-logical premises, and a definition of\nGod. Here are two key definitions in the formalization, as inputted\ninto Prover9, that helped express the concept of God: \n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of none_greater: \n\nall x (Object(x) -> (Ex1(none_greater,x)\n<-> \n\n\u00a0(Ex1(conceivable,x) & \n\n\u00a0\u00a0-(exists y (Object(y) &\nEx2(greater_than,y,x) & \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ex1(conceivable,y)))))).\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\nDefinition of God: \n\nIs_the(g,none_greater). \n\n\n\n\n\nPart of the challenge when representing in Prover9 these and other\nstatements from axiomatic metaphysics was to circumvent some of the\nprover\u2019s linguistic limitations. For example, Prover9 does not have\ndefinite descriptions so statements of this kind as well as\nsecond-order concepts had to be expressed in terms of Prover9\u2019s\nexisting first-order logic. But the return is worth the investment\nsince Prover9 not only delivered a proof\nof Ex1(e,g)\u2014there is one and only one\nGod\u2014but does so with an added bonus. A close inspection of the\noutput provides yet another example of an automated theorem prover\n\"outreasoning\" its users, revealing that some of the logical machinery\nis actually redundant: The proof can be constructed only using two of\nthe logical theorems of the theory of descriptions (called \"Theorem 2\"\nand \"Theorem 3\" in their article), one of the non-logical premises\n(called \"Premise 2\"), and the definition of God. We cannot help but to\ninclude here Prover9\u2019s shorter proof, written in the more elegant\nnotation of standard logic (from Oppenheimer & Zalta 2011): \n\n\n1.\n~E!\u03b9x\u03c61\nAssumption, for Reductio \n\n2.\n\u2203y(Gy\u03b9x\u03c61\n& Cy)\nfrom (1), by Premise 2 and MP \n\n3.\nGh\u03b9x\u03c61 &\nCh\nfrom (2), by \u2203E, \u2018h\u2019 arbitrary\n\n\n4.\nGh\u03b9x\u03c61\nfrom (3), by &E \n\n5.\n\u2203y(y =\n\u03b9x\u03c61)\nfrom (4), by Theory of Descriptions, Theorem 3 \n\n6.\nC\u03b9x\u03c61 &\n~\u2203y(Gy\u03b9x\u03c61 &\nCy)\nfrom (5), by Theory of Descriptions, Theorem 2 \n\n7.\n~\u2203y(Gy\u03b9x\u03c61\n& Cy)\nfrom (6), by &E \n\n8.\nE!\u03b9x\u03c61\nfrom (1), (2), (7), by Reductio \n\n9.\nE!g\nfrom (8), by the definition of \u2018g\u2019 \n\n\nIn the same tradition as St. Anselm\u2019s, G\u00f6del also provided an\nontological proof of God\u2019s existence (G\u00f6del 1970, Scott 1972). An\nimportant difference between the two is G\u00f6del\u2019s use of modal\noperators to represent metaphysical possibility and necessity and, of\ncourse, his use of symbolic logic for added reasoning precision. In\nhis proof, G\u00f6del begins by framing the concept of \u201cpositive\nproperty\u201d using two axioms, and he introduces a definition\nstating that \u201cA God-like being possesses all positive\nproperties\u201d. This is enough logical machinery to prove as a\ntheorem the possibility of God\u2019s existence,\n\u25ca\u2203xG(x); three more axioms and\ntwo additional definitions allow G\u00f6del to further his proof to\nestablish not only that God exists,\n\u2203xG(x), but that this is so by\nnecessity, \u25a1\u2203xG(x).\nG\u00f6del\u2019s proof is in the formalism of higher-order modal logic\n(HOML) using modal operators and quantification over properties.\nG\u00f6del never published his proof but he shared it with Dana Scott\nwho produced the version presented below, which is taken from\n(Benzm\u00fcller & Paleo 2014) along with its English annotation to\naid the reader with its intended interpretation: \n\n\nAxiom A1\n\n\u2200\u03d5[P(~\u03d5)\u00a0\u2261\u00a0~P(\u03d5)]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Either a property or its negation is positive, but not\nboth)\n\nAxiom A2\n\n\u2200\u03d5\u2200\u03c8[(P(\u03d5)\u00a0\u2227\u00a0\u25a1\u2200x[\u03d5(x)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u03c8(x)])\u00a0\u2283\u00a0P(\u03c8)]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0A property necessarily implied by a positive property\nis positive\n\nTheorem T1\n\n\u2200\u03d5[P(\u03d5)\u00a0\u2283\u00a0\u25ca\u2203x\u03d5(x)]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Positive properties are possibly exemplified\n\nDefinition D1\n\nG(x)\u00a0\u2261\u00a0\u2200\u03d5[P(\u03d5)\u00a0\u2283\u00a0\u03d5(x)]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0A God-like being possesses all positive\nproperties\n\nAxiom A3\n\nP(G)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0The property of being God-like is positive\n\nCorollary C\n\n\u25ca\u2203xG(x)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Possibly, God exists\n\nAxiom A4\n\n\u2200\u03d5[P(\u03d5)\u00a0\u2283\u00a0\u25a1P(\u03d5)]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Positive properties are necessarily positive\n\nDefinition D2\n\n\u03d5 ess\nx\u00a0\u00a0\u2261\u00a0\u00a0\u03d5(x) \u2227\n\u2200\u03c8(\u03c8(x) \u2283\n\u25a1\u2200y(\u03d5(y) \u2283\n\u03c8(y)))\n\n\u00a0\u00a0An essence of an individual is a property possessed by\nit and\n\n\u00a0\u00a0necessarily implying any of its properties\n\nTheorem T2\n\n\u2200x[G(x)\u00a0\u2283\u00a0G ess\nx]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Being God-like is an essence of any God-like\nbeing\n\nDefinition D3\n\nNE(x)\u00a0\u2261\u00a0\u2200\u03d5[\u03d5\ness x \u2283 \u25a1\u2203y\u03d5(y)]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Necessary existence of an individual is the necessary\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 exemplification of all its essences\n\nAxiom A5\n\nP(NE)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Necessary existence is a positive property\n\nTheorem T3\n\n\u25a1\u2203xG(x)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Necessarily, God exists\n\n\nThe proof has recently been analysed to an unprecedented degree of\ndetail and precision by Benzm\u00fcller & Paleo 2014 with the help\nof automated theorem provers. A major challenge faced by these authors\nwas the lack of a HOML-based theorem prover that could carry out the\nwork but this was circumvented by embedding the logic into the\nclassical higher-order logic (HOL) already offered by existing theorem\nprovers like LEO-II, Satallax and the countermodel finder Nitpick.\nDetails of the syntactic and semantic embedding are given in their\npaper and it consists of encoding HOML formulas as HOL predicates via\nmappings, expansions, and \u03b2\u03b7-conversions.

First, G\u00f6del\u2019s set of original assumptions was shown to\nbe inconsistent by LEO-II by proving that self-difference becomes an\nessential property of every entity; a re-formulation of the definition\nof essence due to Dana Scott\u2014this involved the addition of a\nmissing conjunct, \u03d5X, in the definition\u2014was shown\nby Nitpick to be consistent. Second, LEO-II and Satallax managed to\nprove C, T1 and T2 using only the logic system K and, moreover,\nNitpick found a counter-model for T3 in K thus showing that more\nlogical power is required to complete the rest of the proof. Third,\nusing LEO-II and Satallax, it is shown that the logic system KB\n(system K with the Brouwer axiom) is sufficient to establish the\nnecessity of God\u2019s existence,\n\u25a1\u2022\u2203\u2022X\u03bc\u00a0.\u00a0g\u03bc\u2192\u03c3\u00a0X,\nwhich is a double-win for automated reasoning: a gain in logical\neconomy, and the deeper philosophical result of having effectively\ndismissed a major criticism against G\u00f6del\u2019s proof, namely his use\nof the stronger logic system S5. Fourth, the authors also prove in KB\nthat:\n\n\u2200\u2022\u03d5\u03bc\u2192\u03c3\u00a0.\u2200\u2022X\u03bc\u00a0.\u00a0(g\u03bc\u2192\u03c3\u00a0X\u00a0\u2283\u2022\u00a0(~\u2022(p(\u03bc\u2192\u03c3)\u2192\u03c3\u00a0\u03d5)\u00a0\u2283\u2022\u00a0~\u2022(\u03d5X)))\n\n\nas well as:\n\n\u2200\u2022X\u03bc\u00a0.\u2200\u2022Y\u03bc\u00a0.\u00a0(g\u03bc\u2192\u03c3\u00a0X\u00a0\u2283\u2022\u00a0(g\u03bc\u2192\u03c3\u00a0Y\u00a0\u2283\u2022\u00a0X\u00a0=\u2022\u00a0Y)),\n\n\nthat is, that God is flawless and that monotheism holds, respectively.\nAt this point, it would be fair to say that any of these results would\nbe enough to vindicate the application of automated reasoning in exact\nphilosophy. Now, for the bad news followed by good news: Fifth, the\nformula\ns\u03c3\u00a0\u2283\u2022\u00a0\u25a1\u2022s\u03c3\ncan also be formally derived which is unfortunate since it implies\nthat there are no contingent truths and that everything is determined,\ni.e. there is no free will. However, the issue has been addressed by\nfollow-up work based on Fitting\u2019s and Anderson\u2019s variants of the\nontological argument (Fuenmayor & Benzm\u00fcller 2017, Fitting\n2002, Anderson 1990). \n\nLeibniz\u2019s dream was to have a charateristica universalis and\ncalculus ratiocinator that would allow us to reason in\nmetaphysics and morals in much the same way as we do in geometry and\nanalysis; that is to say, to settle disputes between philosophers as\naccountants do: \u201cTo take pen in hand, sit down at the abacus\nand, having called in a friend if they want, say to each other: Let us\ncalculate!\u201d From the above applications of automated reasoning,\none would agree with the researchers when they imply that these\nresults achieve, to some extent, Leibniz\u2019s goal of a computational\nmetaphysics (Fitelson & Zalta 2007, Benzm\u00fcller & Paleo\n2014).\n\n\nA nonmonotonic theorem prover can provide the basis for a\n\u201ccomputational laboratory\u201d in which to explore and\nexperiment with different models of artificial rationality; the\ntheorem prover can be used to equip an artificial rational agent with\nan inference engine to reason and gain information about the world. In\nsuch procedural epistemology, a rational agent is\ndefeasible (i.e. nonmonotonic) in the sense that new reasoning leads\nto the acceptance of new beliefs but also to the retraction of\npreviously held beliefs in the presence of new information. At any\ngiven point in time, the agent holds a set of justified beliefs but\nthis set is open to revision and is in a continuous set of flux as\nfurther reasoning is conducted. This model better reflects our\naccepted notion of rationality than a model in which all the beliefs\nare warranted, i.e. beliefs that once are attained are never\nretracted. Actually, a set of warranted beliefs can be seen as\njustified beliefs \u201cin the limit\u201d, that is, as the ultimate\nepistemic goal in the agent\u2019s search for true knowledge about its\nworld. (Pollock 1995) offers the following definition: \n\nA set is defeasible enumerable iff there is an effective computable\nfunction f such that for each n,\nf(n) is a recursive set and the following two\nconditions hold \n\n\n1.\n(\u2200x)(x \u2208 A \u2192\n(\u2203n)(\u2200m > n) x\n\u2208 f(m)) \n\n2.\n(\u2200x)(x \u2209 A \u2192\n(\u2203n)(\u2200m > n) x\n\u2209 f(m)) \n\n\nTo compare the concepts, if A is recursively enumerable then\nthere is a sequence of recursive sets Ai such that\neach Ai is a subset of A with each\nAi growing monotonically, approaching A\nin the limit. But if A is only defeasibly enumerable then the\nAi\u2019s still approach A in the limit but\nmay not be subsets of A and approach A\nintermittently from above and below. The goal of the OSCAR Project\n(Pollock 1989) is to construct a general theory of rationality and\nimplement it in an artificial computer-based rational agent. As such,\nthe system uses a defeasible automated reasoner that operates\naccording to the maxim that the set of warranted beliefs should be\ndefeasible enumerable. OSCAR has been in the making for some time and\nthe application of automated nonmonotonic reasoning has also been used\nto extend its capabilities to reason defeasibly about perception and\ntime, causation, and decision-theoretic planning (Pollock 2006). \n",
