    "main_text": "Charles S. Peirce\n2. Charles S. Peirce\n\nPeirce worked in the algebraic tradition of Boole. His first logic\npapers appeared in 1867;\nthey simplify Boole\u2019s system, re-interpret union or logical\naddition \\(A+B\\) so that it applies also when A and B\nare not disjoint, correct several mistakes, and explore connections\nbetween logic, arithmetic, and algebra. \n\nThree years later, in his \u201cDescription of a Notation for the\nLogic of Relatives\u201d (1870) Peirce produced a major expansion of\nBoole\u2019s system. De Morgan had pointed out (De Morgan 1864) that\nthe Aristotelian syllogistic was incapable of handling such inferences\nas, \u201cIf every man is an animal, then every head of a man is a\nhead of an animal\u201d. De Morgan had introduced a logic of\nrelations, defined the converse and the contrary of a relation, and,\nfor relations such as \u201cX is a lover of Y\u201d\nand \u201cZ is a servant of W\u201d, had explored such\ncompositions of relations as \u201cx is the lover of a servant\nof y\u201d. This work successfully expanded the Aristotelian\nsyllogistic logic, but was also limited in several ways. First, De\nMorgan only operated with binary relations. Secondly, his notation was\nclumsy. (For example: if \\(X\\pdot\\pdot LY\\) designates that X\nis a lover of Y, then \\(X\\pdot LY\\) designates that X is\nnot a lover of Y. De Morgan has no separate sign for negation,\nnor for the Boolean propositional connectives.)\n\nPeirce noticed these shortcomings, and in 1870 showed how to extend\nBoole\u2019s logic to cover \n\n\nthe whole realm of formal logic, instead of being restricted to that\nsimplest and least useful part of the subject, the logic of absolute\nterms, which, when [Boole] wrote, was the only formal logic known.\n\n\n\nHe studied the composition of relations with each other and with\nclass-terms, and worked out the principal laws for the resulting\nabstract algebraic system, ultimately showing that the linear\nassociative algebras studied by his father (Benjamin Peirce, the\nHarvard mathematician) could all be defined in terms of what he called\n\u201celementary relatives\u201d. His 1870 system, although a large\nadvance both on Boole and on De Morgan, remains notationally awkward,\nand in retrospect it is clear that it needed the theory of\nquantification. But it was the first successful attempt to extend\nBoole\u2019s system into the logic of relations.\n\nIn 1880 Peirce described the procedure for reducing formulae of the\nsentential calculus to conjunctive and disjunctive normal form, and\nalso in unpublished work demonstrated that the sentential calculus can\nbe obtained from the single connective of joint denial (\u201cneither\np nor q\u201d). His 1881, \u201cOn the Logic of\nNumber\u201d, examined the foundations of arithmetic, and analyzed\nthe natural numbers in terms of discrete, linearly ordered sets\nwithout a maximum element. He gave informal recursive definitions of\naddition and multiplication, and proved that both operations were\nassociative and commutative.\n\nIn two remarkable papers, the short note 1883 and the longer \u201cOn\nthe Algebra of Logic\u201d of 1885, he introduced a modern notation\nfor what he was the first to call the \u201cquantifier\u201d. He\nviewed his quantifiers (for which he used the symbols \\(\\Pi\\) and\n\\(\\Sigma)\\) as a generalization of the Boolean connectives, with the\nuniversal quantifier \\(\\Pi\\) being interpreted as a (possibly\ninfinite) conjunction, so that \\(\\Pi_x P(x)\\) is understood as\n\u201ca is P and b is P and c is\nP and \u2026\u201d. Similarly the existential quantifier\n\\(\\Sigma\\) is understood as a (possibly infinite) sum: \u201ca\nis P or b is P or c is P or\n\u2026\u201d. This flexible \\(\\Pi\\) and \\(\\Sigma\\) notation allowed\nhim easily to express nested quantifications to any desired depth.\nThus, in his notation, if \\(l_{ij}\\) represents \u201ci is a\nlover of j\u201d, \\(\\Sigma_i \\Sigma_j\\) \\(l_{ij}\\) tells us\nthat somebody loves somebody, whereas \\(\\Pi_i \\Sigma_j\\) \\(l_{ij}\\)\ntells us that everybody loves somebody. (The \\(\\Sigma\\) and \\(\\Pi\\)\nnotation is of course intended, in a Boolean spirit, to emphasize the\nanalogy to arithmetical sums and products.)\n\n\u201cOn the Algebra of Logic\u201d is remarkable for other reasons\nas well. It begins with an important passage (\u00a72) on the\npropositional calculus, containing the first explicit use of two truth\nvalues. Peirce then describes a decision procedure for the calculus:\n\n\n\n[T]o find whether a formula is necessarily true substitute\n\\(\\mathbf{f}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) for the letters and see whether it\ncan be supposed false by any such assignment of values. (1885: 191)\n\n\n\nHe gives a defense of material implication, and shows how to define\nnegation in terms of implication and a special symbol for absurdity.\nIn the next section (\u00a73) he treats what he calls, following the\nSchoolmen, the \u201cfirst-intentional logic of relations\u201d. It\nis here that he coins the term \u201cquantifier\u201d; the\npropositional matrix of a quantified formula he calls its\n\u201cBoolian\u201d. In this section the quantifiers range only over\nthe individuals of the universe; the \u201cfirst-intentional\nlogic\u201d is thus first-order. Here, too, he was the first to\ndiscuss the rules for transforming a quantified formula into prenex\nnormal form. The following section (\u00a74) is headed\n\u201csecond-intentional logic\u201d. There is a clear demarcation\nfrom the first-intentional logic of \u00a73. Here the quantifiers are\npermitted to range over predicates; and he uses his new notation to\nstate the modern second-order definition of identity: two objects are\nidentical just in case they satisfy the same predicates.\n\nPeirce\u2019s paper was in many respects far ahead of its time. His\nsharp distinction between propositional, first-intentional, and\nsecond-intentional logical systems was not to be equaled in clarity\nuntil Hilbert in his lectures of 1917/18. Peirce was also prescient in\nviewing the quantifiers as (possibly infinite) sums and products, a\nnotation which L\u00f6wenheim was to credit with making possible the\ndiscovery of the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem, and which was to play\na significant role in the formulation of Hilbert\u2019s\nproof-theoretic program in the 1920s. (Peirce\u2019s logical ideas\nwere well-known in continental Europe, having been taken up by Ernst\nSchr\u00f6der and given wide circulation in the three volumes of his\nAlgebra der Logik (1890\u201395).) \n\nPeirce drew these various distinctions\u2014and, in particular, the\ndistinction between first-order and second-order logic\u2014with\ngreater clarity than any logician until Hilbert\u2019s lectures in\n1917. And, unlike Hilbert, Peirce was steeped in the writings of the\nmedieval logicians. He fully appreciated the philosophical\nsignificance of the arguments about the reality of universals: this is\nclearly why he drew such a sharp differentiation between the logic of\n\u00a72 and that of \u00a73. It was thus open to him to make (or, at\nleast, to consider) a nominalist argument on behalf of first-order\nlogic, and against second-order logic. But apart from a few incidental\nremarks, he himself did not further develop his observations on\nsecond-intentional logic, and it seems likely that the modern\ndistinction between first-order and higher-order logic was a\nre-discovery made independently in 1917/18 by Hilbert, rather than\nbeing directly inspired by Peirce.\n",
