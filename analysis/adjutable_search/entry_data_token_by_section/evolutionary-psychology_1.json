    "main_text": "Evolutionary Psychology\u2019s Theory and Methods\n2. Evolutionary Psychology\u2019s Theory and Methods\n\nInfluential evolutionary psychologists, Leda Cosmides and John Tooby,\nprovide the following list of the field\u2019s theoretical tenets\n(Tooby and Cosmides 2005):\n\n The brain is a computer designed by natural selection to extract\ninformation from the environment.\n Individual human behavior is generated by this evolved computer\nin response to information it extracts from the environment.\nUnderstanding behavior requires articulating the cognitive programs\nthat generate the behavior.\n The cognitive programs of the human brain are adaptations. They\nexist because they produced behavior in our ancestors that enabled\nthem to survive and reproduce.\n The cognitive programs of the human brain may not be adaptive\nnow; they were adaptive in ancestral environments.\n Natural selection ensures that the brain is composed of many\ndifferent special purpose programs and not a domain general\narchitecture.\n Describing the evolved computational architecture of our brains\n\u201callows a systematic understanding of cultural and social\nphenomena\u201d (16\u201318).\n\n\nTenet 1 emphasizes the cognitivism that evolutionary psychologists are\ncommitted to. 1 in combination with 2 directs our attention as\nresearchers not to parts of the brain but to the programs run by the\nbrain. It is these programs\u2014psychological mechanisms\u2014that\nare products of natural selection. While they are products of natural\nselection, and hence adaptations, these programs need not be currently\nadaptive. Our behavior can be produced by underlying psychological\nmechanisms that arose to respond to particular circumstances in our\nancestors\u2019 environments. Tenet 5 presents what is often called\nthe \u201cmassive modularity thesis\u201d (see e.g. Samuels 1998;\nSamuels 2000). There is a lot packed into this tenet and we will\nexamine this thesis in some detail below in section 3. In brief,\nevolutionary psychologists maintain that there is an analogy between\norgans and psychological mechanisms or modules. Organs perform\nspecific functions well and are products of natural selection. There\nare no general purpose organs, hearts pump blood and livers detoxify\nthe body. The same goes for psychological mechanisms; they arise as\nresponses to specific contingencies in the environment and are\nselected for to the extent that they contribute to the survival and\nreproduction of the organism. Just as there are no general purpose\norgans, there are no general purpose psychological mechanisms.\nFinally, tenet 6 introduces the reductionist or foundational vision of\nevolutionary psychology, discussed above.\n\nThere are numerous examples of the kinds of mechanisms that are\nhypothesized to underlie our behavior on the basis of research guided\nby these theoretical tenets: the cheater-detection module; the\nmind-reading module; the waist/hip ratio detection module; the snake\nfear module and so on. A closer look at the waist/hip ratio detection\nmodule illustrates the above theoretical tenets at work. Devendra\nSingh (Singh 1993; Singh and Luis 1995) presents the waist/hip ratio\ndetection module as one of the suite of modules that underlies mate\nselection in humans. This one is a specifically male psychological\nmechanism. Men detect variations in waist/hip ratio in women.\nMen\u2019s preferences are for women with waist/hip ratios closer to\n.7. Singh claims that the detection and preference suite are\nadaptations for choosing fertile mates. So our mate selection behavior\nis explained in part by the underlying psychological mechanism for\nwaist/hip ratio preference that was selected for in earlier human\nenvironments.\n\nWhat is important to note about the research guided by these\ntheoretical tenets above is that all behavior is best explained in\nterms of underlying psychological mechanisms that are adaptations for\nsolving a particular set of problems that humans faced at one time in\nour ancestry. Also, evolutionary psychologists stress that the\nmechanisms they focus on are universally distributed in humans and are\nnot susceptible to much, if any, variation. They maintain that the\nmechanisms are a product of adaptation but are no longer under\nselection (Tooby and Cosmides 2005, 39\u201340). Clark\nBarrett\u2019s (2015) accessible and wide ranging introduction to\nevolutionary psychology sustains this emphasis on evolved mechanisms\nas the main focus of evolutionary psychology research. Barrett also\nexpands the scope of evolutionary psychology and notes the addition of\nresearch methods developed since Cosmides and Tooby first set out the\nparameters for research in the field. Some of Barrett\u2019s\nproposals are discussed in sections 6 and 7 below. Todd Shackleford\nand Viviana Weekes-Shackleford (2017) have just completed a huge\ncompendium of work in the evolutionarily based psychological sciences.\nIn this volume a vast array of different research methods are\npresented and defended and there are a number of entries comparing the\nmerits of alternative approaches to evolutionary psychology.\n\nThe methods for testing hypotheses in evolutionary psychology come\nmostly from psychology. For example, in Singh\u2019s work, male\nsubjects are presented with drawings of women with varying waist hip\nratios and ask to give their preference rankings. In Buss\u2019s work\nsupporting several hypothesized mate selection mechanisms, he\nperformed similar experiments on subjects, asking for their responses\nto various questions about features of desired mates (Buss 1990).\nBuss, Singh and other evolutionary psychologists emphasize the cross\ncultural validity of their results, claiming consistency in responses\nacross a wide variety of human populations. (But see Yu and Shepard\n1998; Gray et al. 2003 for different types of conflicting results to\nSingh\u2019s.) For the most part standard psychological experimental\nmethods are used to test hypotheses in evolutionary psychology. This\nhas raised questions about the extent to which the evolutionary\ncomponent of evolutionary psychologists\u2019 hypotheses is being\ntested (see e.g. Shapiro and Epstein 1998; Lloyd 1999; Lloyd and\nFeldman 2002). A response profile may be prevalent in a wide variety\nof subject populations but this says nothing about whether or not the\nresponse profile is a psychological mechanism that arose from a\nparticular selective regimen.\n",
