    "main_text": "The Structure and Function of Consciousness\n5. The Structure and Function of Consciousness\n\nOne strategy for bringing consciousness into the scientific fold is to\ntry to articulate a theoretical basis for connecting the observable\ncharacteristics of animals (behavioral or neurological) to\nconsciousness.  What effects should consciousness have on behavior?\nWhat capacities and dispositions should we expect a conscious creature\nto have that might be absent in a nonconscious creature?  What\nneurophysiological structures and processes might realize the dynamics\nor information processing required for consciousness?\n\n Such an approach is nascent in Griffin\u2019s attempts to force\nethologists to pay attention to questions about animal consciousness,\nin all its senses \u2014 including phenomenal consciousness. In a\nseries of books, Griffin (who made his scientific reputation by\ncarefully detailing the physical and physiological characteristics of\necholocation by bats) provides examples of communicative and\nproblem-solving behavior by animals, particularly under natural\nconditions, and argues that these are prime places for ethologists to\nbegin their investigations of animal consciousness (Griffin 1976,\n1984, 1992).\n Although he thinks that the intelligence displayed by these\nexamples suggests conscious thought, many critics have been\ndisappointed by the lack of systematic connection between Griffin\u2019s\nexamples and the attribution of consciousness (see, e.g., Alcock 1992).\nGriffin\u2019s main positive\nproposal in this respect has been the rather implausible suggestion\nthat consciousness might have the function of compensating for limited\nneural machinery.  Thus Griffin is motivated to suggest that\nconsciousness may be more important to honey bees than to humans.\n\n\nIf compensating for small sets of neurons is not a plausible function\nfor consciousness, what might be? The commonsensical answer would be\nthat consciousness \u201ctells\u201d the organism about events in\nthe environment, or, in the case of pain and other proprioceptive\nsensations, about the state of the body. But this answer begs the\nquestion against opponents of attributing conscious states to animals\nfor it fails to respect the distinction between phenomenal\nconsciousness and mere awareness (in the uncontroversial sense of\ndetection) of environmental or bodily events. Opponents of attributing\nphenomenal consciousness to animals are not committed to denying the\nmore general kind of consciousness of various external and\nbodily events, so there is no logical entailment from awareness of\nthings in the environment or the body to animal sentience.\n\n\nPerhaps more sophisticated attempts to spell out the functions of\nconsciousness are similarly doomed. But Allen & Bekoff (1997, ch.\n8) suggest that progress might be made by investigating the capacities\nof animals to adjust to their own perceptual errors. Not all\nadjustments to error provide grounds for suspecting that consciousness\nis involved, but in cases where an organism can adjust to a perceptual\nerror while retaining the capacity to exploit the content of the\nerroneous perception, then there may be a robust sense in which the\nanimal internally distinguishes its own appearance states from other\njudgments about the world. (Humans, for instance, have conscious\nvisual experiences that they know are misleading \u2014 i.e., visual\nillusions \u2014 yet they can exploit the erroneous content of these\nexperiences for various purposes, such as deceiving others or\nanswering questions about how things appear to them.) Given\nthat there are theoretical grounds for identifying conscious\nexperiences with \u201cappearance states\u201d, attempts to discover\nwhether animals have such capacities might be a good place to start\nlooking for animal consciousness. It is important, however, to\nemphasize that such capacities are not themselves intended to be\ndefinitive or in any way criterial for consciousness.\n\nCarruthers (2000) makes a similar suggestion about the function of\nconsciousness, relating it to the general capacity for making an\nappearance-reality distinction; of course, he continues to maintain\nthat this capacity depends upon having conceptual resources that are\nbeyond the grasp of nonhuman animals.\n\nThe broad issue of function is closely related to questions about just\nwhat sort of mental process consciousness is. As we shall see in the\nnext section, hypotheses in the modern literature on the distribution\nand evolution of consciousness are therefore generally advanced\ntogether with theories of its structure and function in the following\nsenses:\n\n\nStructure: what are the contents of consciousness (what information,\nrepresentations, intentional contents, properties, processes,\netc. does it include)? What (possibly unconscious or subconscious)\ninformation, representations, or other cognitive or intentional\nprocesses, entities and relations, are required for consciousness?\n\n\nFunction: how does consciousness relate to other (nonconscious)\nprocesses, in cognition, the body and the environment? How does\npossessing consciousness contribute to an animal\u2019s ability to navigate\nand respond adaptively to its environment, to survive and thrive?\n\n Different views about what consciousness is, qua cognitive\nprocess, and how it relates to other biological processes such as\nbehavior, development and ecological interaction, largely determine\nbiologically oriented views about which animals have consciousness and\nwhen, how, and why it evolved. To illustrate this, we can start with a\ncrude distinction between views that see consciousness as fundamental\nto the basic perceptual and cognitive processes involved in\ncontrolling an animal body, or as something that can be added on or\nplugged in to a system that is already sufficient for basic control of\nperception-guided action. The more fundamental consciousness is to\nbasic animal functioning, the more widely distributed and ancient\nconsciousness must be; if, however, consciousness is relatively\nmodular, functionally narrow, and conceptually high level, then it\nshould be narrowly distributed among animals and relatively recently\nevolved. The views surveyed in the following section all exploit the\nconnections between function, structure, distribution and evolutionary\norigin.  \n One further point worth noting is that structural models of\nconsciousness are usually justified in terms of phenomenological or\nintrospective observations \u2014 i.e. observations about the nature\nof consciousness as it is experienced by the subject. Though the use\nof such first person methods is now and has been controversial in\npsychology and philosophy throughout the 20th and 21st century, there\nseems to now be a broad acknowledgement that it has an indispensable\nrole in the scientific study of consciousness, as many authors who\nhave published recent scientific theories of consciousness include\nsome appeal to phenomenological premises in justifying their views\n(e.g. Seth, Edelman and Baars 2005; Merker 2005; Tononi 2008; Cabanac\net al. 2009).\n",
