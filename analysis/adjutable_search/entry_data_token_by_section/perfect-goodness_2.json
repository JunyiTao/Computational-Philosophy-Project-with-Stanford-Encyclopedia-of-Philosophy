Is perfect goodness, whether necessary or contingent, actually exemplified?\n\nWe are investigating perfect goodness in the context of its\nexemplification in an absolutely perfect being. Whether we should\nthink perfect goodness is actually exemplified in an absolutely\nperfect being will depend not only on whether we think that some being\nexemplifies perfect goodness but also on whether we think that being\nexemplifies the other perfections, say, omniscience and omnipotence.\n(One might think that perfect goodness presupposes omniscience and\nomnipotence \u2013 that perfect goodness requires complete knowledge,\nperfect freedom, and full effectiveness.) That task would require\nconsideration of the various arguments within philosophical theology\nfor the existence of an absolutely perfect being \u2013 the\nontological, cosmological, teleological,\nand moral arguments, among others \u2013 as well as various\narguments that no such arguments are required for such belief to be\nrational and perhaps even warranted. (See the entries on\n ontological arguments,\n the\n cosmological argument,\n moral arguments, and\n teleological arguments\n for God\u2019s existence.)\n\nIt is worth noting, though, that there is a crucial argument that\ntypically relies on perfect goodness (understood as perfect moral\ngoodness) as a perfection in order to argue that there is no\nabsolutely perfect being. This is the argument from evil, which holds\nthat because the world contains evil (or evil of some specific type,\nor of some amount, or distributed in some way), then this world is not\nunder the control of an absolutely perfect \u2013 at least,\nomniscient, omnipotent, and morally perfect \u2013 being. There is a\nmassive classical and contemporary literature on the problem of evil;\nconsideration of formulations of the argument from evil and of\nattempts to reconcile the existence of evil and the existence of an\nabsolutely perfect being is beyond the scope of this article. (But see\nentry on\n the problem of evil.)\n\nThe argument from evil typically employs a lemma that an omniscient,\nomnipotent being is not justified in allowing the sorts of evil that\nwe find in the world. But one might make an even stronger claim, and\nhold that even if an omniscient, omnipotent being were fully justified\nin creating the world as it is, that being is nevertheless not morally\nperfect, just because that being\u2019s agency is marred by being the\nactive or permissive cause of that which is intrinsically disvaluable\n(Graves 2012). It is a controverted question whether one\u2019s\nagency can be judged to be in any way morally worse simply because it\nbrings about something bad, even something very bad. No one should\ndoubt that one can judge facts involving agency to be in some\nway bad if the agency brings about something bad; one might\nregret that the bad was brought about, or that the world was\nsuch that the bad\u2019s being brought about was the best of the\noptions available. What is doubtful is that this is any basis for\njudging the agency in question to be in any way morally bad.\n\n\nConsider an analogy. We look at the career of an executive and we see\nthat her career includes an occasion on which she laid off a dozen\nworkers, costing them their jobs with the company but offering them an\nextensive severance package. Does that fact all by itself\nshow that she was in any way less than a perfect executive? Does it\nmar her career? It is hard to see how; if she was brought on board to\ndeal with a company in severe trouble, and laying off that dozen\nworkers while offering them an extensive severance package really was\nthe best possible response that the executive could have made to a\nproblem not of her own making, it is hard to see how this event counts\nagainst her perfection as an executive. What marks one as a good\nexecutive is how one deals with the opportunities and challenges that\none has available to one; it is not affected by the range of\nopportunities and challenges themselves (except, of course, insofar as\nthat range is up to one\u2019s one making). \n\nSimilarly, what makes agency morally good, one might say, is its\nresponsiveness to what is valuable; it is in no way made worse simply\nbecause the options available each contain some regrettable features.\nBut the idea that God\u2019s agency is marred simply because the\nworld contains bad presupposes that God\u2019s agency is in some way\nmarred on account of features of the options of choice rather than on\naccount of God\u2019s orientation to what is valuable. (We will\nconsider issues related to this one in the next section in the context\nof the possibility that there is no intrinsic maximum of moral\ngoodness of agency.) \n",
