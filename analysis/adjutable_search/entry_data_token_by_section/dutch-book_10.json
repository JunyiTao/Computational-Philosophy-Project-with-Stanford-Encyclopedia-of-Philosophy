    "main_text": "Diachronic Dutch Book Arguments || Jeffrey Conditionalization\n4.2 Jeffrey Conditionalization\n\nJeffrey proposes a further Generalized Conditionalization Rule (also\ntermed Probability Kinematics or Jeffrey\nConditionalization) to cover cases in which experience does not\nmanifest itself in some evidential proposition \\(E\\)\nshifting to one, but rather stems from a shift in probabilities over\nsome partition \\(\\{E_{i}\\}\\) (Jeffrey 1983). Jeffrey\u2019s Rule\nstates that \n\n\\[ \\pr_2(A) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\pr_1(A \\mid E_i) \\pr_2(E_i), \\]\n\n\nwhich is equivalent to the invariance condition that \\(pr_1(A\\mid E_i)\n= pr_2(A\\mid E_i)\\), for each element \\(E_i\\) of the partition. To\nmaintain that updating goes by Jeffrey Conditionalization is to\nmandate invariance for each proposition \\(A\\). This\nmight seem to be required, as Armendt shows that a Dutch Strategy can\nbe constructed against an agent who has a rule for updating that\nconflicts with Jeffrey\u2019s Rule (Armendt 1980). As with the Rule\nof Conditionalization though, the Dutch Strategy does not show that\nthere is any problem with having probabilities over a partition, and\nthen abandoning one\u2019s prior conditional probabilities over that\npartition, that is violating invariance; the problem is with adopting\na rule of this sort in advance. As with the simple Rule of\nConditionalization, Skyrms (1987b) shows that there is also a converse\nDutch Strategy argument showing that following Jeffrey\u2019s Rule\navoids a Dutch Book.  It is built in here that Jeffrey\u2019s Rule\napplies in cases in which credences shift over a partition, but as\nbefore if the agent\u2019s learning scenario does not form a partition,\nGallow (2019) shows that, as with the Simple Conditionalization,\nJeffrey Conditionalizers may be subject to a Dutch Strategy as\nwell. \n\nWhile the Rule of Conditionalization is generally presented as\ndemanding that agents satisfy invariance for each proposition, and\nvarious authors have rightly complained that this demands an\nunreasonable rigidity of belief (Bacchus, Kyburg, and Thalos 1990;\nLevi 2002), Jeffrey does not treat the condition as a strict\nrequirement on rational belief change (Jeffrey 2004). He leaves open\nthe possibility that when probabilities are shifted over a partition,\nthe conditional probabilities could change, although this leaves the\nunanswered question as to when invariance is reasonable to assume. In\nany case, as with the Simple Rule of Conditionalization, the Dutch\nStrategy argument here tells in the same way against planned\nviolations of invariance.  \n",
