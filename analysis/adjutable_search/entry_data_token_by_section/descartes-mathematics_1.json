    "main_text": "The Background to Descartes\u2019 Mathematical Researches || The Construction of Curves and the Solution to Geometrical Problems\n1.1 The Construction of Curves and the Solution to Geometrical Problems\n\nPappus\u2019s claims regarding the proper methods for constructing\ngeometrical curves are couched in terms of the ancient classification\nof geometrical problems, which he famously describes in Book III of\nthe Collection:\n\n\nThe ancients stated that there are three kinds of geometrical\nproblems, and that some are called plane, others solid, and others\nline-like; and those that can be solved by straight lines and the\ncircumference of a circle are rightly called plane because the lines\nby means of which these problems are solved have their origin in the\nplane. But such problems that must be solved by assuming one or more\nconic sections in the construction, are called solid because for their\nconstruction it is necessary to use the surfaces of solid figures,\nnamely cones. There remains a third kind that is called line-like. For\nin their construction other lines than the ones just mentioned are\nassumed, having an inconstant and changeable origin, such as spirals,\nand the curves that the Greeks call tetragonizousas\n[\u201csquare-making\u201d], and which we call\n\u201cquandrantes,\u201d and conchoids, and cissoids, which have\nmany amazing properties (Pappus 1588, III, \u00a77; translation from\nBos 2001, 38).\n\n\nWe notice in the above remarks that Pappus bases his classification of\ngeometrical problems on the construction of the curves necessary for\nthe solution of a problem: If a problem is solved by a curve\nconstructible by straightedge and compass, it is planar; if a problem\nis solved by a curve constructible by conic section, it is solid; and\nif a problem is solved by a curve that requires a more complicated\nconstruction\u2014that has an \u201cinconstant and changeable\norigin\u201d\u2014, it is line-like. Though a seemingly\nstraightforward directive for how to classify geometrical problems,\nthere remained an ambiguity in Pappus\u2019s text about whether the\nso-called solid and line-like problems\u2014problems that required\nthe construction of conics and more complicated curves, such as the\nspiral\u2014were in fact solvable by genuinely geometrical methods.\nThat is, there was an ambiguity, and thus, an open question for early\nmodern mathematicians, about whether problems that could not be solved\nby straightedge and compass construction met the rigorous standards of\ngeometry. (For the special status of constructions by straightedge and\ncompass in Greek mathematics, see Heath (1921) and Knorr (1986). For\nhelpful overviews of the historical development of Greek mathematics,\nsee classics such as Merzbach and Boyer (2011) and volume 1 of Kline\n(1972).)\n\nA few examples will help clarify what is at stake here. The problem of\nbisecting a given angle is counted among planar problems, because, as\ndetailed by Euclid in Elements I.9, to construct the line\nsegment that divides a given angle into two equal parts, we construct\n(by compass) three circles of equal radius, and then (by straightedge)\njoin the vertex of the angle with the point at which the circles\nintersect (Euclid 1956, Volume I, 264\u2013265). Notice here that, to\ngenerate the solution, curves are used to construct a point that gives\nthe solution to the problem, namely, by constructing the circles, we\nidentify a point that allows us to bisect the curve. (When dealing\nwith locus problems, such as the Pappus problem, the curves that are\nconstructed are themselves the solution to the problem. See\n section 3\n below.) The problem of trisecting an angle, on the other hand, was\nconsidered a line-like problem, because its solution required the\nconstruction of curves, such as the spiral, which were not\nconstructible by straightedge and compass. Perhaps most famous among\nline-like problems is that of squaring the circle; for those who\ndeemed this problem solvable, the solution required the construction\nof a curve such as the quadratrix, a curve that was proposed by the\nancients in order to solve this very problem (which is how the curve\nreceived its name). Certainly, the generation of such curves could be\ndescribed; Archimedes famously describes the generation of the spiral\nin Definition 1 of his Spirals and Pappus describes the\ngeneration of the quadratrix in Book IV of the Collection.\nHowever, these descriptions were considered \u201cmore\ncomplicated\u201d precisely because they go beyond the intersection\nof curves that are generated by straightedge and compass construction.\nFor instance, according to Archimedes, the spiral is generated by\nuniformly moving a line segment around a given point while tracing the\npath of a point that itself moves uniformly along the line segment.\nAnd, according to Pappus, the quadratrix is generated by the uniform\nmotions of two line segments, where one segment moves around the\ncenter of a given circle and the other moves through a quadrant of the\ncircle. (Cf. Bos 2001, 40\u201342 for the details of both these\nconstructions.) In a similar vein, the construction of conics was\nconsidered more complicated: One of the accepted techniques for\nconstructing a conic required cutting a cone in a specified way, which\nagain, went beyond the consideration of intersecting curves that were\nconstructible by straightedge and compass.\n\nIn the Collection, Pappus does not offer a firm verdict on\nwhether the conics and \u201cmore complicated\u201d curves meet the\nrigorous standards of geometrical construction and hence, on whether\nthey are admissible in the domain of geometry. In the case of the\nconics, he relies on Apollonius\u2019s commentary and reports the\nusefulness of these curves for the synthesis (or proofs) of some\nproblems (Pappus, 116). However, to claim a curve useful is quite\ndifferent from claiming it can be constructed by properly geometrical\nmethods (as we\u2019ll see more clearly below). Moreover, in the case\nof the quadratrix, Pappus sets out the description of the curve in\nBook IV of the Collection, and then immediately proceeds to\nidentify the common objections to the curve\u2019s description, e.g.,\nthat there is a petitio principii in the very definition of\nthe curve, without commenting on whether these objections can be\novercome. Thus, although it was known by the ancients that conics and\nother complicated curves could be used to solve outstanding problems,\nit was not clear to early modern mathematicians whether the ancients\nconsidered these solutions genuinely geometrical. In other words, it\nwas not clear from Pappus\u2019s Collection whether these\ncurves were admissible in geometrical problem-solving and therefore,\nwhether solid problems (such as identifying the mean proportionals\nbetween given line segments) or line-like problems (such as trisecting\nan angle and squaring the circle) had genuine geometrical\nsolutions.\n\nConsequently, after the publication of Commandino\u2019s translation\nof the Collection, early modern mathematicians gave added\nattention to the questions of whether and why these curves should be\nused in geometrical problem-solving. The spiral and quadratrix were\nprominent in such discussions, because, as noted above, they could be\nused to address some of the more famous outstanding geometrical\nproblems, namely, angle trisection and squaring the circle.\n [2]\n For instance, in his second and expanded (1589) edition of\nEuclid\u2019s Elements (which was first published in 1574)\nas well as in his Geometria practica (1604), Christoph\nClavius discusses the status of the quadratrix. Accepting the\nobjections to the description of the quadratrix detailed by Pappus in\nthe Collection, Clavius supplies what he deems a \u201ctruly\ngeometrical\u201d construction of the curve that would legitimize its\nuse in geometrical problem-solving, and in solving the problem of\nsquaring the circle in particular. His construction is a pointwise\none: We begin with a quadrant of a circle (as in Pappus\u2019s\ndescription) but rather than relying on the intersection of uniformly\nmoving segments to describe the curve, Clavius proceeds by first\nidentifying the points of intersection between segments that bisect\nthe quadrant and segments that bisect the arc of the quadrant. That\nis, we identify the several intersecting points of segments which are\nconstructible by straightedge and compass, and then, to generate the\nquadratrix, we connect the (arbitrarily many) intersecting points,\nwhich are evenly spaced along the sought after curve. Therefore, to\nconstruct the quadratrix according to Clavius\u2019s method, we still\ngo beyond basic straightedge and compass constructions (connecting the\npoints in this case cannot be done by straightedge, as in the case of\nbisection), but one need not consider the simultaneous motions of\nlines as Pappus\u2019s construction requires. (See Bos 2001,\n161\u2013162 for Clavius\u2019s construction of the quadratrix and\ncompare with Pappus\u2019s construction on Bos 2001, 40\u201342. For\nDescartes\u2019 assessment of Clavius\u2019s pointwise construction\nsee\n section 3.3\n below.)\n\nAccording to Clavius\u2019s commentary of 1589, this pointwise\nconstruction of the quadratrix was an improvement over that offered by\nPappus, because it was more accurate: Since the pointwise construction\nallowed one to identify arbitrarily many points along the curve, one\ncould trace the quadratrix with greater precision than if one had to\nconsider the intersection of two moving lines. To support his case,\nClavius relates his pointwise construction of the quadratrix with the\npointwise construction of conics proposed by the \u201cgreat\ngeometer\u201d Apollonius and claims that \u201cunless someone wants\nto reject as useless and ungeometrical the whole doctrine of conic\nsections\u201d proposed by Apollonius, \u201cone is forced to accept\nour present description of the [quadratrix] as entirely\ngeometrical\u201d (cited in Bos 2001, 163). However, in his later\nGeometria practica (1604), Clavius tempers his assessment of\nboth the quadratrix and the conics. He maintains that these more\ncomplicated curves could be constructed by pointwise methods that\noffered greater precision, but the curves thus generated were no\nlonger presented as absolutely geometrical. Instead, they were\npresented as \u201cmore accurate,\u201d \u201ceasier,\u201d and\ngeometrical \u201cin a certain way\u201d (Bos 2001,\n164\u20135).\n\nIn his Supplement of geometry (1593), Fran\u00e7ois\nVi\u00e8te also addresses the outstanding problems of geometry that\nwere solvable by curves that could not constructed by straightedge and\ncompass. He claims that at least some such problems could be solved by\nproperly geometrically means by adopting as his postulate that the\nso-called neusis problem could be solved. That is, he assumed that\ngiven two lines, a point \\(O\\), and a segment \\(a\\), it was possible\nto draw a straight line through \\(O\\) intersecting the two lines in\npoints \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) such that \\(AB = a\\) (Bos 2001,\n167\u2013168). In the Supplement, Vi\u00e8te shows that\nonce we accept as a fundamental geometrical postulate that the neusis\nproblem is solvable, then we can, by legitimately geometrical means,\nsolve the problems of trisecting a given angle and of constructing the\ntwo mean proportional between two given line segments. Specifically\nand importantly, we generate these solutions without having to rely on\nthe construction of conics or higher-order curves, such as the spiral\nor quadratrix (Bos 2001, 168).\n\nThe neusis postulate was a powerful tool in Vi\u00e8te\u2019s\nproblem-solving arsenal: By assuming that the neusis problem could be\nsolved, he expanded the domain of acceptable geometrical constructions\nbeyond straightedge and compass. However, questions remained about the\nacceptability of this assumption as a postulate, since Vi\u00e8te\ndoes not detail the construction of the neusis problem but simply\nclaims that the neusis postulate should not be difficult for his\nreaders to accept. In making this assumption, he was taking a\nsignificant departure from ancient geometers, for whom the neusis\nproblem could only be solved by curves that were not constructible by\nstraightedge and compass. For instance, Pappus rendered the\nconstruction of the neusis a solid problem and solved it by means of\nconics in Book IV of the Collection, and Nicomedes rendered\nthe construction of the neusis a line-like problem and devised the\ncissoid for its solution. (See Bos 2001, 53\u201354 for\nPappus\u2019s solution and 30\u201333 for Nicomedes\u2019 solution.\nSee also Pappus 1986, 112\u2013114 for the classification of the\nneusis as a sold problem.)\n\nNonetheless, according to Vi\u00e8te, if a problem could not be\nsolved by neusis, then questions of legitimacy remained. For instance,\nneither the spiral nor the quadratrix\u2014curves used to square the\ncircle by Archimedes and Pappus, respectively\u2014could be\nconstructed in the same obvious and \u201cnot difficult\u201d way as\nthe neusis. Vi\u00e8te appears to grant that the pointwise\nconstruction of the quadratrix, such as that presented by Clavius, was\nin fact more precise than other constructions of the curve, but,\nVi\u00e8te claims, this greater precision does not legitimize its\nstatus as genuinely geometrical. Indeed, such precise descriptions\nrelied on instruments and, thus, on the mechanical arts and, as such,\nwere not geometrical. Moreover, Vi\u00e8te claimed that, in general,\ncurves not constructed by the intersection of curves, such as the\nArchimedean spiral, were \u201cnot described in the way of true\nknowledge\u201d (Bos 2001, 177). Therefore, just as the quadratrix,\nthese curves were not legitimately geometrical, which left the problem\nof squaring the circle an open problem for Vi\u00e8te.\n",
