    "main_text": "Naturalism and Social Construction\n2. Naturalism and Social Construction\n\nAny discussion of naturalistic approaches to social construction is\ncomplicated by the fact that \u201cnaturalism\u201d itself has no\nvery widespread and uniform understanding (see\n Naturalism).\n Still, the prospect seems provocative, in part, because social\nconstruction has come to be associated with a critical anti-realist\nattitude towards science.\n\nAbove, we identified naturalism with a certain attitude towards\nscience, and for present purposes, we develop this idea by identifying\nthree naturalistic attitudes toward science that have been picked up\nby naturalists addressing social constructionist themes.\n\nEpistemological Fundamentalism\n\n\nAccommodating Science: Most contemporary naturalists take science\nto be an enormously successful enterprise, and so other knowledge\nclaims must either cohere with the findings of our best science or\nexplain those findings away.\nEmpiricism: Knowledge comes from careful study of the world, not a\npriori theorizing.\nCausal Modeling: The world is a set of entities related by natural\nlaws. In attempting to understand it, we produce causal models that\nidealize these relationships to varying degrees.\n\nMetaphysical Fundamentalism\n\n\nSupervenience: There are more and less fundamental entities, and\nthe less fundamental depend on the more fundamental. Naturalists\nunderstand (at least) these fundamental entities to be natural (as\nopposed to supernatural). Naturalists typically hold these fundamental\nentities to be physical entities.\nReduction: The regularities in which less fundamental entities\nparticipate are explained by natural laws governing the more\nfundamental entities upon which they supervene.\n\nHuman Naturalism:\n\n\nNonanomalism: Human beings and their products (e.g. culture or\nsociety) are natural things within the world that science explains.\nThey are not metaphysically anomalous.\nMethodological Naturalism: In studying human nature, human\nculture, and social life, the methods of the natural sciences are to\nbe employed.\n\n\n\nThese features characterize substantial threads of contemporary\nnaturalist thought\u2014threads that arise repeatedly in discussions\nof constructionism. Still, it is worth noting that something may be\nnaturalistic in one sense but not another, and that the various\nthreads we have characterized may sometimes be at odds. For example,\nrational choice explanations in economics might count as naturalist in\nthat they attempt to reduce complex macro-level phenomena to simple,\nmicro-level phenomena at the level of individuals (exhibiting some\nvariety of metaphysical fundamentalism), and in the sense that they\nemploy idealized causal modeling to do so (as in 1c). But they seem\nnonnaturalist insofar as they offer a highly idealized account of\nhuman behavior, one that seems frequently contradicted by the\npsychological facts about human reasoning (see, e.g., Nisbett and Ross\n1980, Tversky and Kahneman, 1974) (against, perhaps, 1a and b, and\n3).\n\nWe now review various naturalistic approaches to social construction,\nconsidering different sorts of entities in turn.\n",
