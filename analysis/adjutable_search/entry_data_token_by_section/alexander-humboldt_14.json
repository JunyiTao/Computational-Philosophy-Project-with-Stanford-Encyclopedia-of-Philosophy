    "main_text": "Naturgem\u00e4lde\n6. Naturgem\u00e4lde \n\nHumboldt coined the term Naturgem\u00e4ldeto describe the\nworks of authors he regards as having achieved truth to nature, and\nhis own works, including the essays he published in Ansichten der\nNatur. He also used it to translate the French tableau,\nwhich he had originally applied to describe his drawing of Chimborazo.\nIn that context, and as noted above, tableau refers to two\ndifferent media\u2014the plate and the text, each of which supports\nand illuminates the other. The plate offers a visual presentation of a\nparticular landscape and its inhabitants through a cross-sectional\nprofile of the Andes from the Atlantic to the Pacific at the latitude\nof Chimborazo. It also includes information about animals and plants\nat different altitudes. The text provides further information about\nthe landscape, draws analogies, and makes connections more explicit.\nThe aim, Humboldt writes, is \n\n\nto gather in one single tableau the sum of the physical phenomena\npresent in equinoctial regions, from the sea level of the South Sea to\nthe very highest peak of the Andes. \n\n\nBy integrating the two media, Humboldt\u2019s aim is to enliven\n\u201cboth our imagination and our spirit at the same time\u201d,\nand in this way \u201cstimulate people to study\u201d (DA 1: 71;\nEGP: 79\u201380).\n\nSimilarly, Humboldt\u2019s essays employ different modes of\npresentation\u2014the personal, the scientific, the literary and the\nphilosophical\u2014with the goal of, as he puts it,\n\u201coccupy[ing] the imagination and at the same time, through the\nincrease of knowledge, enrich[ing] life with ideas\u2026\u201d (DA\n5: xi; VN: 27). In both instances, the outcome is a new genre, which\ninterweaves science and art, and draws on aesthetic pleasure and\nexperience to incite reflection and careful observation, and vice\nversa.\n\nHumboldt opens Ansichten der Natur with the essay that he\nlater described as his most \u201cdaring\u201d (DA 5: 128; VN: 117).\nTitled \u201c\u00dcber die Steppen und W\u00fcsten\n[Concerning the Steppes and Deserts]\u201d, it begins by situating\nthe reader, imaginatively placing her in a particular spot: the foot\nof a high granite mountain\u2014or as Humboldt describes it, a\ngranite spine. Immediately, the reader is invited not only to\npicture the mountain, but also to stand at its foot.\nFrom there her gaze turns southward, and rests on \u201ca broad,\nimmeasurable plain\u201d, the steppes or llanos. What the reader sees\nis not a God\u2019s eye-view of the landscape, but the steppes as\nthey appear from a particular angle. This angle colors her impression.\nThe steppes seem to \u201cclimb and dwindle into the\nhorizon\u201d. Having walked to the steppes from the lush valleys of\nCaracas, the reader is also struck by the sudden change in landscape\nfrom the \u201cluxuriant fullness of organic life\u201d to\n\u201cthe barren edge of a sparse and treeless desert\u2026\u201d\nand feels astonished (DA 5: 3; VN: 29).\n\nIn this opening paragraph, Humboldt makes no mention of himself. The\nreader presumes, however, that what is being described is the path\nthat Humboldt had trodden, and the view he had seen. However, by the\nend of the paragraph, any evidence of Humboldt, the explorer,\ndisappears and in his place stands the \u201castonished\nwanderer\u201d. That Humboldt invokes the astonished\nwanderer\u2014rather than himself\u2014allows the reader to take on\nthe perspective of the wanderer, to imaginatively become the\nwanderer. In turn, by appealing to all of the reader\u2019s senses,\nher feelings and imagination, as well as her body, Humboldt\u2019s\nessay invites the reader to imaginatively walk from the verdant\nvalleys to the strikingly barren steppes; to watch the clouds\nthickening overhead, portending months of rain, and sense the\nconstriction in the atmosphere; to smell the oncoming deluge, and\nobserve with wonder the changed behavior of the animals. In reading\nthese descriptions, the reader does not only think about a\nparticular aspect of nature, nor does she simply see it from\na specific standpoint. She also imagines herself in\nthe landscape, experiencing it in an embodied and emotive way.\n\nInterwoven with vivid descriptions of embodied experience are careful\nobservations and detailed measurements of various natural phenomena,\nas well as comparative, historical and geographical analyses. The\ntechnical details and scientific explanations are not separated from\nthe embodied experiences, but emerge from them. This is particularly\nclear in Humboldt\u2019s description of an internal sense of\n\u201cconstriction\u201d in relation to a shift in atmospheric\npressure preceding an electric storm. In this passage, which Humboldt\nincludes in other works\u2014and which is mentioned in reference\nworks on electrical\n storms[1]\u2014he\n offers both a detailed account of the atmosphere prior to an\nelectrical storm, pointing to the various elements that contribute to\nthe physical transformations, and the experience of witnessing the\ntransformation in the atmosphere. Humboldt begins by taking note of\nthe low-hanging clouds, the narrowing of the horizon, the thickening\nof the air, and the smothering heat and dust. He proceeds to describe\nthe experience of witnessing these events, highlighting the ways in\nwhich the shifts in the atmosphere are connected to a shift in the\nwanderer\u2019s mood. By the end of the analysis, Humboldt writes\nthat the wanderer experiences a sense of \u201cconstriction\u201d\nwhich, while felt internally, has its source in the\natmosphere itself, and is thus an expression of (a human way of\npresenting) the atmospheric event. As Humboldt puts it, \u201cIt\nconstricts the steppe and the mood of the wanderer as well\u201d (DA\n5: 14; VN: 37).\n\nHumboldt\u2019s detailed description of the shift in the atmosphere\nallows the reader to imaginatively experience what it is like to stand\nin the midst of an oncoming electrical storm. Thus, by the time that\nthe reader is told about the feeling of constriction, she is\nalready gripped by this feeling. In this way, the reader recognizes\nthat there is nothing random about the internally felt sense of\nconstriction: it is inspired by the natural process and\nreveals something\u2014via the medium of feeling\u2014about it.\n\nFor this reason, critics have argued that Humboldt\u2019s description\nof the electric storm realizes the goal he set out, achieving\n\u201ctruth to nature\u201d (Nassar 2022). While this passage is not\nunique in Humboldt\u2019s writings, it is the most explicit and\nconcise demonstration of Humboldt\u2019s \u201cdual\ndirection\u201d: it conveys aesthetic feeling and enriches\nour understanding of a natural phenomenon\u2014seamlessly moving from\none to the other.\n",
