    "main_text": "Revolutionary Jus in Bello\n4. Revolutionary Jus in Bello\n\nPrinciples of jus in bello specify what kinds of particular\nactions are permissible in making war. Two standards feature\nprominently in discussions of jus in bello. First is\nproportionality, which holds that the specific acts or tactics\nemployed in war must promote the good to such a degree that it\noutweighs the \u201cbads\u201d or harms or rights-infringements of\nthe act or tactic. Second is discrimination, which is typically\nunderstood in terms of non-combatant immunity\u2014innocents are not\nliable to harms and so it is impermissible to target them. A much\ndisputed question is whether all and only civilians qualify as\ninnocents. Here it is worth noting that the original meaning of\n\u201cinnocent\u201d is one who is incapable of inflicting harm.\nSome military personnel, namely those who lack access to weapons or\nhave become incapable of using them may fit this description and some\ncivilians, namely those who supply resources to the military, may\nnot.\n\nA key issue that a theory of the morality of revolutionary war ought\nto address is whether these widely accepted jus in bello\nnorms apply without exception or modification to war-making by\nrevolutionaries or whether, instead, revolutionaries are morally\npermitted to undertake acts of war that the military personnel of\nstates are usually prohibited from performing. This is not a merely\ntheoretical issue: revolutionary warriors have often engaged in\nvarious morally problematic forms of \u201cirregular\u201d warfare.\nThey have assassinated civilian leaders and other civilians such as\ngovernment bureaucrats and judges, attacked regime forces while\nwearing civilian attire (not wearing uniforms or insignia as required\nby the laws of war and not carrying weapons openly), and engaged in\nterrorism, deliberately killing individuals who had no discernible\nconnection with the regime by detonating bombs in public places.\nFurthermore, in order to mobilize people to join the revolution or to\ndeter them from aiding the regime in suppressing it, they have engaged\nin acts of terrorism against the oppressed.\n\nThese examples of irregular tactics fall into four different\ncategories (Finlay 2015, pp. 206\u20138). First is civilian\ncamouflage, which involves combatants retaining the appearance of\ncivilians for the sole purpose of avoiding elimination prior to\ncombat. Second is civilian disguise, which, like civilian\ncamouflage, involves combatants appearing as civilians, but, unlike\ncamouflage, this misleading appearance is used to mislead the enemy\nduring combat. In an example of civilian disguise discussed by Michael\nWalzer, French partisans resisted German occupation by dressing as\npeasants and launching an ambush (Walzer 1977 p. 183). Third is\nhuman shields, a tactic where combatants deliberately locate\nmilitary targets near civilians in order to deter attack (Schmitt\n2009). Fourth, combatants can engage in non-combatant\ntargeting, a tactic that deliberately places non-combatants, e.g.\ncivilians, in harm\u2019s way for the sake of some advantage.\nExamples of non-combatant targeting include: the concealment of\ncivilians in a position close to military targets in the hopes that\nthe enemy harms them with collateral damage, provocation of the regime\nwith the intent of producing harms to civilians, or, of course,\ndeliberate targeting of locations predominantly used or occupied by\ncivilians. The aims of non-combatant targeting can range from\nmotivating the populace to join the revolutionary effort, to coercing\nthe populace into supporting the revolution, to instigating terror and\ndisorder. These irregular tactics are clearly in tension if not\noutright contradiction with jus in bello standards of\nproportionality and discrimination as they expose civilians to greater\nrisks of suffering collateral harm either by making it more difficult\nfor the enemy to discriminate between combatants and non-combatants,\nor by directly exposing non-combatants to greater harms on account of\nusing them as shields or deliberate targeting.\n\nRevolutionaries are often under powerful incentives to employ such\nirregular tactics, because they are disadvantaged relative to their\nadversaries. First, they will generally have less military training\nand less disciplined organization than regime combatants, they will be\nfewer in number, will generally have lower quality arms, and will have\ninferior logistical and intelligence capacities. Secondly,\nrevolutionaries face the challenge of mobilizing a people that has\nsuffered oppression under an unjust regime. Entrenched tyrannical\nregimes typically use their control over education and the media to\ninstill propaganda designed to prevent the people from recognizing\njust how rotten the regime is, how poorly the economy is performing,\nhow inferior the quality of life is compared with that in better\ngoverned countries, and how widespread dissatisfaction with the regime\nactually is. Hence, effective revolutionary action may require the\ndissipation of false consciousness on the part of the people. The\naspiring revolutionary leadership thus may be faced with the task of\ntrying to dismantle the false consciousness of those they hope to\nenlist in the revolutionary struggle. In actual cases, aspiring\nleaders have often used violence and sometimes terrorism in an effort\nto overcome the epistemic obstacles to widespread participation in\nrevolution. For example, they have attacked \u201csoft\ntargets\u201d\u2014policemen or government officials\u2014to\ndemonstrate to the people that \u201cwe have the power to\nhurt them\u201d. Another tactic often used by\nrevolutionaries to overcome epistemic obstacles is to provoke the\nregime to undertake brutal responses to relatively peaceful\ndemonstrations, in order to reveal to all just how ruthless the regime\nis. Such actions, which are condemned by mainstream jus in\nbello thinking, are said to be necessary to instill the sense of\nagency that false consciousness has undermined.\n\nWhile such \u201cirregular\u201d tactics are understandably\nattractive to revolutionaries, the claim that they are justified is\ngenerally regarded with a good deal of skepticism. We start by\nexamining the use of civilian camouflage and civilian disguise. These\ntactics are clearly at odds with standard requirements of\ndiscrimination, according to which combatants must wear uniforms and\nopenly carry their arms so that the enemy can distinguish them from\nnon-combatants. The intuitive appeal of the standard account of\ndiscrimination thus leads some thinkers to argue that civilian\ncamouflage and civilian disguise are impermissible because such\ntactics expose non-combatants to unjust and disproportionate risk of\ncollateral harm (Meisels 2008; Chiu 2010).\n\nThose who argue that civilian camouflage or disguise are permissible\ntypically appeal to fairness. The idea is that, at least in the early\nstages of their struggle, revolutionaries are at a great disadvantage\nvis \u00e0 vis government forces, that this disadvantage is\nsomething for which they are not responsible, and that the\nrevolutionaries should not be expected to let it render unsuccessful\ntheir struggle against a seriously unjust regime (Gross 2010:\n153\u20134). As noted earlier, revolutionaries typically have\ninferior arms and logistical capacities, they have no safe rear areas\nbehind which they can regroup and resupply because there are no battle\nlines as in conventional wars. Finlay argues that for these reasons,\ncivilian camouflage, but not disguise, is a tactic that\nrevolutionaries may permissibly employ (Finlay 2015, pp.\n211\u201312). Civilian camouflage is justified, according to Finlay,\nbecause this tactic serves only to enable revolutionaries to withdraw\ntemporarily from fighting and enabling this both restores fairness to\nthe distribution of rights and duties concerning warfare in asymmetric\ncontexts and is not inconsistent with standard laws of war. The use of\ncivilian disguise, on the other hand, is not permissible, because that\ntactic is not meant to restore fairness with respect to an ability\nnormally protected by the laws of war (i.e. the ability to withdraw\nfrom combat), but rather to diminish the ability of regular combatants\nto defend themselves (Ibid., p. 213).\n\nWhereas civilian camouflage and civilian disguise are tactics that\nonly indirectly contribute to the risk of collateral harm for\ncivilians by making discrimination between combatants and\nnon-combatants more difficult, tactics like the use of human shields\nor non-combatant targeting directly expose non-combatants to\nsignificant risks of harm for the sake of some military advantage and\nso necessarily violate the principle of non-combatant immunity. Many\ntheorists who study irregular conflicts like revolutionary war\ngenerally view such tactics as strictly impermissible.\n\nIt is important to note that critics of such irregular tactics do not\ngenerally claim that as a matter of principle irregular tactics can\nnever be justified. In the face of a \u201csupreme emergency,\u201d\nwhere failure to displace the prevailing regime would be a moral\ncatastrophe, such theorists often grant that irregular tactics that\nwould facilitate resolving the emergency may in fact be justified as a\nlesser evil. The problem lies in allowing persons waging war to judge\nfor themselves whether they occupy an exceptional, supreme emergency\nsituation. The worry is that if participants in war know that such\nexceptions are in principle available to them, then there is a serious\nrisk that their fallible judgments (perhaps shaped by various biases\nor motivated reasoning) lead them to make a wrongful exception and\nemploy tactics that are not in fact justified and which come at a\ndisproportionate harm to innocents and bystanders (Nathanson 2010, pp.\n201\u20138; Nagel 1972; Coady 2002; Coady 2004). Relatedly, one might\nworry that once one belligerent has violated the principle of\nnon-combatant immunity, opposing sides might respond by no longer\ncomplying with the norm in turn, leading to total breakdown of the\nrules of war (Waldron 2010: pp. 88\u201390).\n\nWhether the tactics in question are at risk of being abused will\nnaturally depend on the specific way in which they are employed, so it\nwill be helpful to distinguish the different kinds of non-combatant\ntargeting. First, and most extreme, is terrorism, by which we mean\ndeliberate targeting of non-combatants (for a more detailed and\nextensive discussion of terrorism, see the entry on\n terrorism).\n An example is the targeting of public places where combat is not\noccurring. The aims of such acts can include those of instilling\nterror in the populace, weakening support for the regime, or sending a\nmessage to the regime or international actors.\n\nRevolutionaries can employ tactics that target non-combatants which\nneed not be indiscriminate. Rather, they can employ a second sort of\nirregular tactic which we will call expansive discriminate\ntargeting. This tactic involves the deliberate targeting of\nnon-combatants who are taken to be morally liable to suffer harms from\nrevolutionary war. We will discuss the grounds of such liability\nshortly when we survey arguments given in defensive of irregular\ntargeting.\n\nThird, revolutionaries can rely on provocation of the enemy. The aim\nof this tactic is to provoke agents of the regime to harm\nnon-combatants with the aim of securing greater popular support for\nthe revolutionary movement. Provocation is distinct from the use of\nhuman shields in that the former is offensive whereas the latter is\ndefensive. Combatants employ human shields in the hope that the\npresence of non-combatants dissuades the enemy from launching an\nattack, whereas the intent of provoking the enemy is to have them harm\ninnocents. Fourth and last, combatants can employ coercion against\nnon-combatants with the aim of forcing them to join the revolutionary\neffort.\n\nThe argument from risk of abuse and the risk of breakdown of the rules\nof war applies to some, but not all, of these irregular tactics. These\narguments against irregular tactics are weaker when there are\nnaturally occurring incentives in place that would motivate against\nabusing the irregular tactics or against reciprocating their use and\nwhen the dominant regime does not already engage in the abuse of the\nrelevant sort of tactic. Such a situation is likely to obtain with\nregard to relatively less extreme forms of non-combatant targeting,\nnamely, expansive discriminate targeting and coercing support. In all\nlikelihood, a regime that can be the target of legitimate\nrevolutionary war is likely already employing some kind of coercion to\nbolster its ranks, which makes worries about further abuse of the\ntactic moot. Expansive discriminate targeting is also unlikely to be\nworthwhile for a dominant regime to employ because of its asymmetric\npower vis a vis the revolutionaries.\n\nRevolutionaries are unlikely to have access to established\ninstitutional structures that they can rely on to advance their war\neffort. The enemy of the regime consists of the specific members of\nthe revolutionary movement that threatens it, whereas the enemy of\nrevolutionaries is the regime as such, which is comprised not only of\npolitical officials and the combatants following orders issued by the\nofficials, but also the institutions and structures that keep the\nregime operating, and this makes an expansive understanding of\nlegitimate targets appealing for revolutionaries but not for the\nregime. By contrast, the arguments from risk of abuse and risk of\nbreakdown of the rules of war seem to hold in the case of terrorism\nand the use of human shields. Dominant regimes have some interest in\nemploying either of these tactics as the use of indiscriminate\ntargeting would counteract the likely use of civilian camouflage and\ndisguise that revolutionaries will by necessity employ, and the use of\nhuman shields would presumably be a deterrent against revolutionary\nattack (though, for a qualified defense of the use of human shields,\nsee Fabre 2012, pp. 256\u201367).\n\nEven if the arguments from risk of abuse and risk of breakdown of the\nrules of war do not hold in the case of coercing support and\nemployment of an expansive understanding of legitimate targets, this\ndoes not mean that revolutionaries are justified in deploying such\nirregular tactics. The principle of non-combatant immunity still seems\nto offer a compelling prima facie reason for holding such tactics to\nbe impermissible, and so some positive reason in support of their use\nmust be offered.\n\nIn defense of coercing support, Buchanan 2013 argues that some forms\nof coercion may be permissible, as when revolutionary fighters are\nconscripted through the threat of penalties such as expropriation of\nproperty or even perhaps confinement or lesser restrictions on\nliberty. The most plausible justification for such methods of coerced\nmobilization would characterize the goals of the revolution as public\ngoods of extraordinary moral importance and present coercion as a\nsolution to the collective action problem. For such coercion to be\njustified, it must be the case that the cause of revolution is just,\nthat the good gained by exercising coercion is proportionate to the\nbad of such coercion (i.e., one cannot use coercion to force persons\nto join a futile cause), the recruitment of further persons that can\nonly be achieved by coercion must be necessary for success, and the\nexercise of coercion must satisfy further standard principles\nconcerning the use of coercion to secure a morally significant public\ngood, namely the costs of coercion and contributing to the revolution\nmust be distributed fairly.\n\nWhat if anything can justify the deliberate targeting of\nnon-combatants by revolutionary forces? According to Fabre, \u201cthe\nact of killing an innocent person\u2014which infringes his right not\nto be killed and thereby extinguishes all his other\nrights\u2014cannot be justified unless as a way to avert the greater\nevil of far greater numbers of individuals suffering a similar loss,\nor a violation, of all rights. By implication, violations of the right\nto collective self-determination alone do not justify deliberately\ntargeting innocent non-combatants\u201d (Fabre 2012, p. 253).\n\nNotice that Fabre\u2019s conclusion takes for granted that\nnon-combatants are also innocent. In defense of a more expansive\nground for the deliberate targeting of non-combatants, Finlay argues\nthat some non-combatants are not innocent and that because of this\nfact it can be fair to distribute some of the harms of war to them.\nKey to Finlay\u2019s argument is the claim that there will be some,\nperhaps many, civilians whose conduct contributes to maintaining the\noppressive regime such that they are to some extent responsible for,\nor at least complicit in allowing, the harms of oppression to obtain.\nOn Finlay\u2019s view, then, supposing that targeting non-combatants\nis necessary for advancing a just revolutionary war and that doing so\nis the most proportionate means available, then targeting\nnon-combatants can be justified when the targets are to some extent\ncomplicit or responsible for oppression, which thereby grounds some\ndegree of liability to harm (Finlay 2015, pp. 261\u201383).\nComplications face this kind of argument as what counts as significant\ncontribution is both unclear and disputed. For example, a farmer who\nsupplies food for a tyranny\u2019s secret police or repairs the\nvehicles that they use to hunt down dissidents clearly makes a\ncontribution to their depredations, but it is unclear whether that\nsort of contribution makes her liable to deliberate targeting in war\n(Fabre 2009, Frowe 2014).\n",
