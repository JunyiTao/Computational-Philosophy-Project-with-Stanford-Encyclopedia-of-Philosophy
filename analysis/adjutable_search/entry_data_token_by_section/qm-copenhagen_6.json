Misunderstandings of Complementarity\n\nComplementarity has been commonly misunderstood in several ways, some\nof which shall be outlined in this section. First of all, earlier\ngenerations of philosophers and scientists have often accused\nBohr\u2019s interpretation of being positivistic or subjectivistic.\nToday philosophers have almost reached a consensus that it is neither.\nThere are, as many have noticed, both typically realist as well as\nantirealist elements involved in it, and it has affinities with Kant\nor neo-Kantianism. The influence of Kant or Kantian thinking on\nBohr\u2019s philosophy seems to have several sources. Some have\npointed to the tradition from Hermann von Helmholtz (Chevalley 1991,\n1994; Brock 2003); others have considered the Danish philosopher\nHarald H\u00f8ffding to be the missing link to Kantianism (Faye\n1991; and Christiansen 2006).\n\nBut because Bohr\u2019s view on complementarity has wrongly been\nassociated with positivism and subjectivism, much confusion still\nseems to stick to the Copenhagen interpretation. Don Howard (2004)\nargues, however, that what is commonly known as the Copenhagen\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics, regarded as representing a\nunitary Copenhagen point of view, differs significantly from\nBohr\u2019s complementarity interpretation. He holds that \u201cthe\nCopenhagen interpretation is an invention of the mid-1950s, for which\nHeisenberg is chiefly responsible, [and that] various other physicists\nand philosophers, including Bohm, Feyerabend, Hanson, and Popper,\nhav[e] further promoted the invention in the service of their own\nphilosophical agendas\u201d (p. 669).\n\nMore recently, Mara Beller (1999) argued that Bohr\u2019s statements\nare intelligible only if we presume that he was a radical\noperationalist or a simple-minded positivist. In fact, complementarity\nwas established as the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics in\nthe 1930s, a time when positivism was prevalent in philosophy of\nscience, and some commentators have taken the two to be closely\nassociated. During the 1930s Bohr was also in touch with some of the\nleading neopositivists or logical empiricists such as Otto Neurath,\nPhilip Frank, and the Danish philosopher J\u00f8rgen\nJ\u00f8rgensen. Although their anti-metaphysical approach to science\nmay have had some influence on Bohr (especially around 1935 during his\nfinal discussion with Einstein about the completeness of quantum\nmechanics), one must recall that Bohr always saw complementarity as a\nnecessary response to the indeterministic description of quantum\nmechanics due to the quantum of action. The quantum of action was an\nempirical discovery, not a consequence of a certain epistemological\ntheory, and Bohr thought that indeterminism was the price to pay to\navoid paradoxes. Never did Bohr appeal to a verificationist theory of\nmeaning; nor did he claim classical concepts to be operationally\ndefined. But it cannot be denied that some of the logical empiricists\nrightly or wrongly found support for their own philosophy in\nBohr\u2019s interpretation and that Bohr sometimes confirmed them in\ntheir impressions (Faye 2008).\n\nSecond, many physicists and philosophers see the reduction of the wave\nfunction as an important part of the Copenhagen interpretation. This\nmay be true for people like Heisenberg. But Bohr never talked about\nthe collapse of the wave packet. Nor did it make sense for him to do\nso because this would mean that one must understand the wave function\nas referring to something physically real. Only if one can interpret a\nquantum measurement as an interaction between an instrument and an\nobject, whose state is literally represented by\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s wave function, and therefore taken to contain\nall potential values of observation, does it make sense to claim that\nthe measurement forces the object to manifest one of these potential\nvales. Indeed, such a literal interpretation of the state vector\nimplies that these values are somehow intrinsically present in the\nobject with a certain probability all at once. In contrast, Bohr\nbelieved that particular kinematical and dynamical properties are\nrelational because their attribution to a quantum system makes sense\nonly in relation to a particular experimental set-up and therefore\nthat these numerical properties could have a specific value only\nduring a measurement.\n\nThird, Bohr flatly denied the ontological thesis that the subject has\nany direct impact on the outcome of a measurement. Hence, when he\noccasionally mentioned the subjective character of quantum phenomena\nand the difficulties of distinguishing the object from the subject in\nquantum mechanics, he did not think of it as a problem confined to the\nobservation of atoms alone. For instance, he stated that already\n\u201cthe theory of relativity reminds us of the subjective character\nof all physical phenomena\u201d (ATDN, p. 116). Rather, by\nreferring to the subjective character of quantum phenomena he was\nexpressing the epistemological thesis that all observations in physics\nare in fact context-dependent. There exists, according to Bohr, no\nview from nowhere in virtue of which quantum objects can be\ndescribed.\n\nFourth, although Bohr had spoken about \u201cdisturbing the phenomena\nby observation,\u201d in some of his earliest papers on\ncomplementarity, he never had in mind the observer-induced collapse of\nthe wave packet. Later he always talked about the interaction between\nthe object and the measurement apparatus which was taken to be\ncompletely objective. Thus, Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cat did not pose\nany riddle to Bohr. The cat would be dead or alive long before we open\nthe box to find out. What Bohr claimed was, however, that the state of\nthe object and the state of the instrument are dynamically inseparable\nduring the interaction. Moreover, the atomic object does not posses\nany state separate from the one it manifests at the end of the\ninteraction because the measuring instrument establishes the necessary\nconditions under which it makes sense to use the state concept.\n\nIt was the same analysis that Bohr applied in answering the challenge\nof the EPR-paper. Bohr\u2019s reply was that we cannot separate the\ndynamical and kinematical properties of a joint system of two\nparticles until we actually have made a measurement and thereby set\nthe experimental conditions for the ascription of a certain state\nvalue (CC, p. 80). Bohr\u2019s way of addressing the puzzle\nwas to point out that individual states of a pair of coupled particles\ncannot be considered in isolation, in the same way as the state of the\nobject and the state of the instrument are dynamically inseparable\nduring measurements. Thus, based on our knowledge of a particular\nstate value of the auxiliary body A, being an atomic object or an\ninstrument, we may then infer the state value of the object B with\nwhich A once interacted (Faye 1991, pp. 182\u2013183). It therefore\nmakes sense when Howard (2004, p.671) holds that Bohr considered the\npost-measurement joint state of the object and the measuring apparatus\nto be entangled as in any other quantum interaction involving an\nentangled pair.\n\nFinally, when Bohr insisted on the use of classical concepts for\nunderstanding quantum phenomena, he did not believe, as it is\nsometimes suggested, that macroscopic objects or the measuring\napparatus always have to be described in terms of the dynamical laws\nof classical physics. The use of the classical concepts is necessary,\naccording to Bohr, because by these we have learned to communicate to\nothers about our physical experience. The classical concepts are\nmerely a refinement of everyday concepts of position and action in\nspace and time. However, the use of the classical concepts is not the\nsame in quantum mechanics as in classical physics. Bohr was well aware\nof the fact that, on pains of inconsistency, the classical concepts\nmust be given \u201ca suitable quantum-theoretical\nre-interpretation,\u201d before they could be employed to describe\nquantum phenomena (ATDN, p. 8).\n",
