    "main_text": "What Is Full Moral Status (FMS)? || Stringent Presumption against Interference\n2.1 Stringent Presumption against Interference\n\nAll who employ the concept of FMS agree that, under most\ncircumstances, we are morally prohibited from interfering in various\nways with a being with FMS even for the sake of another valued\ncreature and its interests, or for the sake of any other value, such\nas art, justice, or world peace. For instance, we are prohibited from\nkilling a being with FMS for the sake of saving one or several other\nsuch beings. Some philosophers discuss this stringent presumption\nusing the terminology of duties and\n rights\n and focus mainly on the right not to be killed (e.g., Feinberg 1980,\npp. 98\u2013104).\n\nNote that FMS is not typically considered to preclude paternalistic\ninterference. A seven-year-old human being is typically granted FMS\n(as we will see below) but it is nevertheless permissible to treat her\npaternalistically in some respects (see the entry on\n paternalism).\n\nThe stringent moral presumption against interfering with a being with\nFMS, as it is typically understood, has at least these features:\n\nIt is an extremely strong moral reason against interfering,\nregardless of whether this interference results in harm. This\nextremely strong reason can be overridden only in a narrow set of\nspecial circumstances and might altogether silence many types of\nconflicting reasons. For example, while pleasure is a legitimate\nreason for action in numerous circumstances (e.g., when choosing a\nleisure activity), the fact that someone might receive pleasure from\nkilling a being with FMS is altogether removed from consideration as a\nreason for this action.\nDespite its strength, the presumption not to interfere with beings\nwith FMS may be overridden, perhaps, for example, when the lives of a\nvery large number of others are at stake. But, crucially, even when\nthe presumption is legitimately overridden in such special\ncircumstances a moral residue remains, so that, for example, there is\nstill reason to strongly regret the circumstances that called for such\naction.\nThe reason not to interfere with beings with FMS is stronger than\nthe reason not to similarly interfere with beings that have some, but\nnot full, moral status. For example, the reason not to kill a being\nwith FMS in medical experiments is much stronger than the reason (if\nthere is one) not to kill a similarly situated rabbit, which some\nconsider to have lesser moral status. (See section 3 below for further\ndiscussion.)\n\n\nAs noted earlier, those with FMS have equal moral status. This entails\nthat when two beings both have FMS, the reason not to interfere with\nthem is equally strong, all relevant factors held equal, and so one\nequally wrongs them when acting against these reasons, all relevant\nfactors held equal. This idea has been dubbed the \u201cequal\nwrongness thesis\u201d and it is open to various interpretations.\nMcMahan (2002, p. 235) focuses on the equal wrongness of killing\n(rather than the more general idea of the equal wrongness of acting\nagainst all the stringent protections that two beings with FMS merit).\nAccording to McMahan, a variety of factors are thought not to affect\nthe wrongness of killing of beings with FMS (and hence it does not\nmatter whether they are held equal), in cases when killing is wrong:\nthe being\u2019s age, level of intelligence, temperament, social\ncircumstances, etc. For example, for a young and an old person who\nboth have FMS, the reasons not to kill them are claimed to be equally\nstrong despite the fact that the young person stands to lose much more\nin dying than the old. This is consistent with holding (1) that other\nfactors, unrelated to the level of harm to the being, such as the mode\nof agency, defeaters, the number of people affected, and special\nrelationships, do make a difference to the degree of wrongness of\nkilling; and (2) that when killing is not wrong, as well as in the\ncontext of saving, factors related to harm (e.g., age, etc.) do make a\ndifference to what\u2019s best to do (McMahan 2002, pp. 236\u20137).\nMcMahan (2008) acknowledges that there are many challenges to the\nequal wrongness thesis. While the equal moral status of beings with\nFMS entails the equal wrongness of killing such beings when all\nrelevant factors are held equal, one can disagree about how best to\ninterpret it, i.e., which factors are or are not relevant to the\ndegree of wrongness of killing beings with FMS.\n",
