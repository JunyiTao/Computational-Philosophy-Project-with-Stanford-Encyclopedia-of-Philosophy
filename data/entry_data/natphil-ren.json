During the Renaissance,\ndespite the enduring centrality of the Aristotelian paradigm for the\ndiscipline, natural philosophy was enriched and expanded by a number\nof further approaches.

    "main_text": "\n1. Defining Renaissance Natural Philosophy\n\nRenaissance natural philosophy defies easy definition, since\ndescriptions of it may oversimplify, either by reducing it to its\nconnections with medieval science or, alternatively, forcing it into a\nteleology that culminates in the Scientific Revolution of the\nseventeenth century. Hence, there have been two opposing tendencies in\nscholarship: one which conflates the natural philosophy of the\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries with the variety practiced in the\nMiddle Ages, even going so far as to interpret the Renaissance as a\nperiod of conservatism in this regard; another which emphasizes the\nrole of Renaissance natural philosophy as a \u201cprecursor\u201d of\nmodern science, even at the cost of ignoring or removing its\nconnections to disciplines today considered pseudo-scientific, such as\nphysiognomy, astrology, and magic. Recent contributions, however, have\nhelped to outline the characteristics of Renaissance natural\nphilosophy in their own terms. Medieval natural philosophy was usually\nbased in the corpus aristotelicum and practiced in\nuniversities. Yet this did not mean that its approach was purely\nstatic or regressive; on the contrary, thinkers like Jean Buridan,\nBiagio Pelacani, and Nicole Oresme took Aristotelian physics and\nmechanics in new directions in medieval Europe. Nevertheless, the\nnature of medieval universities was such that teaching was heavily\ncontrolled by authorities, and especially outside of Italy both\nmetaphysics and theology exercised a strong influence. This imposed\nsome limitation to the directions in which scientific theorization\ncould advance. Paradoxically, it was the return of another, rival\nschool of thought\u2014Platonism\u2014that ultimately allowed for\nmore freedom within the Aristotelian tradition. Though Plato\u2019s\nphilosophy had never completely disappeared during the course of the\nMiddle Ages, the consolidation of a Neoplatonic school in the\nfifteenth century led to the clear distinctions between the spheres\nwhich properly belonged to the two great thinkers of the ancient\nworld. While Plato was regarded as a theologian and master of the\nmetaphysical realities, Aristotle was seen as an investigator of the\nsublunar world subject to generation and corruption. The recovery of\nthis ancient dichotomy had the effect of undermining the longstanding\nties between Aristotelianism and Scholasticism, and opened up new\nspaces for philosophy unimpaired by metaphysical limitations.\nMoreover, an open dialogue with the Platonic tradition, caused several\nprofessors to question Aristotle\u2019s coherence and reliability. At\nthe same time, also Platonism and other brands of ancient\nphilosophy\u2014Stoicism, Skepticism, and\nEpicureanism\u2014stimulated reflection on the natural world in\ndifferent ways, also in terms of method. The application of these\nideas to various fields of inquiry gave Renaissance natural thought a\ndistinctive identity, forged in continuous dialectic with\nAristotelianism itself. Aristotelianism therefore represented the\ndriving force behind Renaissance philosophy of nature, both because of\nits plurality of approaches and internal debates, and also because it\nserved as the polemical target of those who challenged the traditional\nparadigm of university teaching: both followers and adversaries of\nAristotle had constantly to negotiate with his authoritative legacy,\nand manipulate it. Finally, other factors of a non-speculative\ncharacter also had an impact on natural philosophy: technological\ninnovations such as printing, the telescope and the microscope,\ngeographical discoveries, and developments within the universities\nthemselves, such as the institution of botanical gardens.\n2. Natural Philosophy and the Curriculum\n2.1 Universities and Textbooks\n\nThe Aristotelian natural corpus covered a wide range of\nsubjects in a number of separate texts: while the Physics was\na sort of general work\u2014which appeared to some fifteenth- and\nsixteenth-century authors more metaphysical, even overlapping with the\nMetaphysics\u2014the other treatises represented different\nsections of natural philosophy on particulars. The success and\ninfluence of Aristotelian natural philosophy was due to its centrality\nto university teaching, where it was favored because it covered every\ntopic, like an encyclopedia. Few attempts were made to reconsider\nwhich texts represented the core of the study of natural philosophy in\nthe universities; one remarkable exception was Pierre de la\nRam\u00e9e (1515\u20131572), who put a distinctive emphasis on\nparticular sciences at the expense of study of the Physics.\nPhysics, along with On the Heavens, Meteorology, and\nOn Generation and Corruption, was the main reference for\nnatural philosophy in the traditional curricula of the\nFaculty of Arts. Universities\u2014especially in\nItaly\u2014appointed many lecturers in natural philosophy, who\nusually received high salaries. In the second half of the sixteenth\ncentury, separate chairs of botany, mathematics, and even chemistry\n(in Mantua and Germany), were established. Aristotelian texts were\ntraditionally studied according to the commentaries by Averroes (which\nprovided the internal partition of the texts into sections).\n\nBetween the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the works of other,\nmore ancient commentators on Aristotle were also adopted: those of\nAlexander of Aphrodisias and Simplicius were particularly popular, the\nfirst because of its radical mortalism, the second for its Neoplatonic\nand conciliatory tendencies. The rediscovery of the ancient\ncommentators was accompanied by an increasing reliance on the Greek\ntexts in universities, despite the enduring predominance of medieval\nLatin material. New commentaries also appeared alongside the ancient\nones: practically all of the most prominent professors composed their\nown commentaries to the Aristotelian natural texts, in particular\nbetween the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Usually these\ncommentaries followed the texts according to the Averroistic\ndivisions, but sometimes they were organized in\nquaestiones.\n\nFurthermore, the advent of printing made a large selection of\ntextbooks more widely available: some of them were very short\nintroductions for younger students, others were compendia,\nothers paraphrases (like those by Jacques Lef\u00e8vre\nd\u2019Etaples (1455\u20131536), printed for the first time in\n1492), and still others dialogues (again, Lef\u00e8vre\nd\u2019Etaples created some of the most significant examples). Other\npopular works used for teaching were abridged versions of the\nAristotelian treatises reduced to conclusiones, like the\npopular Textus abbreviatus philosophiae naturalis by the\nFrench theologian Thomas Bricot (d. 1516). There were also many\ndifferent textbooks, which generally followed canonical organizations:\neither they explained the Aristotelian works according to their order\nin the corpus, or they highlighted subjects like principles,\ncauses, movement, infinity, place, void, and time. The famous\nCommentarii Conimbricenses, which from 1594 on became the\nstandard text in the Jesuit curriculum, contains a whole\ncourse on natural philosophy organized as a commentary of the\nAristotelian corpus. Particularly after the second half of the\nsixteenth century, vernacular treatments of Aristotelian natural\nphilosophy also began to circulate, such as the translations by\nAntonio Brucioli (1498\u20131566), the paraphrases by Alessandro\nPiccolomini (1508\u20131579), the summaries by Jean de Champaignac\n(fl. 1595) and Scipion Dupleix (1569\u20131661), and the works by\nCesare Crivellati (1553\u20131640), the latter explicitly addressed\nto university students.\n2.2 Natural Philosophy\u2019s Rivalries and Interactions \n\nNatural philosophy interacted with many other disciplines. The close\nrelationship between natural philosophy and medicine had already been\nstressed by Aristotle himself at the beginning of On Sense and\nSensible (436a19\u2013436b2). Medicine often competed with\nnatural philosophy within the universities: philosophy was a\ncurricular requirement for those who wanted to study medicine in the\nItalian universities and many of the greatest Renaissance natural\nphilosophers were also physicians (e.g., Alessandro Achillini\n(1463\u20131512) and Simone Porzio (1496\u20131554); there were also\nprofessional physicians who wrote on natural philosophy, such as\nBalthassar Pisanellus (fl. 1559) and Daniel Furlanus (d. 1600)).\nUbi desinit philosophus (or physicus), incipit\nmedicus (\u201cwhere the philosopher ends, the physician\nbegins\u201d): so went a proverb which implied an ambiguous boundary\nbetween the two disciplines: on the one hand, it reflected the need to\nmove beyond the theory represented by philosophy and into the actual\npractice of medicine; on the other, it affirmed the idea that natural\nphilosophy was necessary in order to prepare for medical studies. From\nthis perspective, natural philosophy represented either a mere\npreparatory stage on the way to the more perfect and concrete\nknowledge of medicine, or, alternatively, medicine was subordinate to\nnatural philosophy (others, like the philosopher Jacopo Zabarella\n(1533\u20131589), preferred to distinguish natural philosophy from\nmedicine because these two disciplines did not share subject and\nmethod).\n\nThe Renaissance debate over the superiority of Aristotle or Galen was\npart of this rivalry: Aristotle was regarded by physicians as an\nimportant authority because of his philosophical system, but Galen had\noffered in his works more precise observations of the human body.\nNonetheless, since many points of their disagreement (e.g., the\nlocalization of the brain functions) were merely founded on\nspeculation, some doctors preferred to demonstrate the harmony between\nAristotle and Galen in order to overcome this impasse.\n\nAnother discipline often compared to natural philosophy was astrology.\nThe Jesuit Benito Pereira (1536\u20131610) stated that natural\nphilosophy is different from astrology because, among other reasons,\nthe former studies things a priori, the latter a\nposteriori. Pereira also claimed that natural philosophy was not\ncapable of delineating its own sphere of inquiry, something which was\npossible for other disciplines such as logic and metaphysics.\n\nUniversity courses on the Physics traditionally began with a\nlecture on ethical themes. This arrangement was inspired by\nAverroes\u2019 proem to the text, which argued for the moral\nperfection of the speculative man. The connection between ethics and\nnatural philosophy also appeared in discussions of subjects like the\nimmortality of the soul or the human will, and consequently ethical\ndiscussions could occupy large sections both in reportationes\nof lessons and commentaries.\n3. Revising the Curriculum: Academies, Philology, and Botanical Gardens\n\nOutside of universities and schools, there were also other places\nwhere natural philosophy was cultivated, particularly in academies and\nlearned societies. Even in literary societies such as the\nAccademia Fiorentina (1541), patronized by Duke Cosimo\nde\u2019Medici and his descendants, scientific matters (e.g., alchemy\nor spontaneous generation) were occasionally debated, often in the\ncontext of commentaries on the poems of Dante and Petrarch. The\nAccademia dei Lincei, founded in 1603, on the other hand, was\nexclusively interested in the sciences: as their statute dictated, the\nLincei had no interest in any controversy which was not\nscientific or mathematical, and they avoided involvement in political\nmatters. The Accademia dei Lincei, like the Accademia del\nCimento after it (1657), was founded and patronized by members of\nthe aristocracy, but never became as well-grounded as other learned\nsocieties, such as the Royal Society (1661) or the Acad\u00e9mie\nRoyale (1666), which were directly sponsored by the state (the\nAcad\u00e9mie Royale even received financial support from\nthe treasury). Both of these latter institutions developed out of more\ninformal associations and they encouraged collaboration among their\nmembers; they also explicitly endorsed the open and public exchange of\nideas, as opposed to the secretive practices of groups like the\nLincei. Their members gave public demonstrations of their\nwork, and the secrecy which had characterized scientific pursuit for\ncenturies was eventually abandoned in favor of a new empirical\napproach.\n\nNonetheless, even when they did not sponsor academies, Renaissance\nlords and patrons often had a particular interest in scientific works\nand treatises, especially those devoted to subjects of military value\n(such as the works on metalworking by Vannoccio Biringuccio and George\nAgricola, or Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia\u2019s treatise on ballistics,\nin the mid-sixteenth century), or booklets dedicated to parva\nnaturalia, which were intended as forms of intellectual\nentertainment and usually contained descriptions of miranda\nnaturae or astrological predictions. Exceptional natural events\nsuch as earthquakes\u2014a famous one occurred in Pozzuoli in\n1537\u2014led to the publication of a number of short treatises that\ninterpreted the calamity as either a natural phenomenon or as a sign\nsent by the celestial influences: these works were particularly sought\nafter by powerful men, who wanted to be reassured about the\nsignificance of natural events and their possible consequences.\nSeveral Renaissance rulers cultivated an interest in sciences like\nalchemy, and patronized or participated first-hand in investigations\nof the natural world: disciplines like zoology, which depended on the\ncollection of material, information, and drawings, relied particularly\nheavily on the sponsorship of the wealthy and powerful. The zoological\nand botanical works and catalogues which, though composed by\nuniversity professors, started from the 1540s to circulate around\nEurope, were often addressed to or sponsored by rulers, who had the\nmeans to employ artists and other specialists needed to complete these\ncostly volumes. Drawings were not simply ornaments to a text, but a\nnecessity for accurate classification of plants and animals.\n\nThe same desire for accuracy that motivated the production of\nscientific images also led to more rigorous editions and translations\nof classic scientific texts, whose impact was magnified by the\nprinting press. Between 1495 and 1498 Aldus Manutius printed the\n\u201cGreek Aristotle\u201d in Venice, an edition prepared by a team\nwhich included the humanist-physicians Niccol\u00f2 Leoniceno and\nThomas Linacre under the guidance of another physician, Francesco\nCavalli. Consequently, Manutius\u2019s edition, which incorporated\nsignificant improvements of the Aristotelian texts such as those\nproposed years before by Theodor Gaza for the Historia\nAnimalium, favored the scientific works by Aristotle and did not\ninclude, for example, either Rhetoric or Poetics.\nYet the scientific text that received the most attention from\nphilologists was Pliny\u2019s Natural History. Between the\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries Pliny\u2019s work was emended by\nphilologists such as Ermolao Barbaro, Angelo Poliziano, and\nNiccol\u00f2 Leoniceno\u2014and also translated several times in\nthe vernaculars\u2014in increasingly sophisticated versions. Both the\neditions and the translations were intended to allow for a correct\nunderstanding of the text, which was often used by doctors and\napothecaries. The same thing happened with Dioscorides\u2019\nMateria medica, a text that unlike the encyclopedic\nNatural History was plainly addressed to a medical audience,\nand which was then repeatedly emended and translated by professional\nphysicians and natural philosophers. Yet, also authors like Virgil,\nHorace and Ovid were common presences in discussions about botany, and\neven a philological evaluation of the text of the Bible could\nprovide material to natural philosophers.\n\nThe foundation of botanical gardens in Pisa, Padua, and Florence\n(1544\u20131545), and then in Bologna, Leiden, Oxford, Montpellier,\nand Germany testify to the fact that empirical knowledge was\nincreasingly considered a necessity even in the universities, despite\nthe fact that even at the end of the sixteenth century chairs in\nbotany, such as the one occupied by Andrea Cesalpino (1519\u20131603)\nin Pisa, came with lower salaries than the ones given to their\n\u201cspeculative colleagues\u201d who taught natural philosophy or\nmedicine. The aforementioned catalogues of animals and plants, like\nthose published by Pierre Belon (1517\u20131564), Guillaume Rondelet\n(1507\u20131566), and Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522\u20131605), were thus\na combination of received authority and empirical observation, based\non 1) a philological and critical knowledge of the classical texts,\nnot a passive reading of them; and 2) direct observations and\nconversations not only with erudite peers and colleagues, but also\nwith the so-called \u201cinvisible\ntechnicians\u201d\u2014fishermen, sailors, and peasants who had\nfirst-hand knowledge of the relevant subjects and provided scientists\nwith important pieces of information. Not by chance, in a\nlittle-explored field like the study of minerals, the most significant\ncontributions came from self-described \u201cmen without\nletters\u201d (meaning not Latinate), such as Leonardo da Vinci\n(1452\u20131519) and the potter Bernard Palissy (1510\u20131589),\nwho identified fossils as the result of organic processes rather than\nabstract virtues.\n\nThese empirical approaches were also stimulated by the European\ndiscovery of the Americas and other continents, which contained plants\nand animals never known or never described by classical authorities\nlike Aristotle and Pliny. The new knowledge brought by travelers and\nexplorers helped debunk erroneous doctrines advocated by Aristotle,\nsuch as the uninhabitability of the torrid zone from\nMeteorology 362b 6\u20139: a major exponent of Renaissance\nAristotelianism, Pietro Pomponazzi (1462\u20131525), publicly mocked\nthe Philosopher during his classes when discussing this passage, and\nsupported his position by referring to the direct, recent observations\nof the navigator Antonio Pigafetta.\n\nThe shift from a text-based approach to the study of nature founded on\nthe study of a limited number of authors, to a new one based on an\nenlarged encyclopedia and, above all, direct observation, reached its\nfull expression at the time of Galileo Galilei; but it was already\nperceptible in the writings of Lorenzo Valla (circa\n1406\u20131457)\u2014who appealed to common sense against the\nabsurdity of some of the Aristotelian tenets\u2014and in those of\nLeonardo da Vinci, who invoked a virtuous interaction between science\nand practice. When Tommaso Campanella (1568\u20131639) stated that he\nlearned more from the anatomy of an ant or an herb than from any book\never written, he was simply expressing in a beautiful and poetic form\na shared methodological creed.\n4. Aristotelian Tenets, Platonic Tenets, and More\n\nThe principal tenets of the Aristotelian natural philosophy were: the\ndoctrine of form and matter, the four causes, the rigid separation of\nthe world into opposed spheres, and the finite nature of the universe.\nDuring the Renaissance, these precepts were both defended and revised\nby Aristotelian professors, or challenged by others who sought to\ndismantle traditional philosophy. While these new philosophers could\nrely on new evidence, methods, and observations to define the nature\nof the universe, in other cases the rejection of Aristotelian\ndoctrines and their substitution with new paradigms was mainly based\non speculative arguments. \n4.1 Principles and Matter\n4.1.1 Principles\n\nAccording to Aristotle, if the sublunar world was characterized by\nmutability, the supralunar world was\u2014on the\ncontrary\u2014absolutely immutable. The fundamental principles of\nAristotelian physics were in fact matter, form, and privation, and the\nnatural sublunar world was therefore the location where according to\nthese principles generation and corruption took place. Independent\nphilosophers offered alternatives to these principles and to the\nAristotelian hylemorphic apparatus. In order to describe nature within\nits own limits, Bernardino Telesio (1509\u20131588)\u2014a staunch\nopponent of Aristotelianism\u2014defended a different set of\nprinciples which had already been proposed by authors such Girolamo\nCardano (1501\u20131576) and Girolamo Fracastoro (circa\n1476\u20131553), and which he argued was based on data gathered from\nexperience rather than on arbitrary constructions. These alternative\nprinciples were passive matter and active force, the latter\ndistinguished into heat and cold. It was the interplay\u2014or\nrather, the battle\u2014between these opposite forces that brought\nabout the natural world. Since every natural being depends on the\ninteraction between cold and heat, it must know what is necessary for\nits survival: therefore everything, including the forces themselves,\npossesses sensation, which was not related to the faculties of the\nsoul, as in Aristotelian psychology. This connection between\nsensus and self-preservation was also advocated by Tommaso\nCampanella, who emphasized its importance for natural magic.\nTelesio\u2019s polemical refusal of Aristotle and his call for\nphysical inquiry made within natural limits was appreciated and\npraised even by those who recognized the contradictions in his\ntheories. Francesco Patrizi (1529\u20131597), who attacked Aristotle\nfrom a Platonic perspective in his Nova de Universis\nPhilosophia (1591), rebuked Telesio for the latter\u2019s claim\nto have relied exclusively on the senses and rejected reason: he\npointed out that, in reality, Telesio did rely on metaphysical\narguments, though he claimed to deny them (for his part, Patrizi\nbelieved that natural philosophy requires metaphysical tools to fill\nin its gaps). The same recognition of too much reliance on metaphysics\ndrove Francis Bacon (1561\u20131626) to reject Telesio\u2019s views\nin favor of experimental empiricism and of a full endorsement of the\ntestimony of sensory perception.\n4.1.2 The Nature of Matter\n\nMost Aristotelian interpreters believed matter to be prope\nnihil, pure potentiality, while others believed that it possessed\na certain degree of reality and actuality. The discussion on the\nnature of matter was further complicated by the suggestions offered by\nother traditions of thought, Platonism above all. According to\nMarsilio Ficino (1433\u20131499) in his Platonic Theology,\nprime matter had an existence which is not dependent upon form.\nClosely following the Timaeus, he claimed that matter can\ntherefore be intelligible, though in a weaker way. Giordano Bruno\n(1548\u20131600) proposed an even more radical departure from\ntraditional views of the passivity of matter. In the De la causa,\nprincipio et uno, Bruno affirmed that matter is an active\nprinciple, not passive. Matter contains within itself every form, both\ncorporeal and incorporeal, and can be described as a kind of infinite\nlife. Bruno\u2019s conception of matter also served as the basis for\nhis cosmological views (see below), and in particular for his claim\nthat the universe is infinite. A few years later, Tommaso Campanella\nreturned to a more traditional position. In the Del senso delle\ncose e della magia (printed in 1620) he argued for the synonymity\nbetween matter and body, and against the identification of matter with\nthe Aristotelian prope nihil, though he did emphasize its\npassivity: matter receives forms from external agents and does not\nproduce them from within itself.\n\nClosely related to these problems was Aristotle\u2019s doctrine of\nprime matter, which had controversial implications: as matter was\neternal, so was the world, and therefore the Christian dogma of the\ncreation of the world was untenable. Scholastic philosophers had long\nstruggled with this subject during the Middle Ages, and the most\ninteresting developments during the Renaissance were driven by the\nconfrontation between Aristotelianism and Platonism. Plato, in the\nTimaeus, had clearly spoken of a God-creator, and once again\nhis doctrines were adopted by authors anxious to establish a new\nphilosophical foundation for Christianity. Bessarion (d. 1472), for\nexample, admitted that according to Plato matter was eternal, but that\nhe distinguished it clearly from the creator, who possesses a superior\neternity. In similar fashion, Marsilio Ficino expressly described\nprime matter as created and therefore not subject to generation and\ncorruption. Aristotelians were not always afraid, however, to argue\nfor the eternity of the prime matter: Francesco Vimercato\n(1512\u20131569), in his posthumous De rerum principiis, is\nthe most remarkable example. As late as the beginning of the\nseventeenth century, the debate continued: Cesare Crivellati composed\na dialogue (1617) between Plato and Aristotle in which the master\nrebukes his unfaithful student for teaching such an impious doctrine.\nOn the other hand, there were also authors who attempted to establish\nan accord between Plato and Aristotle on this sensitive issue: a good\nexample is the De naturae philosophia seu de Platonis et\nAristotelis consensione (1554) by Sebastian Fox Morcillo\n(1526\u20131560), in which the Spanish philosopher compares the\ndoctrines of the Timaeus and the Physics, and\nemphasizes the limits of both in front of the perfection of\nreligion.\n\nOther thinkers instead had a pragmatic approach to prime matter:\nalchemists like the Swiss physician Paracelsus (1493\u20131541)\nsought to find a principle to which every substance could be reduced.\nThough openly challenging traditional university teaching, Paracelsus\ndid not reject canonical motifs. For example, he relied on the four\nelements (air, fire, water, earth), but he also proposed a new triad:\nsulfur, mercury, and salt. Yet, even this proposal was not as\niconoclastic as it appears, since it was partially founded on the\nAristotelian doctrine of the formation of metals contained in the\nMeteorology (341b 6ff.). Nonetheless, by emphasizing the\nprocesses of association and dissociation of substances, Paracelsus\noffered an important contribution to the transformation of alchemy\ninto chemistry (even if the two terms were often intended as\ninterchangeable). Gradually chemistry separated from physics,\nunderstood as the science of bodies subject to movement, and\npositioned itself as the science of bodies associated and dissociated.\nJohann Baptist Van Helmont (1579\u20131644), who opposed the\nParacelsian principles, developed a corpuscular doctrine of matter, a\nvariant of atomistic theory. Atomism in the Renaissance was typically\nrelated to the Neoplatonic concept of semina and to the\nEpicurean philosophy, and was usually advocated by radical\nanti-Aristotelian thinkers like Giordano Bruno. And while it is true\nthat Aristotle rejected atomism and the existence of the void, there\nwere ways to argue for a Peripatetic version of atomism.\n\n\n\n\nSome medieval philosophers admitted the existence of minima\nnaturalia, the limits beyond which form is not conserved. The\ndoctrine of the minima was intended to resolve a problem\nraised by Aristotle in On Generation and Corruption (327a\n30\u2013328b 24), namely, that of the necessity of finding a\nphilosophical justification for combination, an intermediate\nphenomenon between generation and corruption. Over the course of the\nRenaissance the doctrine of minima naturalia was further\nelaborated by authors like Agostino Nifo (circa 1469\u2013circa 1539)\nand Julius Caesar Scaliger (1484\u20131558). Scaliger granted a\nconsistency to the minima, making them not mere limits, but\nreal physical components that cannot be further divided. Furthermore,\nhe rejected traditional atomism, because it did not achieve the\ncontinuity of the corpuscles which constitute a body. Despite their\nopposition to Peripateticism, the corpuscularism of Van Helmont and\nDaniel Sennert (1572\u20131637) was rooted in this tradition.\nSennert, in particular, was unable to reject the Aristotelian concept\nof form, and aimed instead to establish a concord between\nAristotelianism and atomism. Even in a work programmatically entitled\nPhilosophia Naturalis adversus Aristotelem (1621), Sebastian\nBasson\u2014who defended corpuscularism\u2014denied the existence of\nthe void and rejected a mechanization of the natural world. It was\nGalileo Galilei who made a bold departure from the qualitative\nbackground of Aristotelian matter, defending a mechanistic form of\natomism in which atoms did not have dimensions. Despite the attempts\nof Pierre Gassendi (1592\u20131655) to conciliate it with\nChristianity, atomism bothered traditionalists also for its\ntheological implications, both large (the teleological vision of the\nworld) and small (transubstantiation). Even Ren\u00e9 Descartes\n(1596\u20131650) came under attack for this reason. Debate over the\nexistence of the void was also lively throughout the seventeenth\ncentury, largely because of the experimental work of Evangelista\nTorricelli (1608\u20131647), Valeriano Magni (1586\u20131661), Otto\nVon Guericke (1602\u20131686), and Robert Boyle (1627\u20131691),\nwho opposed the traditional views of the so-called\n\u201cplenists\u201d. \n4.2 Old Cosmologies, New Cosmologies\n\nThe rigid peripatetic division of the universe into two different\nparts\u2014one immutable and made of crystalline spheres, situated\nbetween the fixed stars and the moon, the other mutable, under the\nmoon\u2014was also related in the Aristotelian paradigm to the\nconcept of the natural sublunar world formed by the four elements:\nfire, air, water, and earth. Every element behaves differently,\naccording to its so-called \u201cnatural movement\u201d. Light\nelements, such as fire and air, always tend to go upward, while heavy\nelements, such as water and earth, move downward following a\nrectilinear movement. Every element aims, in fact, to reach its own\nnatural place, unless an external force causes a movement opposite to\nits nature\u2014a \u201cviolent movement\u201d (e.g., a stone\nthrown into the air). In both cases, Aristotelian theory considers\nmovement as a quality common to all natural things because of the\nelements which compose them. By contrast, the heavens, since perfect\nand composed by a single element (aether), are immutable and travel in\nconstant circular motion around an immovable center represented by\nEarth. An important corollary to the theory of natural places was the\nfinite character of the world, because it implied the existence of a\nunique center (the Earth), while evidently it would not be possible\nfor an infinite universe to have a center.\n\nThese longstanding paradigms were destined to be challenged from the\nsixteenth century onward, both from a speculative and an empirical\nperspective. Observation of stellae novae and comets\ncondemned the crystalline spheres and raised doubts regarding the\ndoctrine of the immutability of heavens. According to the traditional\nAristotelian account, comets were phenomena in the sublunar\natmosphere. The great astronomer Johannes Regiomontanus\n(1436\u20131476) did not challenge this vision of the cosmos when he\ncalculated the distance of the 1472 comet by considering the angle of\nparallax, but about a century later, the Jesuit Christopher Clavius\n(1538\u20131612), observing a nova (1572), and Tycho Brahe\n(1546\u20131601), observing a comet (1577), both demonstrated that\nthe suddenly bright star and the comet must lie beyond the moon, and\nthat therefore the doctrine of the spheres was false. The demonstrated\nfluidity of heavens also compromised, more crucially, the doctrine of\ntheir immutability. Two factors made possible such an achievement: the\navailability of better measuring instruments, and a stronger emphasis\non mathematics. This emphasis on mathematics was probably the most\nimportant contribution of Platonism to the development of natural\nphilosophy, and in particular astronomy, during the Renaissance.\nThough it is true that Neoplatonic philosophers had proposed\nalternatives to the Peripatetic theories on the heavens (e.g.,\nMarsilio Ficino argued that the heavens were made of spiritus\nand rejected the division of the universe into spheres), it was their\ninsistence on the importance of geometry and mathematics that helped\nopening the way to the quantitative vision of the world, which\ngradually replaced the qualitative paradigm connected to the\nAristotelian tradition.\n\nThe decision of Nicolaus Copernicus (1473\u20131543) to propose a\nheliocentric system, remove the Earth from the center of the universe,\nand establish a relationship between the distances of the different\nplanets from the sun and the amplitude of their orbits was based on\nmathematical reasoning and the weaknesses of Aristotelian-Ptolemaic\nsystem in this regard. Johannes Kepler (1571\u20131630) defended the\nCopernican theory by re-utilizing geometrical arguments from\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus, and he also developed other theories\n(such as the elliptical form of the planetary orbits) founded on the\ngeometrical structure that he attributed to the universe. Despite the\nfact that aspects of his method, and in particular the\nregressus, were essentially Aristotelian, Galileo Galilei\n(1564\u20131642) has been often described as a Platonist, insofar as\nPlatonism endorsed a mathematical approach. Galileo denied the reality\nof the physical elements of the Aristotelian world and the theory of\ntheir natural movements, and replaced them with corporeal matter,\nwhose properties and motions could be described in mathematical terms.\nFurthermore, by relying on new instruments such as the telescope,\nGalileo was also able to make new observations which revealed the\nimperfections of the supralunar world. Galileo and the Copernican\ntheory met with the resistance of the Church, but also of the\nuniversities, whose professoriate was not eager to renounce one of the\ncentral pillars of its teaching. On the other hand, the Tychonic\nsystem elaborated by Brahe, which attempted to conciliate the\ntraditional Aristotelian-Ptolemaic cosmology with Copernicus,\nencountered support even among Jesuit scientists.\n\nHowever, neither mathematics nor fresh observations were capable of\nresolving the problem of the nature of the universe: was it finite or\ninfinite? Is there only one world or do multiple worlds exist?\nAccording to the Aristotelians the universe must be finite, because it\nis impossible to have an infinite body in act, and Copernicus and his\nfollowers also endorsed the finitude of the heavens. Theology,\nhowever, offered arguments against the finitude of the universe:\nNicholas of Cusa (1401\u20131464) connected the infinity of God to\nthe infinity of heavens, and Palingenio Stellato (or Pierangelo\nManzolli, 1500/3\u20131543 ca.), in his Zodiacus Vitae,\ncompiled themes from different traditions (e.g., the Aristotelian\nspheres and the Platonic ideas), describing a universe made of\ninfinite light in order to celebrate the glory of God. Francisco\nSuarez (1548\u20131617), and a few years later the\nConimbricenses, also defended the existence of an infinite\nspace, even if it was only an imaginary one, combining Peripatetic\ndoctrines with theological ones (above all the omnipresence of God,\nwhich cannot be limited by a finite space). Giordano Bruno used the\nrelationship between God and His creation to argue for the infinity of\nthe world. Bruno\u2019s position was in complete opposition to the\nAristotelian cosmology: the spheres are broken, there is no hierarchy\nbetween the different parts of the world and no center, and therefore\nthe natural movements are rejected. Bruno developed his theory of\ninfinity not only by relying on metaphysical arguments, but also on a\nradical revision of the Aristotelian definition of space, which he\nunderstood as a continuous quantity. Bruno\u2019s proposal provoked\nreactions all over Europe: Kepler rejected it several times in\ndifferent ways. Nevertheless, Kepler agreed with Bruno\u2019s belief\nin the plurality of worlds\u2014a problem which raised theological\nissues because of the question of salvation. Tommaso\nCampanella\u2014an author who denied the infinity of the\nuniverse\u2014resolved it by arguing that the inhabitants of the\nother worlds were not men, and therefore did not need to be saved by\nGod.\n4.3 Miracles, Magic, and Physiognomy\n\nIn the Middle Ages authors like Pietro of Abano, Nicolas Oresme, and\nJohn Buridan argued that any phenomenon, in particular those which\nwere usually believed to be supernatural or miraculous, could be\nexplained according to natural principles as the result of hidden\ncauses. A number of Renaissance thinkers also adopted this approach,\nincluding Pietro Pomponazzi. In his De incantationibus,\nPomponazzi stated that men tend to consider phenomena wondrous when\nthey are not able to identify their causes as the work of demons or\nmiracles. Pomponazzi attributed apparently miraculous events to the\npower of imagination, to psychological states or to the influence of\nthe stars, since according to the Peripatetic paradigm the immutable\nfirst mover cannot have direct contact with the mutable sublunar\nworld, and therefore moves through secondary causes. Nonetheless,\ndespite his claim to speak purely secundum Aristotelem,\nPomponazzi relied on a wider range of readings, including Marsilio\nFicino. And in making these claims, Pomponazzi encroaches on very\nsensitive questions of religious faith. In his view, Christian\nmiracles can be understood in the context of a sort of philosophy of\nhistory, founded on the horoscope of religions: when a religion\nbegins, miracles occur, which are caused by starry influences, and\nwhen a religion declines, miracles disappear, because starry\ninfluences are weaker. This paradigm involved a rigid organization of\nthe universe, which left little or no space for free will. Pomponazzi\ntook this doctrine to its logical extreme in his De fato, a\nwork in which he claimed to endorse Stoicism, while in reality\nexposing the determinism embedded in the Aristotelian doctrine of\ncauses. Other Aristotelians who sought to avoid this determinism\nusually relied on the moderate position of Alexander of Aphrodisias,\nwho Pomponazzi attacked in the first part of his treatise. While\nPomponazzi reached these conclusions drawing on multiple sources,\nother authors, such as Gerardus Bucoldianus, Simone Porzio, and\nLudovico Boccadiferro preferred to rely solely on Aristotle in order\nto explain wondrous events like cataclysms or the appearance of\nmonstrous creatures, like those described by Ulisse Aldrovandi\n(1522\u20131605), who interpreted them as deviations from the course\nof nature, or Fortunio Liceti (1577\u20131657), who preferred to link\nthe appearance of monsters to ingenious experiments of nature.\n\nNevertheless, this approach, which reduced the supernatural to the\nnatural, was not always coupled with Aristotelianism. On the contrary,\nit was often directed against Peripatetic doctrines, particularly when\nit relied on experimental and empirical observations. The search for\nthe occult causes of things, which was often related to magical\nbeliefs and practices, effectively stimulated new empirical\napproaches: Giovanbattista della Porta (1535\u20131615) was among\nthose who offered natural explanations for exceptional events while\ndiscarding the Aristotelian paradigm in favor of direct experience, in\nworks such as the Magiae naturalis sive de miraculis rerum\nnaturalium. Della Porta insisted on the sympathy and the\nantipathy of things, which are influenced by celestial virtues, when\ndealing with topics like optics and magnetism. And the De\nmagnete of the anti-Aristotelian William Gilbert\n(1544\u20131603) mixed experimentation (aimed at the demonstration of\nthe rotation and the magnetism of earth) with the belief in the\nexistence of a soul belonging to the earth. The occult properties of\nthings were also explored by other disciplines, such as medicine. Jean\nFernel (1497\u20131558) and Girolamo Fracastoro argued that occult\nproperties could be used to explain diseases and contagions.\n\nThe knowledge of the secrets of nature was in fact central to magic, a\nfield which had an ambiguous relationship to natural philosophy. If a\nnatural philosopher wanted to describe and understand nature, a\npractitioner of magic wanted to investigate it and its occult\nproperties in order to master it. The Neoplatonic correspondences\nbetween macrocosmus\u2014the world\u2014and\nmicrocosmus\u2014man\u2014allow magic to exercise its power\non a reality which was seen in vitalistic and transcendental terms:\nthe book of nature for practitioners of magic was not the same one as\nthat of the Aristotelians or of Galileo, but it was written with signs\nand allusions. Magical doctrines had a wide circulation throughout the\nMiddle Ages, but were enriched in the fifteenth century by the\nrediscovery of the Corpus Hermeticum. The Corpus was\na collection of heterogeneous texts, dealing both with practical magic\nand the mystical teachings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, an\nEgyptian sage who purportedly lived at the time of Moses and was first\nin the lineage of a tradition of wisdom (the so-called prisca\ntheologia). The alleged antiquity of the Corpus\nrepresented the strongest evidence of its authority and reliability,\nand thinkers like Marsilio Ficino in his De vita, and then\nCornelius Agrippa (1486\u20131535) in his De occulta\nphilosophia, proposed doctrines based on it. Their readers were\nencouraged to carve talismans and images, and surround themselves with\nprecise colors or herbs connected to planetary influences in order to\nexploit the conjunction of the whole, a living being of which man is\nboth part and lord. Magical treatises included recipes and empirical\ndescriptions, and in his De augmentis Scientiarum even\nFrancis Bacon described magic as an operative knowledge of hidden\nforms and the harmony of things, which displays the wonderful works of\nnature. The connection between micro and macrocosmus\nalso underlay medical practice\u2014as in the case of Ficino himself\nand later Paracelsus\u2014and disciplines like physiognomy, which was\nconsidered part of the Aristotelian natural encyclopedia. Della\nPorta\u2019s De physiognomia humana (1586), which was mainly\na collection of past authorities that included ethical problems and\nwas accompanied by illustrations, became the standard text on the\ntopic until Lavater. There were also expressly hermetic approaches to\nthe subject, including the one by Robert Fludd (1574\u20131637).\n4.4 Natural Philosophy and Religion\n\nMany of the doctrines of natural philosophy contrasted with the\nteachings of religion, and there were a number of possible solutions\nto this problem. Some authors appealed to the radical difference\nbetween the realms of faith and philosophy, relying on the Averroistic\n(even if not formulated by Averroes himself) doctrine of the\n\u201cdouble truth\u201d. This was the case, for example, of Pietro\nPomponazzi. Yet other authors, such as Bessarion or Simone Porzio, who\ncame from very different backgrounds, rejected any confusion between\nphilosophy and faith at the latter\u2019s expense (even though\nBessarion, like Ficino, argued for a greater compatibility between\nPlatonism and Christianity). There were also others, like the Jesuit\nPedro da Fonseca (1528\u20131599), who considered Plato\u2019s\nnatural philosophy too dangerously similar to Christianity and\ntherefore preferred the Aristotelian paradigm. On the other hand, some\nthinkers tried instead to genuinely reconcile philosophy and faith,\nparticularly during the periods of doctrinal conflict and religious\nwarfare that followed the Reformation. This was particularly true in\nProtestant countries, where even at the end of the sixteenth century\nthe problem of the double truth was a matter of intense debate.\nReformed scholars displayed a clear bias against Aristotle, the\nphilosopher who they held responsible for sustaining the scholastic\nedifice of Catholic theology, and in Wittenberg they even mounted a\nshort-lived attempt to replace him with Pliny: but the disordered\napproach of the Natural History made it unsuitable for\nsuperseding the Aristotelian encyclopedia for teaching. Philipp\nMelanchthon (1497\u20131560) reconciled the distinction between\nreligion and science of nature by arguing that nature was creation of\nGod and everything in it had to be seen as the work of providence.\nSome philosophers, such as John Amos Comenius (1592\u20131670),\nsupported the alliance between natural science and religion by arguing\nfor a philosophy based on the biblical teachings, even though this\nposition was often intended to combat the excess of natural\nphilosophers rather than to offer an alternative system. However, both\nin Protestant and Catholic contexts, scientists like Rheticus\n(1514\u20131574) and Galileo denied that the Bible had any scientific\nvalue (yet, refusing tout court the divine role in the\nexplanation of Biblical events such as the Genesis flood, in favor a\nof a fully natural account, as Camilla Erculiani suggested in 1584,\nwas likely to cause the intervention of the Roman Inquisition).\nScholars like John Case (d. 1600), who considered Aristotelianism\ncompatible with Christian dogmas such as creation and divine\nprovidence, were particularly fond of searching for ways to syncretize\ntheology with natural philosophy. Attempts to reconcile the\nPhilosopher with the Christian religion, even at the cost of relying\non forced or fanciful readings, were still being made in the\nseventeenth century. Descartes will solve the interferences between\nnatural science and religion by limiting the former to the\ninvestigation of finite objects, the only ones accessible to human\nbeings. Yet, by posing limits to human knowledge, he also rejected an\nanthropocentric view of the creation.\n\nNor were these problems confined to Christian learned contexts: they\nwere the subject of a number of similar reflections within the Jewish\ntradition as well. Jewish thinkers often considered natural science a\nmere system of hypotheses, which was capable of grasping only the\nsuperficial appearance of things, and was subordinate to the absolute\ntruth offered by the Torah. This position was defended by authors such\nas Judah Loew ben Bezalel (also known as Maharal, 1520\u20131609),\nwho posited a radical distinction between the natural world and the\nteachings of Torah, as well as Azariah Figo (1579\u20131547). In\nparticular, Loew claimed that while it was possible to illuminate and\nexplain the natural order of the physical world, this was not true of\nthe relationship between God and the creation. This attitude was\nprobably in part due to Jews\u2019 sense of exclusion and\nmarginalization from the institutions where natural philosophy was\ntaught and practiced (an important exception to this rule was Italy,\nwhere personalities like Elijah del Medigo (circa 1458\u20131493)\ntook advantage of the separation between science and theology in the\nuniversities). Nonetheless, all of these Jewish authors\u2014both the\nItalian \u201cfree-thinkers\u201d and those who defended the\nsuperiority of the Torah\u2014still relied on Aristotle as the main\nauthority for natural philosophy, and there were multiple attempts by\nphilosophers like Ioseph ben Shem Tov (circa 1400\u2013circa 1480)\nand Abraham Farissol (1451\u2013circa 1525) to integrate the\nStagirite within the Hebraic philosophical tradition. A minority of\nJewish authors, including Moses Isserles (1520\u20131572), considered\nnatural philosophy a useful tool for demonstrating the glory of God.\n\n",
