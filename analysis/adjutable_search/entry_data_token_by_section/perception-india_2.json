    "main_text": "Perspectives on Perception || Buddhist nominalism\n2.1 Buddhist nominalism\n\nThe oldest preserved definition of perception in the Buddhist\ntradition is the one by Vasubandhu (c. 4th century CE),\n\u201cPerception is a cognition [that arises] from that object [which\nis represented therein]\u201d (Frauwallner, 1957, p. 120). However,\nthe more influential and much discussed view is that of later Buddhist\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra philosopher Di\u1e45n\u0101ga (c. 480\u2013540\nCE) for whom perception is simply a cognition \u201cdevoid of\nconceptual construction (kalpan\u0101podha\u1e43)\u201d.\nTaber (2005, p. 8) notes two important implications of this\ndefinition. First, perception is non-conceptual in nature; no seeing\nis seeing-as, because that necessarily involves intervention of\nconceptual constructs, which contaminate the pristine given.\nPerception is mere awareness of bare particulars without any\nidentification or association with words for, according to\nDi\u1e45n\u0101ga, such association always results in falsification\nof the object. Referents of the words are universals which, for the\nBuddhist, are not real features of the world. Second,\nDi\u1e45n\u0101ga\u2019s definition only indicates a\nphenomenological feature of perception; it says nothing about its\norigin and does not imply that it arises from the contact of a sense\nfaculty with the object. Therefore, for the Buddhist idealist, the\nobject that appears in perceptual cognition need not be an external\nphysical object, but a form that arises within consciousness itself.\nBoth these ideas led to vigorous debates in classical Indian\nphilosophy between the Hindus and the Buddhists. The first of these\nideas relates to the notion of non-conceptual perception, the second\nto idealism. Di\u1e45n\u0101ga\u2019s philosophy is\nidealist-nominalist in spirit and his epistemological position is in\nsync with the Buddhist metaphysical doctrines of no-self, evanescence\nof all that exists and emptiness which, expectedly, evoke strong\nreaction from the realist Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015bes\u0323ika and\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 schools.\n\nIn recent literature, there has been a scholarly debate on whether the\nIndian Yog\u0101c\u0101ra philosophy is a form of idealism or not.\nThis debate is murky because there are various versions of idealism\ndiscussed in the literature in Buddhist philosophy. At least three\nversions have been discussed in recent literature in Buddhist\nphilosophy: subjective idealism (the view that there are no\nmind-independent objects); metaphysical idealism (the view that\nexternal objects do not exist); and, epistemic idealism (the view that\nwhat we are immediately aware of is intrinsic to cognition). Lusthaus\n(2002) and Coseru (2012) have argued, respectively, for a\n\u201cphenomenological\u201d and \u201cphenomenalist\nnaturalist\u201d interpretation of Yog\u0101c\u0101ra in opposition\nto the standard idealist interpretation. The main argument for the\nphenomenological reading is that the epistemic claims made by the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra philosophers do not commit them to ontological\nclaims. This would avoid the charge of metaphysical idealism but is\nstill open to being interpreted as offering an epistemic or subjective\nidealism. Lusthaus sees Yog\u0101c\u0101ra philosophers\u2019 denial\nof solipsism and affirmation of other minds as a fatal blow to the\nsubjective idealist interpretation of Yog\u0101c\u0101ra. Idealism\ndoes not necessitate solipsism as is made clear in Berkeley\u2019s\nversion of subjective idealism and Hegel\u2019s absolute idealism\nwhich explicitly requires other minds. Thus, there is reason to think\nthat the epistemic idealist interpretation of Yog\u0101c\u0101ra is\nnot threatened by its commitment to other minds.\n\nKellner and Taber (2014) have argued that Vasubandhu\u2019s argues\nfor a standard metaphysical idealist position, which is to deny the\nexistence of physical objects outside of consciousness.Kellner and\nTaber (2014) also present a new reason for the revival of the standard\nidealist reading of Yog\u0101c\u0101ra. Their argument for this\nreading is based on Vasubandhu\u2019s argumentative strategy rather\nthan the logical structure of individual proofs. They claim that in\nthe Vi\u1e43\u015bik\u0101 Vasubandhu uses the argument from\nignorance, according to which, the absence of external objects is\nderived from the absence of evidence for their existence. They also\nnote that Vasubandhu uses the same strategy to refute the existence of\nthe self in the Abhidharmako\u015babh\u0101\u1e63ya IX. The\nargument from ignorance seems like a bad strategy. It is often listed\nas a logical fallacy of the general form: since statement P is\nnot known or proved to be true, P is false. But because the\ngeneral form of the argument is bad, it does not necessarily follow\nthat every argument of that form is unsuccessful. It may well succeed\nbecause of other features, for example the semantic meanings of the\nterms or when the arguments are arguments to the best explanation.\nKellner and Taber emphasise that some arguments from ignorance are\nsuccessful when they function as arguments to the best explanation\nespecially in contexts where there are agreed-upon standards of\nverification. For example, the medical community agrees that the most\naccurate and sensitive test for typhoid is testing the bone marrow for\nSalmonella typhi bacteria. If it turns out that it cannot be proven\nthat one has typhoid (because of the lack of Salmonella typhi bacteria\nin one\u2019s bone marrow), then it is false that one has typhoid. No\nmatter how suggestive the symptoms are, if the specific bacteria do\nnot show up in the bone marrow within a specific time period, then one\ndoes not have typhoid. So, then, the question is: Is\nVasubandhu\u2019s argument from ignorance successful for establishing\nidealism? I fear not. That is because there are no universally\nagreed-upon criteria among Classical Indian philosophers (not even\namong fellow-Buddhists) as to what counts as evidence for the\nexistence of external things.\n\nMore recently in a series of papers on Buddhist idealism, Kellner\n(2017a) revisits Vasubandhu\u2019s argument from ignorance to\nestablish the non-existence of external objects and\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s objections to it. Dharmak\u012brti was among\nthe first Indian logician\u2019s to pay attention to how we can know\nabout non-existence. Dharmak\u012brti is worried about the validity of\narguments from ignorance in general and was the first to argue that\nthese arguments cannot be used to establish the absence of a class of\nentities. He posits non-apprehension (anupalabdhi) as a\nspecial kind of reason (hetu) to prove non-existence of\nobjects, but is careful to qualify again that non-apprehension can\nonly prove the situationally specific absence of particular objects,\nit cannot prove the non-existence of an entire class of objects.\nArguments from ignorance and non-apprehension cannot prove the\nontological non-existence of objects. Dharmak\u012brti thus is only\ninterested in supporting the weaker epistemic idealist position that\nexternal objects are imperceptible. As far as his arguments go they\nnever establish anything beyond this conclusion. Some, for example\nRati\u00e9 (2014, 361) argue that Dharmak\u012brti does not need to\nadd anything to this to establish the stronger metaphysical idealism.\nThe stronger thesis follows because of his ontological principle\n\u201cto be is to be causally efficacious\u201d\n(arthakriy\u0101). If external objects are completely\nimperceptible in that they cannt even produce the minimal effect of\nperceptual awareness, then they are as good as being non-existent.\nKellner, however, notes that such a conclusion is excluded by\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s logical theory which highlights the\nevidential gap between imperceptibility and non-existence. For him,\nabsence of evidence does not equate to evidence of absence.\n\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s target is to show that external objects are\nimperceptible, any further conclusion about the existence or otherwise\nis totally irrelevant, only to be oursued by those interested in\nfutile metaphysical arguments. Following Kellner (2017b) his argments\nfor the imperceptibility of external obejcts can be divided into two\ngroups. The first group of arguments point to defects in the realist\ntheory of perception supported by the Hindus and fellow Buddhists. The\nsecond group focuses on positive argument against the imperceptibility\nof external objects based on the nature of cognition. It is this group\nwhich contains Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s distinctive and novel\ncontribution to the debate and deserve much more attention than they\nhave received in the contemporary philosophical literature. The first\ngroup of arguments leads Dharmak\u012brti to conclude the\nself-reflexive nature of cognition. Cognition is \u2018aware of\nitself\u2019 and of nothing else. The second group of arguments then\ndefends this conclusion by appeal to the nature of cognition.\n\nDharmak\u012brti begins by pointing to the well-known fact that there\nis incongruence between the external object and our perception of it.\nVisual perception, for example, is limited to certain aspects or\nfeatures of the object. The external object as a whole is never\nvisually perceived. We do not perceive cups and pots, but only its\ncolour, shape, size and so on. So, he asks, what reason is there to\ncup and pots over and above visual perception of shapes, sizes and\ncolours. This incongruence allows him to conclude that perception does\nnot have the form of the external object or it\u2019s form is\ndeviant. Next he questions whether the realist commitment to causation\nand resemblance between the form (image, impression) and the external\nobject establishes that perception must have external objects.\nCausation cannot work on its own by virtue of the well-known fact that\nour cognitions can and do have internal mental causes. And the notion\nof resemblance is too weak and vague to do any real work in\nindexically linking particular forms to objects in front of\none\u2019s eyes. These two negative arguments suggest the conclusion\nthat there is no external object to be experienced by cognition. This\nconclusion is then supported by two further positive arguments\nreferred to as sa\u1e43vedana-argument and the\nsahopalambhaniyama-inference in the literature. The\nsa\u1e43vedana-argument appeals to the nature of cognition\nas that which appears in a certain way. And this\n\u201cappearing-to-in-a-certain-way\u201d highlights the\nintransitive nature of cognition. Cogniton by its nature is\nself-illuminating, it shines forth itself. This argument is no doubt\nterse and can do with further explication but Dharmak\u012brti does\nnot elaborate. The second argument,\nsahopalambhaniyama-inference is also tersely encapsulated in\na single sentence in the text: \u201cNo object [is observed] without\nawareness, nor is an awareness observed being experienced without an\nobject; thus they are not different\u201d\n(Pratyak\u1e63apariccheda, 390). Taber (2010, 292\u20133)\npresents a useful reconstruction of the argument. The argument draws\non the logical principle of Identity of Indiscernibles: two things\nhaving exactly the same properties are identical. However, the\nargument at issue just points to sharing of one crucial propert: the\nproperty of being perceived at the same time. This crucial property is\nregarded as sufficient evidence to establish that the two things are\n\u201cnon-different\u201d. Both these arguments deserve further\nelaboration before we can properly assess whether they are succesful\nin establishing the conclusion. This new literature in ceratinly a\nstart in the right direction and opens up new research questions for\ncontemporary philosophers.\n",
