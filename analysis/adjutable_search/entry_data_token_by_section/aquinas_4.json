Form and Matter\n\nGiven the preeminence of intellectual beings in the created order, it\nshould be no surprise that most of God\u2019s creative efforts went\ninto their establishment. This is, primarily, the domain of the\nangels, who \u201cexceed in number, incomparably, material\nsubstances\u201d (ST 1a 50.3c). The angels are wholly\nimmaterial beings, which makes them unlike us (\u00a75) and unlike the\ncreated world with which we are directly acquainted, which is a\nmaterial world. So, if we set aside the realm of immaterial\nminds\u2014God, angels, the human soul\u2014we are left with a world\nof material objects, suitable to be understood in terms of an\nAristotelian hylomorphic (matter\u2013form) analysis.\n\nWithin this material domain, a material substratum underlies all\nchange, and real change typically involves the gain or loss of some\nform. This can be made to look straightforward enough when examples\nare carefully chosen. If a tree\u2019s limbs are bent under the\nweight of an early fall snowstorm, then the tree undergoes alteration\n(accidental change) in virtue of taking on a new shape (a new\naccidental form), while the material substance (the tree itself)\nendures. If the storm in fact kills the tree, then the substance is\ncorrupted (a substantial change), in virtue of losing its substantial\nform, which is the internal principle that gives the substance its\nnature. In cases like this, where the substance is destroyed, Aquinas\nadvances a metaphysical claim that is quite surprising: that all that\nendures through the change is the most basic material substratum,\nprime matter, which lacks all form. (Aquinas\u2019s early\nOn the Principles of Nature summarizes the basic story. For\ngeneral discussions of Aquinas\u2019s metaphysics of material bodies\nsee Wippel 2000 chs. 7\u20139, Brower 2014. On causation at the level\nof creatures see Frost 2022.)\n\nThe resulting picture seems to postulate, as the constituents of\nsubstances, three types of basic entities: prime matter, substantial\nforms, and accidental forms. How exactly to understand each of these\nhas been subject to a great deal of discussion over the centuries.\nWith respect to accidental forms, one of the chief puzzles is to\ndefine those cases in which we have a genuine change of form. Aquinas\nclearly thinks, for instance, that colors and other proper sensibles\nare accidental forms. But does he think, as the above example of the\ntree implied, that shapes too are accidental forms? It is not entirely\nclear, and depends on difficult questions about how he understands\nAristotle\u2019s theory of the\n categories\n (Wippel 2000 ch. 7; Pasnau 2011 ch. 12). With respect to substantial\nform there is an analogous problem arising from unclarity over what\nexactly the substances are (Pasnau 2002 ch. 3; Rota 2004; Marmodoro\nand Page 2016). He clearly takes all living things to be substances,\nalthough there are puzzles here about how to define the beginning and\nend of life (Van Dyke 2012; Amerini 2009 [2013]). When it comes to\nnonliving things the situation is still less clear. He clearly thinks\nthat artifacts like a house are not substances. Water is a substance,\nbut it is not clear whether a puddle of water is a single substance or\na collection of substances. Aquinas does not discuss these issues in\nthe sort of detail that later medieval authors would, and as a result\nthere is little scholarly consensus about his views. But one important\nguide to his thinking about substances is that they have unity in a\nvery strong sense: \u201cwhatever is one in substance is one\nabsolutely (simpliciter)\u201d (ST 1a2ae 17.4c). Of\ncourse, no creature has the sort of unity that God has; God\u2019s\nperfect simplicity precludes even the composition of essence and\nexistence, which is found in all created substances, even in\nimmaterial angels (Wippel 2000 ch. 5). Material substances, being\ncomposites of form and matter, have less unity than the angels. Even\nso, Aquinas thinks there can be complex material substances, unified\nby their substantial form. How does a substantial form unify? An\nimportant part of his answer is that a substantial form actualizes not\nonly the whole substance, but each part: \u201ca form of the whole\nthat does not give existence to the individual parts of the body,\n\u2026 such as the form of a house, is an accidental form\u201d\n(ST 1a 76.8c).\n\nSubstantial forms both unify a substance at a given time and\nindividuate a substance over time. To play this role, they must be\nparticulars rather than\n universals.\n In general, it seems that Aquinas thinks that no forms are universals\nexcept inasmuch as we conceive of them in abstraction from\nparticulars. In external reality (in re), \u201cno\ncommonness is found in Socrates; rather, whatever is in him has been\nindividuated\u201d (On Being and Essence 3.80\u20132;\nLeftow 2003; Brower 2016). The principle of individuation, for forms,\nis matter (King 2000; Klima 2000). The account of individuation, then,\ncomes in two stages: matter individuates the form at the start, when\nthe form first inheres in that matter, and from that point forward the\nform possesses a fixed identity of its own. If it is a substantial\nform, it subsequently individuates the substance as a whole.\n\nFundamental to Aquinas\u2019s hylomorphism is his coordinate\ndistinction between potentiality and actuality. His brief treatise\nOn the Principles of Nature, perhaps his earliest work,\nbegins with this remark:\n\nOne should know that some things can be, although they are not, and\nsome things are. That which can be is said to be in potentiality; that\nwhich is now is said to be in actuality.\n\n\nHe goes on to associate potentiality with matter, and actuality with\nform, and draws the distinctions we would expect between the various\nkinds of matters and forms. He also remarks at this point that being\nis of two kinds, and that the being of a substance is \u201csomething\ndifferent\u201d from accidental being. This signals his commitment to\nAristotle\u2019s doctrine of the multivocity (or homonymy) of being.\nWhat it means for a substance to exist is different from what it means\nfor an accidental aggregation of a substance with its accidents (say,\na pale man) to exist. In general, what properly exists is substances,\nwhereas \u201cforms, accidents, and other things of this sort are\ncalled beings not because they themselves exist, but because it is\nby them that something exists\u201d (ST 1a 45.4c).\nMoreover, even among substances, God does not exist in the same way\nthat creatures do, but only in an analogous way (\u00a72). This denial\nof the univocity of being was contentious among later medieval authors\n(most notably\n John Duns Scotus)\n and its correct interpretation remains controversial today (Brower\n2014; Pasnau 2018). Even more problematic is Aquinas\u2019s\nconception of prime matter, which he characterizes as pure\npotentiality: \u201cbeing in actuality is incompatible with\nmatter\u2019s nature, since matter is a potential existent by its\nvery nature\u201d (Quodlibet III.1.1). Although later\nmedieval Aristotelians accepted that substantial change requires a\nmaterial substratum, hardly anyone endorsed Aquinas\u2019s suggestion\nthat it is pure potentiality, because they were convinced that what\nlacks actuality does not exist. Readers of Aquinas have disputed how\nhe himself could have evaded that outcome (Brower 2014 ch. 5), or\nwhether perhaps it is an outcome he intended (Pasnau 2002 ch. 1).\n",
