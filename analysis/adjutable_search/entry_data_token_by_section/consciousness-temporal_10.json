    "main_text": "Retentional Approaches || Brentano and Husserl\n4.2 Brentano and Husserl\n\nBrentano recognized that reaching a clear understanding of how it is\npossible for us to directly experience succession and persistence is a\ncentral issue for phenomenology (or \u201cdescriptive\npsychology\u201d as he preferred to call it). He also recognized that\na mere succession of experiences does not, in and of itself, add up to\nan experience of succession. Brentano\u2019s solution: when listening\n(say) to an extended tone or melody, at each moment you are aware of a\nmomentary sound-phase, but you are also (and simultaneously) aware of\na series of representations (or retentions) of the immediately\npreceding phases. The latter Brentano referred to as\nproteraesthesis. Brentano\u2019s approach gives rise to\nseveral questions. How can contents which are simultaneous,\nobjectively speaking, seem to be successive? What is the precise\nnature of the representations occurring in proteraestheses?\nBrentano\u2019s views on these matters underwent several\nchanges\u2014see Chisholm (1981) and Kraus (1930 [1976]) for further\ndetails.\n\nThe early years of the twentieth century see Husserl developing an\naccount of time-consciousness along retentional lines. Husserl\nattended Brentano\u2019s lectures between 1884\u20136; inspired by\nthem, he decided to devote his energies to philosophy rather than\nmathematics. In elaborating his own position, in lectures in\n1904\u20136, Husserl begins with criticisms of what Brentano (and\nMeinong) had to say on the topic, but the position he ends up with is\nalong the same general lines. Husserl may not have adopted the term\n\u201cspecious present\u201d, but he did hold that we have a\nseemingly direct awareness of change and persistence amongst the\nobjects and processes we perceive over short intervals. He also held,\nplausibly, that as our streams of consciousness flow on, we have an\nawareness of their so doing. As for how this is possible, he thought\nit must involve past phases of consciousness somehow being\n\u201cretained in grasp\u201d in later moments of consciousness.\n\nAt the heart of Husserl\u2019s account is a dynamic tri-partite view\nof the composition of consciousness at any instant. The three\ncomponents are: primal impressions, retentions (or\n\u201cprimary memories\u201d) and protentions. Primal\nimpressions are the live, actual experiences that occupy the momentary\nnow. No sooner does a primal impression occur than it slips seamlessly\ninto the past. But it does not vanish from consciousness altogether:\nit survives in the form of a retention, which presents it as\npast. For Husserl, retentions are a quite distinctive form of\nconsciousness, and differ significantly from ordinary memories. As for\nprotentions, these are the future-oriented counterparts of retentions.\nIn some cases\u2014e.g., when we are perceiving or remembering a\nfamiliar sequence of events\u2014they can be quite detailed, but\noften they consist of nothing more than an openness to the\nfuture, an expectation that something will come.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1 Husserl\u2019s time diagram.\n[An\n extended description of Figure 4.1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThe basic mechanics of Husserl's theory are depicted in\n Figure 4.1,\n where the horizontal axis represents a continuous flow of primal\nimpressions, the vertical axes represent a selection of retentions\n(and in the case of F) protentions which accompany the primal\nimpressions D, E and F. (Only a \u201cselection\u201d because in\nreality, according to Husserl, a continuous stretch of consciousness\nconsists of a dense continuum of primal impressions, each of which is\naccompanied by its \u201ccomet\u2019s tail\u201d of retentions and\nprotentions.) As can be seen, individual primal impressions are\nretained in later specious presents\u2014increased\n\u201cpastness\u201d is indicated by a greater number of asterisks.\nWhat goes for momentary primal impressions also goes for intervals:\nD-E is retained at F in the form of the retentional continuum\nE*\u2013D**.\n\nThe broad outlines of Husserl\u2019s position may be clear enough,\nbut the details pose more of a challenge. Husserl wrote voluminously\non time-consciousness throughout his career but never found a position\nhe was happy with for long\u2014in his lectures from 1907\u201310 he\nfound fault with the position he elaborated in the 1904\u20136\nlectures\u2014and he never published a definitive statement of his\nposition. For useful introductions to Husserl\u2019s views see\nKortooms (2002) and Zahavi (2004, 2007, 2010).\n",
