    "main_text": "Algebras and their philosophy\n4. The philosophy of necessity\n\n\nPeirce seems to have upheld his theological stance for all mathematics,\nand a little sign is evident in the dedication at its head: \nTo my friends This work has been the pleasantest\nmathematical effort of my life. In no other have I seemed to myself to\nhave received so full a reward for my mental labor in the novelty and\nbreadth of the results. I presume that to the uninitiated the formulae\nwill appear cold and cheerless. But let it be remembered that, like\nother mathematical formulae, they find their origin in the divine\nsource of all geometry. Whether I shall have the satisfaction of taking\npart in their exposition, or whether that will remain for some more\nprofound expositer, will be seen in the future (Peirce 1870,\n1).\n\n\nPeirce began with a philosophical statement of a different kind about\nmathematics which has become his best remembered single statement\n\u201cMathematics is the science that draws necessary conclusions\u201d (Peirce\n1870, p. 1). What does \u2018necessary\u2019 denote? Perhaps he was\nfollowing a tradition in algebra, upheld especially by Britons such as\nGeorge Peacock and Augustus De Morgan (a recipient of the lithograph),\nof distinguishing the \u2018form\u2019 of an algebra from its\n\u2018matter\u2019 (that is, an interpretation or application to a\ngiven mathematical and/or physical situation) and claiming that its\nform alone would deliver the consequences from the premises. In his\nfirst draft of his text he wrote the rather more comprehensible\n\u201cMathematics is the science that draws inferences\u201d, and in the second\ndraft \u201cMathematics is the science that draws consequences\u201d, though the\nlast word was altered to yield the enigmatic form involving\n\u2018necessary\u2019 used in the book. The change is not just\nverbal; he must have realised that the earlier forms were not\nsufficient (they are satisfied by other sciences, for example), and so\nadded the crucial adjective. Certainly no whiff of modal logic was in\nhis air. His statement appears in the mathematical literature fairly\noften, but usually without explanation. One feature is clear, but often\nis not stressed. In all versions Peirce always used the active verb\n\u2018draws\u2019: mathematics was concerned with the act of drawing\nconclusions, not with the theory of so acting, which belonged in\ndisciplines such as logic. He continued: \nMathematics, as here defined, belongs to every enquiry;\nmoral as well as physical. Even the rules of logic, by which it is\nrigidly bound could not be deduced without its aid (Peirce 1870,\n3).\n\n\nIn a lecture of the late 1870s he described his definition as \nwider than the ordinary definitions. It is subjective; they\nare objective. This will include knowledge in all lines of research.\nUnder this definition mathematics applies to every mode of enquiry\n(Peirce 1880, 377).\n\n\nThus Peirce maintained the position asserted by Boole that mathematics\ncould be used to analyse logic, not the vice versa relationship between\nthe two disciplines that Gottlob Frege was about to put forward for\narithmetic, and which Bertrand Russell was optimistically to claim for\nall mathematics during the 1900s. Curiously, the third draft\nof the lithograph contains this contrary stance in \u201cMathematics, as\nhere defined, belongs to every enquiry; it is even a portion of\ndeductive logic, to the laws of which it is rigidly subject\u201d; but by\ncompletion he had changed his mind. Peirce's son Charles claimed to\nhave influenced his father in forming his definitive position, and\nfiercely upheld it himself; thereby he helped to forge a wide division\nbetween the algebraic logic which he was developing from the early\n1870s with his father, Boole and de Morgan as chief formative\ninfluences, and the logicism (as it became called later) of Frege and\nRussell and also the \u2018mathematical logic\u2019 of Giuseppe Peano\nand his school in Turin (Grattan-Guinness 1988). \n",
