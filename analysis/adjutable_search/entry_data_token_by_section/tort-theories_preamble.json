    "main_text": "\n\nTort is a branch of private law. It focuses on interpersonal\nwrongdoing primarily between private persons. Unlike the law of\ncontract, tort obligations are not normally entered into voluntarily;\nunlike the criminal law, the state is not necessarily a party to a\ntort action. Private persons can often contract around the rights and\nobligations of tort law; those rights and obligations provide the\nbackground against which other private arrangements can be made.\nProminent examples of torts include negligent injury, battery, deceit,\nand defamation. In each case, the existence of the legal right that\nhas been violated does not depend on any prior act of the injured\nparty. Instead, everyone has rights against these types of conduct on\nthe part of others. Tort law engages with two of the most fundamental\nquestions of morality and social life: how people are permitted to\ntreat each other, and whose problem it is when things go wrong.\n\nThis entry examines philosophical accounts of tort law, distinguishing\nits obligations from other types of private legal obligation, and\ndistinguishing its characteristic remedies from the punitive responses\nof the criminal law and from administrative regulation. It focuses\nexclusively on tort law within common law systems, that is, legal\nsystems descended from English law, including Australia, Canada, New\nZealand, Singapore, the United States. Other legal systems,\noriginating in continental Europe, are usually described as\n\u201ccivilian\u201d systems. They have detailed civil codes\ncovering many of the same issues as the common law of torts. Some\ncivilian systems share many doctrinal features with common-law system;\nothers, particularly France, offer fundamentally different ways of\ndealing with the same set of interactions and the problems to which\nthey give rise.\n",
