Aesthetics\n\nWorks of art, in Bloch\u2019s interpretation, are perfect examples of\nutopian objects, in that they always transcend their immediate\nmeanings and contexts and serve as non-contemporaneous indications of\nunrealized possibilities (Korstvedt 2010). They are the perfect\nembodiments of the highest happiness and intensive openness to the new\n(Holz 1975), and an artistic genius is the most proper medium of the\nnot-yet-conscious (Bloch 1954\u201359 [1986a: 122f.]). Works of art\nthus both embody the incompleteness of the world and mediate an\naesthetic experience that is, in its epistemic role, a primary vehicle\nof grasping the utopian, the radically new, by the human mind (Vidal\n1994). The term Bloch mostly used for characterizing art is\nVor-Schein (pre-appearance, sometimes also translated as\nanticipatory illumination), drawing on the classic idea of aesthetic\nappearance (Schein), which has the meaning of illusion or\nfiction. So art is not \u201cmere\u201d illusion, but an utopian\nanticipation. Thus, a perfect work of art is always imperfect, is\ncompleteness is complete because it is incomplete, that is, because it\ncontains within itself the fullness of the Not Yet.\n\nArt is\u2014like the world itself\u2014a laboratory, in which the\ninner and the outer interact and exchange identities (Hudson 1982)\nthus overcoming the narrowness of private experience and the\nestrangement of objectified cultural forms. It is inherently utopian\nprecisely because it sublimates the sensuous by staying sensuous,\nbecause it elevates the empirical reality by making the ideal happen\nin a sensuous form, and because it is an important medium of\nimagination. The productivity of an artist, their creative drive, is\nfor Bloch connected to the experience of lack in the actual present\n(\u201csomething\u2019s missing\u201d), and is directed towards the\nfuture absolute, the full adequacy of subject and object.\n\nTropes as media of reference are for Bloch instruments for\ncomprehending the unsettled reality and indicating its future\npossibilities, the mirrors of not-yet-become (GA 9: 293)\u2014be it\nin putting various phenomena together in view of a common telos (as in\nthe case of symbols) or in creating an irreducible multiplicity of\nreferences (as in the case of allegories). In producing the new by\ncombining heterogenous elements, these techniques are \n\n\na form of materialist cognition \u2026 designed to reveal traces of\nworld contents not given in the abstract appearance of capitalist\nsociety. (Hudson 1982: 2) \n\n\nBloch\u2019s philosophy of nature leads him to re-evaluate the\nconcept of the beauty in nature. Since the nature itself is utopian,\nit does its own creative work and is permeated by \u201creal\u201d\ntropes pertaining to its future potentialities.\n\nMusic, for Bloch, provides us with \u201cthe utopian sound of [\u2026]\nexistence\u201d (Bloch 1985d: 212) in the most immediately graspable way.\nMusic is both dynamic and material, following Bloch\u2019s vision of\nnature. It creates the way to comprehend an essential reality,\na fulfilled moment, the absolute, to externalize the pure inwardness,\nwhat in The Spirit of Utopia coincides with\n\u201cself-encounter\u201d (which Bloch also conjures by referring\nto Expressionist art) and is later extended to the whole of humanity\nencountering itself. Music is paradigmatically incomplete,\nnon-discursive, ineffable, and is the source of inexhaustible novelty\nand variability, a realm, in which the utopian, the future in the\npast, should be heard. Importantly, music is created and perceived in\nthe darkness of the lived moment and affects the subjectivity in the\nmost direct and profound way, by dynamizing it, bringing it into\nmotion.\n\nMusic begins as \u201csinging-to-oneself\u201d, which is conceived\nas an analogy to the darkness of the lived moment that should be\novercome in the further dialectical progression of musical formations,\nor categories. The general pattern of this progression is gradual\nemancipation from immediate practical entanglements of the\n\u201ctone\u201d, the dialectics playing out between human\nexpression and objective form, between the material/emotional, and the\ntechnical (Korstvedt 2010). This interplay was first conceived by\nBloch in his analysis of the ornament in The Spirit of Utopia\nwhile juxtaposing the Egyptian art as a dead, merely external form and\na Gothic art, in which the human dimension becomes prominent. In\nThe Principle of Hope, Bloch further emphasizes the social\nconditioning and direct social influence of music, its powers to\ntransgress the context, to which it most immediately relates (Levitas\n2013). The dialectic of the material and the ideal in\n tone,[11]\n unlike in Hegel\u2019s philosophy of music Bloch largely follows, is\nnot fully resolved in the overarching subjectivity of spirit but keeps\nreproducing a tension and a productive utopian indeterminacy (Gallope\n2017).\n\nAn important feature of Bloch\u2019s aesthetics is the focus on the\nsmall, seemingly insignificant, and on the mundane (Jameson 1971): in\nThe Spirit of Utopia, he praises applied art and crafts;\nlater, while working a lot as a cultural critic, he turns to popular\nculture, in particular, fairy tales, adventure stories and detective\nnovels. The Principle of Hope, besides being a work in\nphilosophy, is also an encyclopedia of utopian motives in visual art,\narchitecture, but also in all genres of literature, popular culture,\nmythology, and everyday life. Bloch was practicing utopian\nhermeneutics in discovering the potentialities in various aesthetic\nforms and exploring the aspects of poetic non-contemporaneity in\ncertain works of art that get re-actualized in different historical\ncontexts, and in literary characters (such as Don Quixote), who\nexemplify the utopian transgression.\n\nIn the detective novel, the small details are crucial, as well as the\ndarkness of the lived moment (GA 9: 247, 260, see Bloch 1965 [1998]),\na fundamental obscurity of the crime that is driving the\ninvestigation. It is crucial for Bloch that this obscurity is not\nmerely something that should be elucidated epistemically. It is rather\nstill unclear to itself, like in the story of Oedipus (Bloch also\nconceded to psychoanalysis its role as hermeneutics of suspicion). The\nwhole world is thus becoming this investigation into its own obscure\norigins, while the detective hermeneutics\u2014including the one\npracticed by Benjamin\u2014becomes the major epistemological\nstrategy.\n\nFairy tale is for Bloch a genre that represents a victory over the\nstiflingly static mythical powers, its imagination is emancipatory and\nis directed at the future happiness (GA 9: 131), its general optimist\nhopeful attitude is recognized as that of an rational Enlightenment\nautonomy (Weissberg 1992). Popular literature of the\n \u201ccolportage\u201d[12]\n (particularly Karl May) was important for Bloch because of its\ndemocratic tendency, its grassroots nature, and its genuine wish for\nthe new, its dream for revolution (Edwards 2013). Romanticism was also\nre-functioned in view of its anti-bourgeois pathos. Following\nBloch\u2019s political philosophy, the elements of the conservative\nGerman culture\u2014from Hebel (Siebers 2011) to Wagner (Korstvedt\n2010)\u2014should also be saved.\n\nBloch\u2019s intellectual strategy became especially salient in the\ndebates on expressionism, an important aesthetic discussion of the\n1930s. Bloch argued, against Luk\u00e1cs, that in the hollow world\nof the contemporaneous capitalism, the avant-garde is the genuine\naesthetic achievement (Schmitt 1973; Ujma 1995). He insisted on the\nopenness and discontinuity of the true works of art, which he defended\nspeculatively already in The Spirit of Utopia (Riedel 1994),\nand focused on a fragment as a technique that conveys an inherently\nutopian potential. The aesthetic attitude propagated by Bloch, the\ndiscontinuous, shocking, estranging intervention in reality\u2014such\nas the technique of montage, or anacoluthon, a sudden\ninterruption in the flow of narrative\u2014is for him a true realism,\na mimesis faithful to a ubiquitous utopian surplus of the world,\nperformatively activating this surplus.\n",
