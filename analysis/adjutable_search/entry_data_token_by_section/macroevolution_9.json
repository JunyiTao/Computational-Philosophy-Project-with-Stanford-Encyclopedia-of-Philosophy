    "main_text": "Major Evolutionary Transitions\n10. The (Dis)unity of Macroevolutionary Theory\n\nOne significant and remaining challenge in the philosophy of\nmacroevolution is to work out how the various ideas about\nmacroevolution surveyed above may or may not fit together. What\nexactly is the relationship between punctuated equilibria and species\nselection? Or between PE and the major transitions? Or between species\nselection and historical contingency? Or between contingency and the\nmajor transitions? Do (some, all of) these ideas weave together to\nform a unified picture of evolution at large scales? Or do they\nrepresent something more like a heterogeneous grab bag of scientific\nideas that are more or less useful in different contexts? A further\nquestion is how the relative (dis)unity of macroevolutionary theory\nmight bear on the longstanding question of how macroevolution is\nrelated to microevolution.\n\nFinally, the investigation of macroevolution challenges the purported\ndistinction between the experimental and historical sciences (Sober\n1993; Cleland 2001). Investigation in this domain is historical and\noften emphasizes the deep past, to be sure, but it also involves\ntheoretical and prospective modeling, making predictions about what\nthe models will or will not find, making predictions about what\npaleontologists will or will not find, running bottle and other kinds\nof experiments, simulations, and more. The scientific study of\nmacroevolution is a philosophically rich and challenging field with\nmany deposits to mine.\n",
