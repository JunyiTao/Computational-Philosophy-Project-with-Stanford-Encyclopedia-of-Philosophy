    "main_text": "Proponents and opponents\n2. Proponents and opponents\n\n\nThe theories of universal hylomorphism and plurality of forms are\nfound together in many authors from the twelfth and thirteenth\ncentury.  They are both held, for instance, by the author known to the\nscholastics as \u201cAvicebron\u201d (or Avicebrol, Avencebrol, etc.), who is to\nbe identified with the Spanish Jewish philosopher and poet Solomon Ibn\nGabirol (c. 1022\u2013c. 1052/c. 1070), and whose Mekor Hayyim\n(=\u00a0Fons vitae, \u201cFountain of Life\u201d) was translated into Latin\nin the late-twelfth\n century.[9]\n Indeed, medieval as well as modern scholars have sometimes looked to\nIbn Gabirol as the main source for the two doctrines in the thirteenth\n century.[10]\n Other authors who held both theories included the translator of the\nFons vitae, one Dominic Gundisalvi \n (Gundissalinus)[11]\n as well as people as diverse as Thomas of \n York,[12]\n St. \n Bonaventure,[13]\n the anonymous thirteenth-century Summa philosophiae once\nascribed to Robert\n Grosseteste,[14]\n John Pecham, Richard of\n Mediavilla,[15]\n and many\n others.[16]\n\n\nBut other authors rejected these two views. The best known is no\ndoubt Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas held that the\nuniqueness of God's absolute simplicity does not require positing a\nkind of matter in all creatures. Rather all creatures, including\nincorporeal substances such as angels or human souls, are composite\ninsofar as they have a composition of essence and esse (\u201cto\nbe,\u201d the act of existing), whether or not they have an additional\ncomposition or matter and\n form.[17]\n Again, he argues that if any substance has a plurality of forms, only\nthe first form that comes to it can be a substantial form;\nall the others must be accidental\n forms.[18]\n Godfrey of Fontaines likewise rejected both theories. John Duns\nScotus accepted plurality of forms, but denied universal\n hylomorphism.[19]\n",
