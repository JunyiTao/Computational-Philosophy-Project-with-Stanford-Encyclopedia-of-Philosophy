    "main_text": "History || Origins\n2.1 Origins\n\nThis is not the place for a thorough historical account of analytical\nMarxism. However, it might be helpful to say something about its\norigins and relation to the annual workshop of the September\nGroup.\n\nAnalytical Marxism is sometimes conflated with participation in the\nSeptember Group. This is both understandable and unfortunate. It is\nunderstandable because of the close overlap between the two; many of\nthe best-known analytical Marxists (including the founding trio) were\nparticipants in the Group. And it is unfortunate because the two\nentities are distinct; their fates may often have overlapped but they\nare not synonymous.\n\nFirst, analytical Marxism existed prior to, and independently of, the\nSeptember Group. Each of the three founding figures had put\n\u201canalytic methods\u201d and Marxism together in their own work\nbefore they met the other two (see G. Cohen 1978, Elster 1978, and\nRoemer 1977), and before the formation of the Group.\n\n(Biographically speaking\u2014in understanding their positive\nresponse to analytical methods\u2014it may also be significant that\nthose three founding figures learnt their Marxism independently of,\nand prior to, their exposure to the analytical methods of their\nrespective academic disciplines. Thus Cohen and Roemer were\nindependently raised in North America by pro-Soviet parents, whilst\nElster came from \u201can intellectual left-wing family\u201d\nassociated with the Norwegian Labour Party (G. Cohen 2000b: xx; Roemer\n2019b\n [Other Internet Resources];\n and Elster 2018: 201).)\n\nSecond, much analytical Marxist work is by individuals who are not\nparticipants in the September Group. A list of some of these, drawn\nfrom assorted secondary literature, might include: Alan Carling,\nNorman Geras, Andrew Levine, Daniel Little, Richard Miller, Charles\nW. Mills, Richard Norman, Jeffrey Reiman, Debra Satz, David\nSchweickart, William Shaw, Tommie Shelby, Elliot Sober, Ian Steedman,\nNicholas Vrousalis, Robert Paul Wolff, and Allen Wood. All of those\nhave been characterised as producing work, at some point, in the\nanalytical Marxist mode, albeit that the list includes individuals who\nwould not identify themselves as analytical Marxists, and others who\nhave themselves criticised narrower versions of the tradition, such as\nrational choice Marxism (Wolff 1990)).\n\nSome will also think the relevant conflation mistaken because the September\nGroup is a diverse grouping of analytical Marxists and fellow\ntravellers. \u201cFellow travellers\u201d is intended here,\nnon-pejoratively, to refer to individuals sympathetic to, and\nintellectually cooperating with, but not themselves identifying,\neither as analytical Marxists, or, indeed, as Marxists of any stripe.\nIt might appear counterintuitive to characterise these fellow\ntravellers as analytical Marxists, but the present entry operates on\nthe basis of an expansive notion of analytical Marxism which includes\nall those working in the relevant mode\u2014both \u201cfellow\ntravellers\u201d in the September Group, and non-participants in the\nSeptember Group\u2014and attaches no special weight to\nself-identification.\n",
