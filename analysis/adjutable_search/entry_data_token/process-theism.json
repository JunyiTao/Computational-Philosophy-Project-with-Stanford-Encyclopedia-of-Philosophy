For both Whitehead and\nHartshorne, it is an essential attribute of God to be fully involved\nin and affected by temporal processes. This idea contrasts neatly with\ntraditional forms of theism that hold God to be or at least conceived\nas being, in all respects non-temporal (eternal), unchanging\n(immutable,) and unaffected by the world (impassible). Process theism\ndoes not deny that God is in some respects eternal,\nimmutable, and impassible, but it contradicts the classical view by\ninsisting that God is in some respects temporal, mutable, and\npassible. The views of Whitehead and Hartshorne should also be\ndistinguished from those that affirm that the divine being, by an act\nof self-limitation, opens itself to influence from the world. Some\nneo-Thomists hold this view and a group of Evangelical Christian\nphilosophers, calling themselves \u201copen theists,\u201d promote\nsimilar ideas. These forms of theism were influenced by process\ntheism, but they deny its claim that God is essentially in a\ngive-and-take relationship with the world. Moreover, process theism is\na genuinely philosophical theology in the sense that it is\nnot grounded in claims of special insight or revealed truth but in\nphilosophical reflection. Specifically, process theism is a product of\ntheorizing that takes the categories of becoming, change, and time as\nfoundational for metaphysics. The metaphysical underpinning of process\ntheism is often called process philosophy, a label suggested by the\ntitle of Whitehead\u2019s magnum opus, Process and Reality.\nIn order to bring out this philosophy\u2019s emphasis on relatedness,\nmany scholars follow Bernard Loomer in calling it process-relational\nphilosophy. Whitehead\u2019s preferred expression for his\nmetaphysical viewpoint is \u201cthe philosophy of organism.\u201d\nThis article concerns primarily the concept of God in process theism,\nalthough we shall conclude with a brief discussion of arguments for\nthe existence of God in process thought.\n", "toc": [{"#HistNoteProcThei": "1.

Historical Notes on Process Theism\n\nAlthough Whitehead was Hartshorne\u2019s senior by thirty-six years,\nthe two men began seriously to develop their ideas about God in\nwritten form at roughly the same time. In his Harvard doctoral\ndissertation (1923), Hartshorne argues for the existence of a God that\nis the eminent exemplification of relational and social values.\nWhitehead\u2019s writings on the concept of God appear only after\n1924, when he moved to America. Between the publication of Science\nand the Modern World (1925) and Process and Reality\n(1929)\u2014a time of intense creativity for Whitehead\u2014he\narticulated his metaphysical system, including the concept of God.\nDuring Whitehead\u2019s first year at Harvard, Hartshorne was in\nEurope for his second year as a Sheldon Traveling Fellow. When he\nreturned to Harvard in 1925 he was given the dual assignment of\nediting the papers of Charles Sanders Peirce and of serving as\nWhitehead\u2019s assistant. After 1940 Hartshorne became the primary\nconduit for Whitehead\u2019s theistic ideas. Indeed, the elaboration\nand defense of process theism fell largely to Hartshorne and his\nstudents at the University of Chicago (1928\u20131955), Emory\nUniversity (1955\u20131962), and the University of Texas at Austin\n(1962\u20132000). So great was Hartshorne\u2019s influence that some\nscholars try to rescue Whitehead from a too Hartshornean\ninterpretation. This fact should serve as a warning that\nHartshorne\u2019s version of process theism is not the same as\nWhitehead\u2019s. We shall see that Hartshorne\u2019s treatment of\ntheism owes much to Whitehead\u2019s metaphysics while departing from\nit in ways that the Englishman would not accept.\n\nHartshorne accepted the task of chronicling process theism\u2019s\nhistory and showing its importance as a significant alternative to\nclassical theism, pantheism, atheism, and other lesser known options\nin philosophical theology. His 1953 anthology (republished in 2000),\nPhilosophers Speak of God, edited with the help of his\nstudent William L. Reese, is a massive critical study of the varieties\nof concepts of God as they relate to process theism. The book includes\nselections from and commentaries on a wide range of thinkers from\nWestern and Eastern traditions, both well-known and obscure. It is\nsafe to say that Hartshorne\u2019s vigorous efforts on behalf of\nprocess theism are the single most important factor in eroding the\nconsensus among philosophers that an eternal, immutable, and\nimpassible deity should be considered normative for philosophical\ntheology. More recently, Daniel Dombrowski has examined the history of\nthe concept of God through the lens of process philosophy (Dombrowski\n2016).\n\nPhilosophers Speak of God demonstrates that Whitehead and\nHartshorne are not the sole representatives of process theism,\nalthough they are its chief exponents. Buddhism, with its twin\nemphases on impermanence and dependent origination, is arguably the\nmost sophisticated ancient form of process philosophy. Buddhist\nphilosophers criticized the notion of a timeless absolute without,\nhowever, developing a form of process theism (e.g. Arnold 1998).\nWhitehead remarks that his concept of God has more richness than the\nBuddhist concept of nirvana and that his philosophy of religion could\nbe viewed as an effort to \u201ctrue up\u201d the Buddhist idea\n(Johnson 1983, 8). Hartshorne maintains that aspects of process theism\nare in Plato\u2019s later writings\u2014specifically, the\nSophist, the Timaeus, and the\nLaws\u2014but they are never brought together into a\ncoherent theory. Hartshorne sees process theism as providing the\nneeded coherence (Dombrowski 2005 and Viney 2007).\n\nIn the generation immediately preceding Whitehead, C. S. Peirce\n(1839\u20131914) and William James (1842\u20131910) closely\nanticipated process theism and served as important influences on its\ndevelopment. There was also a cross fertilization of ideas from some\nof Whitehead\u2019s contemporaries: Henri Bergson (1859\u20131941),\nSamuel Alexander (1859\u20131938), and William Ernest Hocking\n(1873\u20131966)\u2014Hocking was one of Hartshorne\u2019s teachers\nat Harvard. Philosophers and religious thinkers who independently\nformulated aspects of process theism in the twentieth century include:\nBernardino Varisco (1850\u20131933), Nicholas Berdyaev\n(1874\u20131948), Mohammad Iqbal (1877\u20131938), Martin Buber\n(1878\u20131965), Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881\u20131955), Edgar\nSheffield Brightman (1884\u20131953), Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan\n(1888\u20131975), Sri Aurobindo (1892\u20131950), Hans Jonas\n(1903\u20131993), and Abraham Joshua Heschel (1907\u20131972).\n\nBecause process theists reject the idea of a deity whose moral\ncharacter is ever questionable, John Stuart Mill\u2019s essay,\n\u201cTheism,\u201d is not an anticipation of process\ntheism. By parity of reasoning, Peter Forrest\u2019s proposal of a\nGod that grows from pure power to pure love is not a version of theism\nthat process theists would find appealing (Forrest 2007). Some of the\ncentral themes and arguments of process theism, however, are evident\nin less well-known thinkers scattered throughout history. One can\nmention the names of Levi ben Gerson (1288\u20131340), Fausto Socinus\n(1539\u20131604), Friedrich Wilhelm Schelling (1775\u20131854),\nGustav Theodor Fechner (1801\u20131887), Rowland Gibson Hazard\n(1801\u20131888), Jules Lequyer [or Lequier] (1814\u20131862),\nLorenzo D. McCabe (1817\u20131897), and Otto Pfleiderer\n(1839\u20131908). Some might count G. W. F. Hegel (1770\u20131831)\nas a forerunner of process theism, but his case is not clear. The idea\nof development is central to Hegel\u2019s thinking about the Absolute\nSpirit. On the other hand, his philosophy was more influential in\nushering in what he himself called \u201cthe death of God\u201d than\nin providing a clearly articulated theistic alternative to\nclassical theism (cf. K\u00fcng 1980, 138\u201342). It is also ironic\nthat it was much less in the positive influence of Hegelian idealism\nthan in the negative reactions to it that process philosophy, and by\nimplication process theism, matured in the twentieth century.\n\nPhilosophers and theologians who have published a monograph defending\nsome variety of process theism informed by Whitehead or Hartshorne\ninclude: Henry Nelson Wieman (1884\u20131975), Bernard Meland\n(1899\u20131993), Paul Weiss (1901\u20132002), Norman Pittenger\n(1905\u20131997), Daniel Day Williams (1910\u20131973), John Moskop,\nWilliam L.

God and Creativity\n\nThe question of the metaphysical relation of God and creativity is a\nwatershed between process theism and more traditional forms of theism.\nProcess philosophy, modifying a statement from Plato\u2019s\nSophist (247e), affirms that the most concrete real\nbeings\u2014in Whitehead\u2019s language, actual entities\u2014are\ncharacterized by the power to act and to be acted upon (Plato\nsays real beings act or are acted upon). In process\nmetaphysics no actual entity is wholly determined by the activity of\nanother; or phrased positively, every actual entity retains\nsome power of self-determination, however minimal or slight\nit may be. According to this view, to have power in relation to others\nis to have power in relation to other entities with some degree of\npower. This is process philosophy\u2019s doctrine of universal\ncreativity. Hartshorne says, \u201cTo be is to create\u201d\n(Hartshorne 1970, 1, 272). The logic of the matter does not change if\nGod is included in the metaphysical scheme. For process theism, God is\nthe supreme or eminent creative power, but not the only creative\npower. Thus, process theists speak of God and the creatures as\nco-creators (Hartshorne and Reese 1953 [2000, 140]; Hartshorne 1967a,\n113).\n\nProcess theism\u2019s doctrine of creativity differs from that of\nclassical theism according to which God alone is genuinely creative.\nThomas Aquinas says that in the proper sense of the word, only God\ncreates (Summa Theologica I, Q 45, a. 5). Aquinas explains\nthat to create is to bring something from nothing, and this is\npossible only for deity. This is the famous doctrine of\ncreatio ex nihilo, or creation from no pre-existing\nmaterial. This ex nihilo creation is logically distinct from\nthe claim that the universe is temporally finite. Aquinas, for\nexample, treats the questions whether God is the creator and whether\nthe universe had a beginning under separate headings. Aquinas is clear\nthat he accepts the temporal finitude of the universe as a matter of\nfaith, from revelation, and not because of rational argument. On the\nother hand, like other traditional theists (Gottfried Leibniz for\nexample), Aquinas holds that God could have created a temporally\ninfinite universe, but it too would have been created ex\nnihilo.\n\nProcess theists generally, though not unanimously, deny that the\nuniverse had a first temporal moment. Those wishing to demonstrate the\ncompatibility between process theism and Jewish and Christian\nScripture commonly follow David Griffin\u2019s arguments that the\nBible neither requires nor implies an absolute beginning of the\nuniverse (Griffin 2001b, 109\u2013114). There is still the objection,\nhowever, that by conceiving both God and the creatures as creative,\nprocess theists seem to destroy one of the most meaningful contrasts\nbetween God and the world: God as creator and the world as created.\nIndeed, Whitehead says, \u201cIt is as true to say that God creates\nthe World, as that the World creates God\u201d (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 348]).\nOne must, however, separate Whitehead\u2019s poetic expression from\nhis philosophical meaning. In process theism, as in traditional\ntheism, the existence of God is in no way precarious, in no\nway dependent upon the activity of other entities; likewise, process\ntheism and traditional theism are in agreement that non-divine\nindividuals are contingent (they can fail to exist)\u2014in the case\nof non-angelic beings, they are born and they die. In\nWhitehead\u2019s and Hartshorne\u2019s form of theism, God\u2019s\nexistence is everlasting, but the existence of any particular creature\nis not. Nevertheless, the creatures, being lesser creators, create\nsomething in God, if only the knowledge of their own activity. For\nprocess theism, the activity of the creatures makes no difference to\nGod\u2019s existence, only to God\u2019s experience of them.\n\nImplicit in traditional theism\u2019s doctrine of creation are the\nideas that God\u2019s creative act and God\u2019s knowledge of the\nworld are non-temporal. Augustine, for example, in the\nConfessions (book XI, chapters 13 and 14), considers it\nnonsensical to ask what God was doing before the creation of the\nworld; God, in creating the universe, brings time\u2014and with it,\nrelations of before and after\u2014into existence; thus, it is no\nmore meaningful to ask what came before the first moment of\ntime than it is to ask on a spinning sphere what is north of the north\npole. In traditional theism, the temporal world is spread out before\nGod who can see it in its entirety from an eternal vantage point. As\nBoethius says in The Consolation of Philosophy (book 5, prose\n6), eternity is the complete, simultaneous and perfect possession of\neverlasting life. Process theism takes a contrary view that time\nis the process of creation. In other words, the order of beings\nin time is the process whereby beings are created. For process\nmetaphysics, there is no eternal act of divine creation that fixes the\nworld in existence and there is no eternal perspective from which the\nuniverse can be considered a finished product. Furthermore, the\n\u201ccreative advance,\u201d as Whitehead calls the universe, is\ninherently open-ended and growing, like a line to which tiny segments\nare continually being added. Where Aquinas could liken God\u2019s\nprescience to a man viewing a caravan of travelers from a high tower,\nHartshorne says, \u201cThere is not (either now or eternally) a fixed\ntotality of travelers for God to survey, but a new totality each\nmoment\u201d (Hartshorne 1970, 135).\n\nWhitehead remarks that, \u201cIn all philosophic theory there is an\nultimate which is actual in virtue of its accidents\u201d (Whitehead\n1929 [1978, 7]). In process thought, this ultimate is creativity. It would be\nmisleading, however, to speak as though creativity were \u201cthe\nultimate reality\u201d according to process theism (Hick 1990, 49).\nCreativity is not a metaphysical agency that produces anything;\nrather, it is the character of every concrete fact, from the humblest\nflicker of existence in non-divine actual entities to God.\nWhitehead\u2019s pithy summary of process philosophy is, \u201cThe\nmany become one, and are increased by one\u201d (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 21]).\nCreativity, then, is the ultimate metaphysical principle. A principle,\nhowever, is not a real being. Whitehead explained to his student A. H.\nJohnson that God is not a principle but an actuality (Johnson 1983,\n5). That which is best described, in process theism, as the ultimate\nreality, is God. For Whitehead and Hartshorne, God should not be\ntreated as the exception to metaphysical principles; otherwise, apart\nfrom an appeal to putative revelations from God, there could be no\nreasoned discourse about the divine. Whitehead and Hartshorne strive\nto conceive God as the chief exemplification of metaphysical\nprinciples. In process theism, the divine or eminent form of\ncreativity provides the basis for cosmic order and achieved value. In\nWhitehead\u2019s words, God is \u201cthe poet of the world,\u201d\nleading it with tender patience by the divine vision of truth, beauty,\nand goodness (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 346]).\n\nProcess theism is critical of the traditional metaphysical question,\n\u201cWhy is there something rather than nothing?\u201d In process\nthought, the proposition, \u201cSomething exists,\u201d is a\nnecessary truth (Hartshorne 1971). Insofar as traditional theism\nmaintains the doctrine of the necessary existence of God, it too\naccepts the necessity of something existing. Therefore, the difference\nbetween process theism and traditional theism is not in whether\nsomething necessarily exists, but in the nature of the\nnecessarily existent. According to traditional theism, the\ntotality of non-divine entities is a multiplicity in need of\ngrounding in a primordial unifying activity\u2014the \u201cpure\nact\u201d (actus purus) of existing that is God.\nProcess theism refuses to give a privileged metaphysical status to the\none over the many. In Whitehead\u2019s words, \u201cThe term\n\u2018many\u2019 presupposes the term \u2018one,\u2019 and the\nterm \u2018one\u2019 presupposes the term \u2018many\u2019\u201d\n(Whitehead 1929 [1978, 21]). Taking creativity as the category of the\nultimate is an attempt to keep the one and the many on equal\nmetaphysical footing by taking reality itself as necessarily social.\nGod, considered as the ultimate reality in any version of process\nmetaphysics, necessarily exists as a social being in dynamic\ninteraction with all non-divine entities.\n\nClearly, treating creativity as the ultimate metaphysical principle\nhas far-reaching consequences for the concept of God and of\nGod\u2019s relations to others. It is not possible, in process\nmetaphysics, to conceive divine activity as a\n\u201csupernatural\u201d intervention into the \u201cnatural\u201d\norder of events. Process theists usually regard the distinction\nbetween the supernatural and the natural as a by-product of the\ndoctrine of creation ex nihilo. In process thought, there is\nno such thing as a realm of the natural in contrast to that which is\nsupernatural. On the other hand, if \u201cthe natural\u201d is\ndefined more neutrally as \u201cwhat is in the nature of\nthings,\u201d then process metaphysics characterizes the natural as\nthe creative activity of actual entities. In Whitehead\u2019s words,\n\u201cIt lies in the nature of things that the many enter into\ncomplex unity\u201d (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 21]). It is tempting to emphasize\nprocess theism\u2019s denial of the supernatural and thereby\nhighlight what the process God cannot do in comparison to what the\ntraditional God can do (that is, to bring something from nothing). In\nfairness, however, equal stress should be placed on process\ntheism\u2019s denial of the natural (as traditionally conceived) so\nthat one may highlight what the creatures cannot do, in traditional\ntheism, in comparison to what they can do in process metaphysics (that\nis, to be part creators of the world with God).\n3. Real Relations in God\n\nProcess theists generally regard the notion of creation ex\nnihilo, as explained above, as going hand-in-hand with the idea\nthat the relations between God and the world are one-way relations.\nGod creates, but the creatures lack all creative power, the one wholly\nuncreated, the other wholly uncreative (Hartshorne 1970, 9). It is not\nwithin the ability of any creature, according to this view, to make a\ndifference to God. Aquinas\u2019s way of expressing this asymmetry is\nto say that the relation from God to the creatures is real (for it\nmakes a difference, all the difference, to them) whereas the relation\nfrom the creatures to God is rational, or in the mind only (for the\nexistence of the creatures makes no difference to the being of God)\n(Summa Theologica I, Q 13, a. 7). Aquinas borrows, and places\nin a Christian context, Aristotle\u2019s terms of \u201cpure\nact\u201d and \u201cunmoved mover\u201d to apply to God. To say\nthat God is pure act is to say that anything God could be, God already\nis\u2014there is no potentiality in God for any type of change. To\nsay that God is the unmoved mover is to say that the divine moves\nothers but is unmoved by another\u2014this includes the idea that God\nis impassible, literally, without feeling or emotion.\n\nIn the view of process theism, the denial of real relations in God\nrenders classical theism paradoxical to the point of incoherence.\nAccording to classical theism, God has perfect knowledge of a\ncontingent and changing world, yet nothing in God could be other than\nit is. The one condition, however, contradicts the other (cf.\nHartshorne 1948, 13\u201314; Viney and Shields 2020, 147-150). If any\nevent is contingent then it could be otherwise\u2014for example, this\nbird at this place and time is singing rather than sleeping; but if\nthe event could be otherwise, then God\u2019s knowledge of the event\ncould be otherwise\u2014knowing this bird at this place and time as\nsinging rather than as sleeping. The contingency implied for\nGod\u2019s knowing is not that God might have been ignorant of\nsomething but that the thing that God knows might have been different.\nAn infallible knower necessarily knows whatever exists; it does not\nfollow, however, that what exists is necessary unless one\nadds the premise, taken from classical theism, that nothing in God\ncould be other than it is. Process theism jettisons the premise that\nthere is nothing contingent in God. The only other non-atheistic\nalternatives, say process theists, are to follow Aristotle and deny\nthat God knows the world or to follow Spinoza and deny that nothing in\nGod or in the world could be other than it is (Hartshorne 1976, 12).\nWhat is impossible is a God with no contingent aspects knowing a\ncontingent world.\n\nThe denial of real relations in God also has paradoxical consequences\nfor the concept of divine goodness. If God is unaffected by the\ncreatures, then God is impassible, not moved by their suffering.\nAnselm, in Proslogion chapter VIII, asks how God can be\ncompassionate towards the creatures without feeling sympathy for them.\nHis answer\u2014in effect a kind of theological behaviorism\n(Dombrowski 2006, 140)\u2014is that the creatures feel the effects of\ndivine compassion but that God feels nothing. This leaves unanswered\nhow non-sympathetic compassion is possible. Aquinas provides a less\nobviously question begging reply. He says that to love another is to\nwill the good of the other; God necessarily wills the good of the\nother, so God is love (Summa Theologica I, Q 20, a. 2).\nProcess theists do not deny that love requires willing the good of the\nother, but they maintain that it requires something more, or at very\nleast that there are greater forms of love of which willing the good\nof the other is a necessary aspect. Divine love is more than\nbeneficence; it includes sensitivity to the joys and sorrows of the\nbeloved. This idea is expressed in Whitehead\u2019s depiction of God\nas \u201cthe great companion\u2014the fellow-sufferer who\nunderstands\u201d (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 351]). Hartshorne points out that\nAnselm\u2019s God can give us \u201ceverything except the right to\nbelieve that there is one who, with infinitely subtle and appropriate\nsensitivity, rejoices in all our joys and sorrows in all our\nsorrows\u201d (Hartshorne 1948, 54).\n\nClosely related to the problem of passionless love, for classical\ntheism, is the question of the world\u2019s value. The denial of real\nrelations in God, coupled with the concept that the world and its\ncreatures have no value except as it is borrowed from God, implies\nthat that total reality described by God-and-the-world\ncontains no more value than that described by\nGod-without-the-world. This view has two unhappy\nconsequences. First, it implies that there is no value in God\u2019s\ncreating the world\u2014nothing is gained, or lost, in God\u2019s\ndecision to create. Second, it implies that there is no value in\nGod\u2019s interaction with the creatures. Process theists point out\nthat these ideas do not square with analogies drawn from human\nexperience. There is value in giving one\u2019s love to another, as\nfor instance, bringing children into the world and loving them; there\nis also value in one\u2019s love being received and returned, as when\nthe children mature and cherish relations with their parents. Yet, one\ncannot love another unless the other exists, or once existed. Thus, if\nthere is a value in love, it requires the existence of the\nother, not merely the idea of the existence of the\nother. Process theism rejects the counter-intuitive claim that\nthe world as actually existing has no more value than the world as\npossibly existing. By parity of reasoning, process theism rejects the\nview that it is no better for God to create the world than to\ncontemplate the possibility of creating it.\n\nPerhaps the most disastrous consequences of the denial of real\nrelations in God, as far as process theists are concerned, are the\nproblems that it poses for free will and creaturely suffering. For\nclassical theism, the creative or causal relation flows one way only,\nfrom God to the world. The world and its creatures\nare products of a unilateral divine decision that things should be one\nway rather than another. Hartshorne poses a dilemma for this view.\nEither biological parents are part creators of their children or they\nare not. If they are then God alone is not the creator. On the other\nhand, if parents are not genuine creators of their children then the\ncreatures never create anything and we don\u2019t know what\n\u201ccreate\u201d means, for parents having children would seem to\nbe a paradigm of creation\u2014note the word\n\u201cprocreative\u201d (cf. Hartshorne 1987, 88\u201389).\nClassical theists accept precisely the implication that Hartshorne\nfinds absurd, namely, that the creatures never create anything. The\nThomist, for example, holds that one\u2019s parents are not creative;\nthey are the vehicles whereby matter-energy is rearranged so as to\nform (not to create) a new human being. Strictly speaking, for\nAquinas, what God creates is your-parents-having-you. Your\nparents had no part in your creation.\n\nAquinas\u2019s theory poses complications for human freedom. The\nreality described by your-parents-having-you includes the\ndecisions they make in having you. God, in creating that reality, also\ncreates those decisions. Aquinas says that God\u2019s will is\nperfectly efficacious\u2014that is, what God wills comes to pass.\nTherefore, your parents\u2019 decisions in\nyour-parents-having-you must occur. Would this view of\ndecision making jeopardize human freedom? Aquinas, representing\nclassical theism, says no, but Hartshorne, representing process\ntheism, says yes. In Aquinas\u2019s view, one\u2019s free decisions\nhave two sufficient explanations, one\u2019s own will and\nGod\u2019s will. In other words, God brings it about not only\nthat one freely decides something, but what one\nfreely decides (Summa Theologica I, Q 19, a. 8). Process\ntheists counter that multiple freedom (whether between God and the\ncreatures or among the creatures) implies the possibility of wills\ncoming into conflict or being in harmony. Hartshorne says, \u201cRisk\nand opportunity go together, not because God chooses to have it so,\nbut because opportunity without risk is meaningless or\ncontradictory\u201d (Hartshorne 1970, 238). If this is true, then it\nmust be possible for the will of the creatures to be at cross purposes\nwith the divine will. We have already seen that classical theists and\nprocess theists agree that God wills the good of the creatures. Human\nbeings, however, do not always will their own good, or the good of\nother people. In those cases, on the classical view, God brings it\nabout that people freely decide not to will the good of others.\nProcess theists argue that this makes God responsible for evil and\nsuffering in a way that contradicts divine goodness. On the classical\nview, for example, the crimes that disfigure human history are the\nfault of human beings, but they are also God\u2019s doing.\n\nClassical theists are not without responses to these criticisms. One\nwell-known reply, used by Augustine and Aquinas, is to invoke the\ndistinction between divine permission and divine causation of human\nwickedness and suffering. On this view, the evil in the world is\npermitted by God in order to bring about a greater good. For example,\nthe Exultet of the Easter Vigil, sometimes ascribed to Ambrose of\nMilan, speaks of the sin of Adam and Eve as a blessed fault (O\nfelix culpa!) that made possible the sacrificial death of Christ.\nProcess theists argue that there can be no distinction between\npermitting and causing in a being that creates the universe ex\nnihilo. On the principles of classical theism, whatever is\ndivinely \u201cpermitted\u201d is also divinely created to be as it\nis (cf. Griffin 1976, 63\u201364 and 82\u201383)\u2014this is one\nof the few points on which process theism agrees with John Calvin\n(Case-Winters, 1990, 71). On the process view, creaturely decisions\nare themselves acts of creation, which means that the universe is a\njoint product of God and the creatures. Process theists do not see\nhow, in creation ex nihilo, creaturely decisions that God\npermits are not orchestrated by God so as to fulfill the purposes God\nhas for them. Albert Einstein is reported to have said that God does\nnot play dice with the universe. Although he was not a classical\ntheist, his view on this issue is in accord with that philosophy. God\nmay, as it were, allow or permit the dice to fall where they may, but\nonly if they fall as God desires them to fall; this seems different in\nname only from playing with loaded dice. Hartshorne replies,\n\u201cEinstein\u2019s rejection of a \u2018dice-throwing God\u2019\nwas a great man\u2019s error. And human individuals are some of the\ndice \u2026\u201d (Hartshorne 1967a, 113).\n4. Dual Transcendence in Whitehead and Hartshorne\n\nThe dominant theological position in the West, which we have been\nreferring to as classical theism, denies all relativity to God. One\nmight suppose that the Christian doctrines of the Trinity and the\nIncarnation of God in Christ would temper disbelief in divine\nrelativity. The trend, however, was to argue that these doctrines do\nnot conflict with the denial of real relations in God. Claims of\nrevealed truth aside, the core doctrine has been that God, to be God,\nmust be in all respects absolute and in no respects relative. As goes\nthe contrast between absolute and relative, so go other metaphysical\ncontrasts. Theists traditionally held that God is in all\nrespects creator, active, infinite, eternal, necessary,\nindependent, immutable, and impassible and in no respects\ncreated, passive, finite, temporal, contingent, dependent, mutable, or\npassible. This view can be interpreted either as a doctrine about the\nnature of God or as a thesis about the parameters of responsible\ndiscourse about God (in the latter case it is called the via\nnegativa, or negative path). Hartshorne complains that, on\neither interpretation, traditional theology is guilty of a\n\u201cmonopolar prejudice,\u201d placing God (or talk about God) on\none side of polar contrasts and the world on the other. It is\nmonopolar insofar as deity is characterized by only one side\nof each pair of contrasts; it is prejudicial insofar as it\nholds to the invidious nature of the contrasts. As Hartshorne notes,\n\u201cOne pole of each contrary is regarded as more excellent than\nthe other, so that the supremely excellent being cannot be described\nby the other and inferior pole\u201d (Hartshorne and Reese 1953 [2000,\n2]).\n\nClassical theists certainly made provisions for speaking of God in\nways that suggested divine passion and even mutability. As Paul\nGavrilyuk argues, for the Church Fathers, divine impassibility was\nless a denial of God\u2019s emotional life than it was a qualifier\nthat ruled out \u201cpassions and experiences that were unbecoming of\nthe divine nature\u201d (Gavrilyuk 2004, 16). In a similar vein,\nMichael Dodds emphasizes that Aquinas did not construe divine\nimmutability as an attribute of God nor did he think that it implies\ninertness or stagnation. Nevertheless, Dodds, interpreting Aquinas,\nmaintains that immutability \u201cseems to signify divine being\n(esse) more appropriately [than mutability] since it more\nclearly indicates its distinction from all other things and its\ntranscendence of all human thought and language\u201d (Dodds 2008,\n157\u2013158).\n\nProcess theists also emphasize our limitations in knowing the reality\nof God, but they are not persuaded that it is best signified by only\none pair of the metaphysical contraries. If one is willing to concede\nthat God should not be conceived as immutable in the bad ways that\ncreatures are unchanging, why may not God be conceived as changeable\nin the good ways that creatures are, with the proviso that God\u2019s\nexcellence necessarily surpasses all else? Hartshorne notes that\nordinary language provides scanty support for and abundant evidence\nagainst the superiority of one pole over the other. We have already\nseen that process theism finds positive value in God\u2019s love\nbeing active as well as passive; it is as important that God wills the\ngood of the creatures as that God is affected by their joy and\nsuffering. Here is another of Hartshorne\u2019s many examples,\nexpressed with some humor:\n\nThe venerable dogma, \u2018agent is superior to patient\u2019, is\nnot derived from the study of knowledge. Indeed, it is not derived\nfrom any careful examination of ordinary cases. To speak is to be\nagent, to listen is to be patient, and those who want to show their\nsuperiority by speaking without listening are not trustworthy\nauthorities in the theory of value. (Hartshorne 1970, 231\u201332)\n\n\nHartshorne\u2019s larger point is that the pairs of metaphysical\ncontraries are not related as superior to inferior, but that\nthere are admirable and deficient manifestations of both sides. He\nsums this up in the principle of the non-invidiousness of the\nmetaphysical contraries (Hartshorne 1970, 268). If this principle\nis correct, and if God is conceived as the eminent embodiment of value\nand supremely worshipful being, then God must be conceived not in\nmonopolar terms but as dipolar, exemplifying the admirable forms of\nboth pairs of metaphysical contrasts. For example, rather than saying\nthat God is in all respects active and in no respects passive, the\nalternative is to say that God is active in some respects and passive\nin other respects, each in uniquely excellent ways. This is one\nmeaning of the expression \u201cdipolar theism\u201d; in light of\nother meanings to be given to \u201cdipolar\u201d in discussions of\nprocess theism, it is perhaps clearer to use Hartshorne\u2019s\nexpression for this idea: dual transcendence, that is to say,\nGod as the supreme embodiment of each pair of metaphysical\ncontraries.\n\nThe most elegant statement of dual transcendence is in the closing\npages of Process and Reality, a line of which we have already\nquoted. The complete quotation reads like a litany:\n\n\nIt is as true to say that God is permanent and the world fluent, as\nthat the World is permanent and God is fluent.\n\nIt is as true to say that God is one and the World many, as that the\nWorld is one and God many.\n\nIt is as true to say that, in comparison with the World, God is actual\neminently, as that, in comparison with God, the World is actual\neminently.\n\nIt is as true to say that the World is immanent in God, as that God is\nimmanent in the World.\n\nIt is as true to say that God transcends the World, as that the World\ntranscends God.\n\nIt is as true to say that God creates the World, as that the World\ncreates God. (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 348])\n\n\nWe saw above in the discussion of divine creativity that Whitehead\nindulges in poetic expression and that understanding his meaning\nrequires looking more closely at his metaphysical categories. Above\nall, however, what is required is a way of making principled\ndistinctions between different aspects of God so that the doctrine of\ndual transcendence does not collapse into contradiction. Let us\nexamine the different ways in which Whitehead and Hartshorne attempt\nto save the doctrine of dual transcendence from incoherence.\n4.1 Whitehead on the two natures of God\n\nIn Whitehead\u2019s philosophy, every actual entity has a physical\nand a mental pole. For this reason, Whitehead speaks of actual\nentities as \u201cdipolar\u201d (thus, a second meaning of the\nword). The physical and mental poles are aspects of every real being\n(actual entities) but they are not real beings themselves. In other\nwords, Whitehead is not a mind-body dualist. It is also important to\nnote that, for Whitehead, human consciousness is a higher form of\nmentality but not the only form. Thus, Whitehead does not claim that\nevery real being is a conscious entity. As with Leibniz, Whitehead\nrecognizes a continuum of mind-like qualities ranging from very\nprimitive feelings to the most advanced form of self-awareness.\nWhereas Leibniz speaks of every real being\u2014he calls them\nmonads\u2014as having apperception and appetition, Whitehead speaks\nof every actual entity as prehending, or grasping or taking\naccount of, its environment and as striving to realize the\nsubjective aim of coordinating its prehensions in some\ndeterminate fashion. In Process and Reality, Whitehead uses\nthe word \u201cfeeling\u201d as a synonym for prehension to indicate\nthe vector character of feelings\u2014a feeling is always a feeling\nof something. Whitehead\u2019s belief in a continuum of\nmental qualities fits neatly with evolutionary theory where it is\ncommonplace to conceive differing forms of organic complexity as\nassociated with differing levels of mental capacity. For example, the\nfrontal cortex of a human brain allows for more advanced mentality\nthan one finds in a chimpanzee, whose brain is not as complex.\n\nWhitehead is fully aware that there is an imaginative leap in applying\nthese categories to God, but he believes the application can be done\nin a disciplined and systematic fashion. Whitehead conceives God as an\nactual entity. In God, the physical and mental poles are called the\nconsequent nature and the primordial nature\nrespectively. As with the physical and mental poles of actual\nentities, so the two \u201cnatures\u201d are distinguishable but\ninseparable aspects of deity. That is to say, neither can exist apart\nfrom the other and each requires the other. The primordial nature is\nGod\u2019s envisagement of all possibilities; in the idiom of\nLeibniz, it is God\u2019s knowledge of all possible worlds. It is\ncalled \u201cprimordial\u201d because it represents what could\nbe in a sense not tethered to the actual course of events. It is\nlogical space, deficient in actuality apart from the consequent nature\nsays Whitehead. The consequent nature is God\u2019s prehensions of\nthe actual processes of the world. Conversely, it is the world\u2019s\ninfluence on God. It is called \u201cconsequent\u201d because it is\nconsequent upon, or dependent upon, the decisions of non-divine actual\nentities (Whitehead calls them actual occasions). The consequent\nnature is the record of all achieved fact, a perfect memory of what\nhas been\u2014Whitehead speaks of the \u201cobjective\nimmortality\u201d of the world in God. The two natures work in\nconcert in the process of God\u2019s interaction with the creatures.\nThe deity receives the world of actual occasions into its experience;\nthen, comparing what has actually occurred with the realm of pure\npossibility, God informs the world with new ideals (new aims),\ncustomized for each actual entity, for what realistically could be\nachieved. Whitehead sometimes refers to this aspect of the process as\nthe superjective nature of God. It is God\u2019s\nrelevance for the world as a \u201clure for feeling,\u201d urging\nthe creatures to strive for whatever perfection of which they are\ncapable.\n\nEach of the statements in Whitehead\u2019s \u201clitany\u201d can\nbe interpreted in terms of the interaction between the two natures and\nGod\u2019s interaction with the world. God is permanent in the sense\nof everlastingly envisioning the realm of possibility; the world is\npermanent as objectively immortal in God\u2019s memory. God is fluent\nin constantly acquiring new experiences of the world and the world is\nfluent in the rhythm of the birth and death of actual occasions. God\nis one in being a single actual entity; but God is many in the graded\nrelevance of possibilities provided for each emergent occasion. The\nworld is one in virtue of God\u2019s experience of it; the world is\nmany because of the plurality of occasions that make it up. God is\neminently actual in comparison to the world by achieving a unification\nof worldly occasions in the consequent nature that is beyond any of\nthem taken singly; but the world is eminently actual in comparison to\nGod\u2019s primordial nature, which is not concrete, although it is\nas infinite as the entire range of possibility. God and the world are\nimmanent in each other in that each experiences the other; yet God and\nthe world transcend each other by being realities whose experiences\nare not entirely determined by the other. Finally, as we have seen,\nGod creates the world by informing it with possibilities (technically\nspeaking, God provides \u201cinitial aims\u201d for every nascent\noccasion). The world creates God, not by bringing God into existence,\nbut by creating something in God, namely the material for what shall\nbecome objectively immortal.\n4.2 Hartshorne on existence and actuality\n\nHartshorne develops the concept of dual transcendence by drawing a\ndistinction of logical type between, on the one hand, an\nindividual\u2019s existence and enduring characteristics and, on the\nother hand, the actual states of the individual. Using an example dear\nto his ornithological interests, Hartshorne says, \u201cThat I shall\n(at least probably) exist tomorrow is one thing; that I shall exist\nhearing a blue jay call at noon is another\u201d (Hartshorne 1962,\n63). The logical relationship between the two sentences \u201cI shall\nexist tomorrow\u201d and \u201cI shall exist tomorrow as hearing a\nblue jay call at noon\u201d is that the second cannot be inferred\nfrom the first, but the first can be inferred from the second. The\nrelation of entailment between the sentences is a function of the\ninformation provided in them. Both sentences speak of the\nindividual\u2019s existence, but only the second sentence speaks of\nthe experience that the individual is having. Hartshorne argues that\nthis logical relation between the sentences reflects an ontological\ndifference between the bare fact of one\u2019s existence and the\nactual states in which one exists. Existence, says Hartshorne, is\nabstract compared to actuality, which is the concrete. What is true of\nexistence is also true of one\u2019s defining or enduring\ncharacteristics. The state of affairs described by \u201cHartshorne\nexisting as an ornithologist\u201d is abstract compared to the state\nof affairs described by \u201cHartshorne existing as an ornithologist\nhearing a blue jay call at noon.\u201d The more abstract statement\nleaves more details concerning the individual\u2019s actuality to be\ndefined. Unless strict determinism is the case\u2014which would\nrequire that there is only one future that is genuinely\npossible\u2014the ornithologist can exist tomorrow without hearing a\nblue jay call at noon (perhaps he will hear another bird, or none at\nall).\n\nIn effect, Hartshorne lays out a three-fold distinction between\nwhat a thing is (its essence or defining characteristics),\nthat a thing is (its existence), and the particular\nmanner in which it exists (its actual states or actuality).\nHartshorne maintains that this distinction, familiar enough in\nordinary experience, is applicable to God and is the basis for\nspeaking of dual transcendence in deity. Between the cases of God and\nthe creatures, however, there are important differences. Human\nexistence and character are fragile and subject to variation.\nGod\u2019s existence and character, on the other hand, are not\ninsecure, unstable, or transient; in a word, they are not contingent.\nHartshorne agrees with traditional theism that God exists without the\npossibility of not existing (sometimes called necessary existence or\nexistence a se) and that God is necessarily supreme in love,\nknowledge, and power. A closely related point is that, in the divine\ncase, existence and essence are identical, whereas they are not the\nsame thing in the creatures. Aquinas speaks of the \u201cexistential\ncomposition\u201d of the creatures to indicate that no creature\nnecessarily exists. Hartshorne agrees with Aquinas about this. Since,\nin God, existence and essence are the same, Hartshorne customarily\nabbreviates the distinction among existence, essence, and actuality to\nthat between existence and actuality.\n\nThe importance of the distinction between existence and actuality is\nto demonstrate that the necessary aspects of deity do not preclude God\nhaving contingent aspects, provided they do not conflict with the\nnecessary ones. We saw previously, in the discussion of real\nrelations, that there must be contingent aspects of the divine being\nif it is to have perfect knowledge of contingent things. Aquinas\nresists this conclusion, in part, because he sees contingency as a\nkind of metaphysical virus that infects the very existence of the one\nof which it is a characteristic. He says that a being whose substance\nhas any admixture of potency is subject to decay (as in physical\ncreatures) or annihilation (as in the case of angels) (Summa\nContra Gentiles I, ch. 16, para. 2). The logical type distinction\nbetween existence and actuality ensures that contingencies in God pose\nno threat to the deity\u2019s necessary existence. Thus, Hartshorne\nsays, \u201cThat God exists is one with his essence and is an\nanalytic truth \u2026 but how, or in what actual state of experience\nor knowledge or will, he exists is contingent in the same sense as is\nour own existence\u201d (Hartshorne 1948, 87). It is also part of\nHartshorne\u2019s theory that God\u2019s character or essence is\nsupremely excellent. Thus, the contingencies in the divine actuality\ndo not include the possibilities of God being selfish, cruel, or\nwicked as they do in the human case.\n\nThe mention of angelic existence in the previous paragraph brings up a\npoint seldom noticed in discussions of process theism. Aquinas\napproximates the Hartshornean distinction between immutable existence\nand mutable actuality in what he says about the nature of angels.\n(Thomists might say that Hartshorne approximates Aquinas.) Aquinas\nholds that angels are not subject to natural decay or destruction for\nthey are incorporeal. Like God, their existence is not affected by the\nflow of time. They are, however, capable of certain kinds of change.\nWhile their existence is constant, they have free will and their\nknowledge can increase, and in a certain sense, they can move from\nplace to place. Aquinas says that between the unqualified\nchangelessness of God\u2019s eternity and the qualified\nchangeableness of corporeal existence, there is the qualified\nimmutability of angelic being. The technical expression for this is\n\u00e6viternity, which is the mean between the extremes of\neternity and time (Summa Theologica I, Q 19, a. 5). One is\nalmost tempted to say that God, as conceived by Hartshorne, is\n\u00e6viternital, except for three important differences:\n(1) angelic existence is unaffected by time, but it is still\ncontingent, unlike the existence of Hartshorne\u2019s God; (2)\nangelic freedom includes the freedom to be wicked and Hartshorne does\nnot view that as an option for God; (3) angels are entirely\nnonphysical, but Hartshorne argues, as we shall see, that God has a\nbody of sorts in the universe itself.\n\nHartshorne often refers to his theism as \u201cneoclassical\u201d to\nindicate both its affinities with and its departures from classical\ntheism\u2014it retains much of what is \u201cclassical\u201d in\nclassical theism, but adds something that is new (neo).\nClassical theism holds to the necessity, eternity, infinity,\nindependence, immutability, and impassibility of God. Hartshorne\nagrees that God can be so characterized, but only with respect to the\ndivine existence and essence. Hartshorne adds that\nGod\u2019s actuality is contingent, temporal, finite,\ndependent, mutable, and passible. Indeed, Hartshorne agrees with\nWhitehead that all achieved value is necessarily finite in\nthe sense of not exhausting all that can be. Whitehead makes the point\nthat the limitation of God is a necessary condition of God\u2019s\ngoodness.\n\n[God] gains his depth of actuality by his harmony of valuation. It is\nnot true that God is in all respects infinite. If He were, He would be\nevil as well as good. Also this unlimited fusion of evil with good\nwould mean mere nothingness. He is something decided and is thereby\nlimited. (Whitehead 1926 [1997, 153])\n\n\nIt is noteworthy that Whitehead does not say that God is not infinite,\nbut that God is not infinite in all respects. Thus, dual\ntranscendence does not entail that God is in no sense infinite.\nHartshorne locates the infinity of God primarily in the unlimited\ncapacity to influence, know, and care for the creatures in any\nconceivable world.\n\nOne may rightly demand an answer to the question: If God is finite in\nsome respects, what prevents there being a reality that surpasses God?\nHartshorne\u2019s response is that there is indeed a possible reality\nthat surpasses God in any actual state of the divine existence, but\nwhat can surpass God is only a subsequent actual state of Godself.\nHartshorne calls on Gustav Fechner\u2019s distinction between\n\u201csurpassable by others, including self\u201d and\n\u201csurpassable, but only by self.\u201d It is only the latter\nphrase, according to Hartshorne, that applies to God. This is what\nHartshorne calls R-perfection (for relative perfection), a form of\nperfection that permits a contingent actuality in God that is\nunsurpassed by all others, excluding self. This is by way of\ncontrast with A-perfection (for absolute perfection)\u2014which\napplies to the divine existence and essence\u2014which is to be\nunsurpassable by all others, including self. To speak of God\nas having dual transcendence is to say that God is both R-perfect and\nA-perfect, but in different respects. Thus, one of Hartshorne\u2019s\npreferred definitions of God: \u201cthe self-surpassing surpasser of\nall\u201d (Hartshorne 1948, 20).\n\nHartshorne\u2019s version of dual transcendence is quite different\nfrom Whitehead\u2019s. To be sure, Whitehead and Hartshorne are in\nfirm agreement, and are at pains to emphasize, that the relations\nbetween God and the world are symmetrical. In addition, both\nphilosophers regard God as supremely worshipful not only with respect\nto the divine absoluteness but also with respect to the divine\nrelativity. Indeed, one of the main objectives of Hartshorne\u2019s\nbook The Divine Relativity (1948) is to show that only by\nhaving an eminent form of relativity can the deity qualify as\nworshipful. Nevertheless, Hartshorne conceives God as an individual\nwho endures through various actual states. In the technical language\nof Whitehead\u2019s philosophy, this makes God a\n\u201csociety,\u201d that is to say, a collection of actual entities\nextended in time, each member of which shares a defining\ncharacteristic, passed along from one moment to the next. All enduring\nobjects are societies of actual entities; moreover, no actual entity\nendures through various states. Whitehead\u2019s God is not\nan enduring object but a single actual entity. To speak of\nWhitehead\u2019s God as dipolar is to indicate that God has a\nphysical and a mental pole. This sense of \u201cdipolar\u201d is\ndifferent from the meaning that Hartshorne commonly gives the\nexpression. Hartshorne does not deny that actual entities are dipolar,\nnor does he deny that there are physical and mental aspects of deity,\nbut his God is dipolar in having an enduring character embodied in\nsuccessive states, the character being abstract compared to the\nconcrete actual states\u2014this gives us a third meaning of\n\u201cdipolar\u201d (cf. Griffin\u2019s rather different view on\nthe meanings of dipolarity in God, Griffin 2001a, 150). Hartshorne\nsays, \u201cUnlike Whitehead, I \u2026 define God as an enduring\nsociety of actualities, not a single actuality. Here I think Whitehead\nwas just mistaken\u201d (Hartshorne 1967b, 287).\n\nWhitehead indicated that he considered the possibility of God being an\nenduring object, and thus a society, but rejected it on the grounds\nthat God\u2019s consequent nature loses nothing of the past whereas\nsocieties are characterized by partial loss of the past (Johnson 1983,\n9). This argument is curious, for it would seem to apply to actual\nentities as well as to societies. No non-divine actual entity\npreserves its entire past without distortion and loss; yet Whitehead\nattributes to deity\u2014in the doctrine of objective immortality of\nthe past in God\u2014what no other actual entity can accomplish. In\nreply to a question from Vergilius Ferm, Hartshorne notes that the\nunique excellence of retaining the past perfectly in memory must be no\nless true if God is an actual entity than if God is a society (Rome\n1964, 324). He argues that the consequent nature of God is itself\nabstract, for it is the generic property of being somehow\nactual or affected by others (Hartshorne 1972, 75\u201376).\nThus, Hartshorne proposes that Whitehead would be more true to his own\nmetaphysics by conceiving God as an enduring object, and thus as a\nsociety, rather than as a single actual entity. Hartshorne\nacknowledged that his own theory is not without its problems. Not\nleast of these is how to coordinate the concept of a divine temporal\nworld-line with the relativistic view of space-time in contemporary\nphysics (Hartshorne 1970, 123\u2013125; Sia 1990, 276; cf. Griffin\n1992). Suffice it to say that the question whether God is best\nconceived as a single actual entity or as an enduring object is a\nmajor parting of the ways between process theists. Griffin, for\nexample, refers to the idea of God as a single everlasting actual\nentity as Whitehead\u2019s \u201cgreatest blunder\u201d (Griffin\n2001a, 152). Nevertheless, Whitehead\u2019s view has a number of able\ndefenders, including Jorge Nobo and Palmyre Oomen (Nobo 1989; Oomen\n1998).\n5. Panentheism\n\nThe doctrine of prehension, developed by Whitehead but also\nenthusiastically endorsed by Hartshorne, insures that the world is,\nin some sense, part of God. Actual entities, by virtue of\ntheir prehensions of one another, are internally related to their\npredecessors and externally related to their successors.\nWhitehead\u2019s \u201corganic\u201d philosophy can thereby affirm\nboth that an individual is in the world and the world is\nin the individual. This generalization applies equally to\nGod, but with differences that allow for a clear distinction between\nthe divine and the non-divine. Whitehead maintains that events in the\nworld have a specific locus with reference to God, but God has no\nlocus with reference to the world (Johnson 1983, 9). Hartshorne says\nthat God is the one individual conceivable a priori\u2014God\nis individuated by, though not exhausted by, concepts alone\n(Hartshorne 1948, 31). This is because God\u2019s scope of\ninteraction is universal whereas the scope of interaction for any\ncreature is localized. To be God is to causally affect and be affected\nby every real being; to be a non-divine entity is to causally\naffect and be affected by some, but not all, creatures.\nWhitehead and Hartshorne also say that God and the creatures differ in\nthe quality of interaction. For example, any non-divine\nindividual\u2019s knowledge of others is imperfect and partial\nwhereas God\u2019s knowledge is without defect (Hartshorne 1967,\n40).\n\nWhile both philosophers deny that God has location within the\nuniverse, they consider God to be in some sense a physical or\nmaterial being. Since process thought affirms the goodness of God, it\nis clear that it denies the ancient Manichean and Gnostic ideas that\nthere is something inherently evil in being material. Even so, in\norder to fully appreciate the process view, it is well to keep in mind\nthat Whitehead and Hartshorne reject the traditional concept of matter\nas devoid of any activity or feeling\u2014Whitehead refers to the\ntraditional view of matter as \u201cvacuous actuality.\u201d Because\nactual entities are dipolar, all of them have a physical aspect, but\nnone are entirely lacking in psychic qualities, although in most cases\nthese qualities are negligible. Thus, in process thought, being\nphysical does not mean having no mind-like qualities. The closest\nanticipation of process ideas about mind and body are in Leibniz,\nalthough process thought denies Leibniz\u2019s view that the monads\nhave no \u201cwindows.\u201d Leibniz maintains that no monad enters\ninto the internal constitution of another; Whitehead\u2019s doctrine\nof prehension insures that actual entities are internally related to\ntheir predecessors.\n\nA common criticism of process theism is that it conceives God as\n\u201cneeding\u201d the world. In one sense this is true, but in\nanother sense it is false. It is true that, in process metaphysics,\nthe structure of reality is social, and necessarily so. Thus, it\npromotes a social view of God\u2014God as necessarily related to\nnon-divine actualities. On the other hand, the process God does not\nrequire any particular universe in order to exist. Whitehead speaks of\na succession of \u201ccosmic epochs\u201d which are, in effect,\ndifferent universes where the very laws of nature are different. God\npresides over each universe as its eminent creative power, making\npossible all localized expressions of creativity, but no universe\nsustains God\u2019s existence. Hartshorne makes a similar point by\ncomparing God\u2019s existence and actuality to a set that\nnecessarily has members. \u201cTo say that a class could not be empty\nis not at all to say that its particular members are necessary\u201d\n(Hartshorne 1970, 144). From the perspective of process theism, the\ncriticism that God \u201cneeds\u201d the universe is, at best,\nsimply another way of raising the question of how best to conceive the\nnecessarily existent: Is it, or is it not, social in nature?\n\nTrinitarians sometimes argue that a social concept of ultimate reality\ncan be formulated if God is necessarily related to the divine self.\nProcess theists, especially those who are Christians, are not averse\nto this suggestion. Nevertheless, if this is to be taken seriously as\na philosophical proposal, then there can be no mere appeal to the\n\u201cmystery\u201d of the Trinity. Some effort should be made to\nretain the primary meaning of \u201csocial\u201d as multiple\nentities in a network of relations, some of which are internal and\nsome external. That is to say, a genuinely social concept of reality\nis one in which the multiple identities of each of the interrelated\nand interacting entities are not absorbed into each other. Whitehead\nand Hartshorne claim to do this apart from the Christian doctrine of\nthe Trinity, but there is no reason a priori to suppose that\nTrinitarian metaphysics cannot be one version of process metaphysics,\nor that the latter could not be adapted to the former (Boyd 1992;\nInbody 1997, ch. 8; Bracken and Suchocki 2005).\n\nWhitehead and Hartshorne part company concerning the proper analogy\nfor conceiving the God-world relation. Hartshorne modifies\nPlato\u2019s world-soul analogy in the Timaeus\n(30a\u201334c). In Plato\u2019s myth, the eternal demiurge creates a\nuniverse that is a living creature, animated by a soul. Hartshorne\nargues that the best philosophical interpretation of the myth is to\nconsider the demiurge and the world-soul as two aspects of the same\ndeity (Hartshorne & Reese 1953 [2000, 55]). If this is correct, then\nPlato affirms a version of dual transcendence, with one aspect of God\nbeing the universe. According to this interpretation, Plato came close\nto Hartshorne\u2019s view that, \u201cthe world is God\u2019s\nbody\u201d (Hartshorne 1941, 185; Dombrowski 2005, chapter 1). This\nis not to say that God has a location within the universe, but that\nthe location of the universe is in God, for the divine\nbeing-in-becoming is all-inclusive. Hartshorne borrows a word invented\nby Karl Krause (1781\u20131832) to express this view:\npanentheism\u2014everything (pan, all) is in\n(en, in) God (theos, God) (Cooper 2006, 121).\nPanentheism is a mediating position between pantheism and classical\ntheism. For pantheism, the world is identical to God; for classical\ntheism, the world is completely external to God; for panentheism, the\nworld is within God.\n\nHartshorne makes qualifications to Plato\u2019s analogy. Whereas\nPlato apparently conceives the soul-body (or mind-body) relationship\nas a one-to-one relation, Hartshorne, following modern biology, argues\nthat it is more plausible to construe it as a one-to-many relation.\nThe human body is a hierarchical society of thousands of kinds of\ncells. Thus, Hartshorne maintains that God is related to the universe\nin a manner similar to the way that a person is related to the cells\nof his or her body. In an important respect, Whitehead can make a\nbetter claim than Hartshorne that the relationship of God to the World\nis one-to-many. Whitehead\u2019s God is a single actual entity\nwhereas Hartshorne\u2019s God is a society. Thus, if it is a question\nof the relations of actual entities, then the God-to-World relation in\nHartshorne\u2019s theism is a many-to-many relation.\nHartshorne\u2019s point requires clarification: God, a single\nenduring object, is related to every non-divine actual entity and\nsociety. Clarity on this point brings out another comparison. By\nconceiving God as an actual entity, Whitehead weakens the analogy\nbetween God and a person. Donald Sherburne shows that in\nWhitehead\u2019s metaphysics, persons are enduring objects of a\nspecific type (Sherburne 1969). Therefore, Hartshorne\u2019s view of\nGod as an enduring object apparently provides more of a basis for\nspeaking of God as a person.\n\nRandall E. Auxier and Gary L. Herstein (2017) maintain, on the\ncontrary, that a Whiteheadian view is friendlier to conceiving God as\na person than Hartshorne\u2019s view. Their argument turns on the\nidea of negative prehensions, that is, experience which\n\u201celiminates [certain data] from feeling\u201d (Whitehead 1929 [1978,\n23]). According to Auxier and Herstein, one cannot be a person or\nexperience temporal passage apart from negative prehensions, which,\nthey say, allow distinctions both between what was and what\nmight-have-been and between what will-be and what\nmight-be (Auxier and Herstein 2017, 243 and 265). Hartshorne\nconsistently rejected the idea of negative prehensions in God whereas\nWhitehead, at least in some of his statements, seemed to allow for\nthem. The metaphysical issues run deep; suffice it to say that\nHartshorne distinguished the actual and the possible in ways that\ndiverged significantly from Whitehead (see Ramal 2010,\n139\u2013157).\n\nTo speak of God as a person is, of course, an analogy. A\nperson\u2019s feelings cannot be entirely separated from the feelings\nof cells in the body\u2014damage to the cells hurts the person. In a\nsimilar fashion, God is affected by what affects the creatures. On the\nother hand, God knows\u2014in Whiteheadian language, God\nprehends\u2014each \u201ccell\u201d of the divine body in a\nperfectly distinct fashion whereas others experience their cells\nen masse, much as one sees the green of the grass but not\neach blade. Another difference, as we have seen, is that God is not\nlocated within the universe as are non-divine individuals. Hartshorne\nturns this difference to his advantage by following a suggestion in\nPlato. He says that Plato\u2019s argument concerning the spherical\nnature of the universe adequately explains why the divine body has\nneither internal organs nor sense organs. Bodily organs in the\ncreatures, including a central nervous system, are needed to mediate\nwith an external environment, but there is nothing external to the\nuniverse (Hartshorne 1984, 134). God\u2019s only\n\u201cenvironment\u201d is internal to God. Thus, the world-soul\nanalogy does not entail that God has a brain or any other bodily organ\nthat one finds in the creatures. In addition, the lack of an external\nenvironment for God means that there can be no threat to the divine\nexistence from such a source. The \u201charm\u201d done to God by\ncreaturely suffering can never be fatal.\n\nWhitehead\u2019s view of God as a single actual entity is arguably\none factor that prevented him from taking the Platonic analogy as a\nserious proposal. His remarks on the topic are entirely negative. He\ncalled the Timaeus Plato\u2019s \u201cmost unfortunate essay\nin mythology,\u201d and he referred to the idea of the World-Soul,\nconsidered as an emanation, as \u201cthe parent of puerile\nmetaphysics\u201d (Whitehead 1933, 166; ch. VIII, sec. VI). Whitehead\nread the dialogue through the lens of neo-Platonism, conceiving the\nworld-soul as an emanation from a wholly transcendent demiurge.\nHartshorne agrees that this is not the solution to the problem of\npermanence and flux. However, Hartshorne sees in Plato\u2019s myth\nthe elements of a solution, provided the demiurge and the world-soul\nare not separate deities, but aspects of the same deity. For this\nreason, Hartshorne says that Whitehead rejected the analogy for\n\u201cweak reasons\u201d (Hahn 1991, 642).\n\nLate in his career, Hartshorne saw other advantages to the world-soul\nanalogy that touch on the problem of God and gender. He was\nsympathetic to feminist complaints about the male bias in traditional\ntheology and he made a concerted effort in the closing decades of his\nlife to use inclusive language (Hartshorne 1987 [2001, 258]). For example, in\nthe 1980s he began using \u201cHe-She\u201d when referring to God\nand he remarked in 1996 that he would title his third book Our\nVision of God rather than Man\u2019s Vision of God\n(Auxier and Davies 2001, 159). Hartshorne goes further than simply\nworrying about pronouns. If the world-soul analogy is combined with\nthe parent-to-child analogy, then he argues that, \u201cit is the\nmother, not the father, who furnishes by far the best symbol of deity.\nThe fetus-mother relationship is decidedly more intimate than the\nfetus-father relationship\u201d (Hartshorne 1984, 60). Hartshorne\nnever expressed his thoughts on feminism systematically, but it is\ninstructive that Carol P. Christ explicitly develops her feminist\nphilosophy of religion in light of Hartshorne\u2019s metaphysics in\nher book She Who Changes. Generally speaking, feminist\ntheologians have been friendly to process thought, seeing Whitehead\nand Hartshorne as articulating ideas about the divine that speak to\nfeminist concerns (Christ 2003, 4\u20135).\n\nOne objection to the concept of a deity whose \u201cbody\u201d is\nthe universe is that it implies that all values, both the good and the\nevil, are within God. Hartshorne counters that this is true, but not\nin a sense that compromises divine goodness. As a point of logic,\nwholes do not necessarily share the characteristics of their parts. On\nHartshorne\u2019s model, the relation of God to any non-divine\ncreature is a relation of whole to part. Indeed, this is the basis of\nHartshorne\u2019s view of religion as the acceptance of our\nfragmentariness\u2014we are fragments of the cosmos, not the whole of\nit. Thus, Hartshorne can say that God\u2019s goodness is not\ndiminished if a fragmentary being is heedless of the good of others,\nby indifference or harmful intent. Nevertheless, precisely because\nof God\u2019s goodness, the suffering and wickedness of the\ncreatures enter God\u2019s experience. God sympathizes with the\nsufferer and grieves for the criminal in losing an opportunity for\ncreating the good. God can feel the contrast between what could have\nbeen and what is. The \u201cwhat is,\u201d moreover, is not\nunilaterally determined by God but is left, in part, to the creatures;\nwe have seen that God and the creatures are co-creators in process\ntheism. For this reason, Hartshorne, following Berdyaev, speaks of\ntragic and sublime aspects of divine love (cf. Hartshorne 1953,\nchapter 8). Whitehead agrees that, \u201cthere is a tragedy which\neven God does not escape\u201d (Johnson 1983, 7).\n6. Divine Power and the Problem of Evil\n\nProcess theism provides unique, if controversial, thoughts on the\ntraditional problem of evil. Simply stated, the problem of evil comes\nto this: if God is all-powerful then God has the ability to prevent\nunjustified suffering; if God is perfectly good then God has the\nmotive to prevent unjustified suffering; but unjustified suffering\napparently exists; therefore, there is reason to believe that God is\nnot all-powerful or not perfectly good. The argument can be taken in\nat least two ways. According to one interpretation, the problem of\nevil poses a challenge to belief in God. In other words, it is a\nstepping stone towards atheism. Another interpretation is that it is a\nchallenge to rethink the attributes of God. In this case, if one\nconsiders the argument sound, it is not belief in God that one should\nabandon, but belief in certain concepts of God. Process theists\ngenerally approach the problem of evil in the spirit of the second\ninterpretation. Moreover, they point out that to assume the first\ninterpretation\u2014that the problem of evil is an argument against\nthe existence of God\u2014is an invitation to beg the question\nagainst alternative proposals about the nature of God such as process\ntheism offers.\n\nA central contention of process theism is that the problem of evil is\naggravated by flawed accounts of omnipotence commonly assumed by\ntheists and their critics. Most theists agree with Aquinas that God\ncannot bring about logically impossible states of affairs, like\ncreating a circle with unequal radii (Summa Contra Gentiles\nII, ch. 25, para. 14). This is not, Aquinas argues, a limitation on\nGod but a condition of responsible theological discourse. To say, as\nDescartes does, that God could have made such irregularly shaped\ncircles, is to utter nonsense according to Aquinas (Cottingham 1991,\n25). Whitehead remarks that some medieval and modern philosophers got\ninto the unfortunate habit of paying God \u201cmetaphysical\ncompliments\u201d\u2014that is to say, attributing properties to God\nthat seem to make the divine more worthy of devotion but that are\ncontrary to sound metaphysical reasoning (Whitehead 1925, 258).\nWhitehead\u2019s observation is more applicable to Descartes than to\nAquinas. Indeed, process theism has no quarrel with Aquinas on this\npoint. It is rather, the stronger claim that God can bring about any\nstate of affairs the description of which is not contradictory, with\nwhich process theism takes issue. It is a fair question whether\nAquinas held this view (see Summa Theologica I, Q. 25, a. 3).\nNevertheless, it is a widely accepted view of omnipotence as Griffin\nmakes clear (Griffin 1976, chapter 17). In a deliberate play on J. B.\nPhillips\u2019 classic, Your God is Too Small, Tyron Inbody\nsums up the criticism of traditional accounts of divine power by\nsaying, \u201cYour God is too big\u201d (Inbody 1997, 139).\n\nGriffin warns against what he calls \u201cthe omnipotence\nfallacy.\u201d This is the fallacy of assuming that if a state of\naffairs is logically possible\u2014that is, its description involves\nno contradiction\u2014then an omnipotent being could single-handedly\nbring it about (Griffin 1976, 263f). Griffin represents all process\ntheists in considering it a fallacy, for it is their contention that\nthere are logically possible states of affairs that no being,\nincluding God, could bring about by itself. For example, a contractual\nagreement between two individuals or parties is impossible unless each\nagrees to keep the conditions of the contract. This is expressed\ncolloquially in English by saying, \u201cIt takes two to\ntango.\u201d The example of making contracts is especially relevant\nsince it is a theme in Jewish Scripture that God enters into numerous\ncovenants with the creatures. The emphasis is invariably on the divine\ninitiative in making the covenants and on God\u2019s reliability in\nkeeping a promise; nevertheless, when \u201ccovenant\u201d is not\nsimply shorthand for God\u2019s promises, the agreements are\ntwo-sided affairs, including God\u2019s blessings and demands and\nhuman obligations. Arguably, the logic of contracts, agreements, and\ncovenants, does not change when one of the parties is divine. These\nexamples are evidence that there are logically possible states of\naffairs that require something more than the decisions of God.\n\nHartshorne argues the case as follows. Suppose X and\nY are agents who make decisions A and B,\nrespectively. The conjunction, AB, is something that neither\nX nor Y, individually, decided, even if one of\nthe agents is God. Suppose, however, for the sake of argument,\nthat this reasoning does not apply in the divine case. According to\nthis view, if X is God, then it is possible for X to\ndecide not only A, but also AB. We can imagine that\nA represents God loving an individual and B\nrepresents the individual freely accepting God\u2019s love. If God\ndecides AB then God must also bring it about that B,\nthat the individual freely accepts God\u2019s love, for this is part\nof AB. Hartshorne responds that this view divorces the\nconcept of decision making from any meaningful connection with lived\nexperience. Numerous analogies have been discussed in the literature\nfor how free creatures might be related to a deity that makes their\ndecisions\u2014the creatures as God\u2019s marionettes; as androids\nprogrammed by God; as subjects hypnotized by God; as objects of\nGod\u2019s dreaming; as characters in God\u2019s novel. Each analogy\nfaces the dilemma that either the decisions of the person are not\nfully determined (e.g., the hypnotism case) or the person is not an\nactual individual (e.g., the fictional character case). In ordinary\nlanguage, an individual that tries to control a relationship is called\nmanipulative, overbearing, or colloquially, \u201ca control\nfreak.\u201d Doubtless, it was considering this kind of analogy that\nled Hartshorne to speak of \u201cthe tyrant ideal of\npower\u201d in classical theism (Hartshorne 1984a, 11). In a similar\nvein, Whitehead speaks of the idolatry of fashioning God in the image\nof imperial rulers: \u201cThe Church gave unto God the attributes\nwhich belonged exclusively to Caesar\u201d (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 342]).\n\nJames Keller argues that the traditional concept of omnipotence can\nonly be justified by appealing to metaphysical schemes or intuitions\nthat are no better established than omnipotence itself (Keller 2007,\n131). Hartshorne goes further and says that the traditional concept of\nomnipotence was not coherent enough to be false (Hartshorne 1978, 86).\nThe denial that an individual\u2019s free decisions can be totally\ndetermined by another is what is behind the slogan\u2014often found\nin discussions of process theism\u2014that God acts by persuasion\nrather than by coercion. Whitehead attributes this idea to\nPlato\u2019s later thought, in the Sophist and the\nTimaeus, and calls it, \u201cone of the greatest\nintellectual discoveries in the history of religion\u201d (Whitehead\n1933, 213; ch. X, sec. III). Unfortunately, the slogan has often been\nmisinterpreted, even by process thinkers. It does not mean that,\naccording to Whitehead and Hartshorne, God acts only as a final cause\nand never as an efficient cause, as Griffin has shown (Griffin 1991,\n98\u201399). \u201cCoercion,\u201d in the sense intended by the\nslogan, is the ability of one actual being to unilaterally bring about\nthe decision of another actual being. In process metaphysics, no\nindividual possesses this ability. Thus, in a metaphysical sense, it\nis not only God that acts persuasively and not coercively, but every\nactual being.\n\nOf course, \u201cpersuasion\u201d and \u201ccoercion\u201d have\nmeanings in ordinary language. To persuade is to convince others to do\nsomething of their own will. To coerce is to force\none\u2019s will upon others who are unwilling. The\nitalicized phrases are important, for they demonstrate that persuasion\nand coercion presuppose the ability of the individual who is being\npersuaded or coerced to make decisions. Even in the case of coercion,\nthe person being coerced retains the power to resist, even if only\nmentally. This indicates that coercion is an inferior form of power,\nused either out of ignorance or when persuasion has failed. Cobb says,\n\u201cIn my relations with other people, such as my children, the use\nof such power is a last resort which expresses my total powerlessness\nin all ways that matter\u201d (Cobb 1969, 89). Thus, even if the\nwords \u201cpersuasive\u201d and \u201ccoercive\u201d are taken in\ntheir ordinary, non-metaphysical, senses, it makes sense to speak of\nthe supreme or eminent form of power as persuasive rather than\ncoercive.\n\nDavid Basinger presses the following objection. Coercion in the\nordinary sense may be an inferior form of power, but there is\nsometimes a moral imperative to use it, otherwise we would never have\na police force. Thus, a deity that possesses both coercive and\npersuasive power is greater than a deity that possesses only\npersuasive power (Basinger 1988). Hartshorne, who argues against\nstrict pacifism, agrees that the use of brute force can sometimes be\nmorally justified. In response to the threat of Naziism he wrote,\n\u201cFreedom must not be free to destroy freedom\u201d (Hartshorne\n1941, 173). In process theism, however, coercion in the ordinary sense\nrepresents an indirect form of power that is available only\nfor localized beings within the cosmos (Hartshorne 1948, 155). It is\nindirect in the sense that it is exerted on aggregates of actual\nentities and not on actual entities themselves, as when one person\nprevents another from performing a vicious act by restraining the\naggressor\u2019s body. God\u2019s power over aggregates is nothing\nover and above the direct persuasive power over the actual entities\nthat comprise them. Barry Whitney argues that there is a coercive\naspect of God\u2019s power in process theism insofar as the laws of\nnature are the result of a divine decision that no creature is free to\nabrogate (Whitney 1985, 99\u2013114). That there should be this form\nof divine power\u2014which is also a form of efficient\ncausation\u2014providing for an ordered world that no creature has\ndecided, is a necessary condition for any creaturely activity,\nHartshorne believes. \u201cGod decides upon the basic outlines of\ncreaturely actions, and guaranteed limits within which freedom is to\noperate. That not everything can be guaranteed does not mean that\nnothing can be\u201d (Hartshorne 1966, 206).\n\nGriffin maintains that it lies at the heart of process theism\u2019s\nanswer to the problem of evil that God\u2019s power is exerted on\nindividuals rather than aggregates (Griffin 1991, 104). Theists of a\nmore traditional bent may view this as an indication of the inadequacy\nof process metaphysics, for there is no provision for a\nrun-of-the-mill coercive power in its concept of God. The idea that\npersuasion plus coercion is a greater form of power than persuasion\nalone ignores, however, a significant difference between God and the\ncreatures. Every person has the power of persuasion and coercion (in\ntheir ordinary senses), but neither of these powers involves a\nviolation of the laws of nature. In order to attribute both forms of\npower to God seems to require that God have the power to violate the\nlaws of nature. That may not seem unreasonable since God, as\ntraditionally conceived, acts miraculously in ways that break or\nsuspend the laws of nature. Nevertheless, to speak, as Basinger does,\nof a moral imperative to act coercively is tantamount, in the divine\ncase, to demanding that the deity contravene the very laws that,\naccording to traditional theism and process theism, it imposed in the\nfirst place. There is an additional irony where the problem of evil is\nconcerned. Traditional theists fault process theists for, in effect,\nnot attributing to God the power to prevent gratuitous suffering.\nTraditional theists, on the other hand, attribute this power to God\nbut are obliged to argue that God is not at fault for not using it or\nfor using it in ways that we find utterly baffling.\n\nA hallmark of process theism is to draw attention to the value\ninherent in the twin probabilities of genuine good and evil.\nProcess thought raises the question\u2014and answers it in the\naffirmative\u2014whether a world with a probability, not merely a\npossibility, of genuine good and evil is preferable to a world without\nit. In the closing pages of Pragmatism, James raises this\nquestion by means of a thought experiment. If God asked you before the\ncreation of the universe if you would agree to be part of a world that\nwas not certain to be saved\u2014where there was real adventure and\nreal risk\u2014what would you say? James recognizes that a world\nwhere the risk of failure is real does not appeal to everyone; but he\nsays that the chances for success that it promises brings zest to life\nand makes it rational to, \u201cadd our fiat to the\nfiat of the creator\u201d (James 1907, 290\u2013291). In\nfairness, however, the freedom that makes life an adventure must be\njudged against the probabilities of debilitating diseases, natural\ndisasters, the horrors of history, and cosmic catastrophes. Freedom\nis, in Hartshorne\u2019s words, a \u201cperilous experiment.\u201d\nGeorge Shields called this \u201cthe hard problem\u201d of a\nspecifically process theodicy (2014, 33). And Hartshorne admitted that\nif he played at questioning God, it was at this point (1984, 126).\n\nHartshorne says that a universe with multiple freedom or creativity is\na universe where the non-identical twins of opportunity and risk are\ninevitable. As already noted, process theists do not believe in a God\nthat plays with loaded dice. What James\u2019s image adds to this\npicture is the idea that a world-order with the opportunity for\ngenuine good and the risk of genuine evil is of greater value\nthan a world-order devoid of these opportunities and risks.\nJames\u2019s idea also implies that, in such a world-order, the risks\nwould be real for deity. We have already seen that process theism\naffirms tragedy in God. The silver linings on this cloud are: (1) God\npreserves the universe in the divine memory which means that the\ncreatures contribute something to God; (2) God, considered as\nsuperject, has an inexhaustible capacity to bring order from chaos and\nmake fresh beginnings, providing a sense of hope amidst the ruin of\nour lives.\n\nThe problem of evil is often presented primarily as an ethical\nconcern, but there is an aesthetic dimension to the problem that is\nemphasized by process theism (cf. Whitney 1994). If a perfectly good\ndeity would have the motive to overcome discord and wickedness, it\nwould also have a motive to avoid triviality and boredom. This is\nespecially the case in the universe as conceived by process theism\nwhere feeling (prehension) is a metaphysical category. The etymology\nof \u201caesthetic\u201d is aesthesis, which means\n\u201cfeeling,\u201d and process thought emphasizes that aesthetic\nvalues are fundamentally values for an experiencing subject. Moreover,\nthe experiencing subject, in most cases, is not human. This fact is\nevident not only by looking at the contemporary world with its\ncountless varieties of species, but also when one considers the nearly\nunfathomable stretches of time on this planet when humans did not\nexist. Process theism takes the non-anthropocentric, and\nnon-relativist, stance that the experiences of non-human creatures are\nvaluable whether or not humans value them. This is not to say that all\nexperience is equally valuable\u2014the experience of a cockroach can\nhave value without being fully comparable to human experience. Process\nmetaphysics provides for an aesthetic theory that recognizes objective\ncriteria of value such as unity amid contrast and intensity amid\ncomplexity (see Dombrowksi 2004). The long process of evolution can be\ncharted on a curve of ever increasing varieties and complexities of\norganisms with augmented capacity for valuable types of experience. As\nCobb and Griffin note, the escape from triviality meant an increased\nrisk of discord, but this brings us full circle to James\u2019s\nthought experiment (Cobb and Griffin 1976, 73).\n7. Divine Knowledge and the Problem of Future Contingents\n\nThe Preacher in Ecclesiastes gives eloquent expression to\nworld-weariness by saying that there is nothing new under the sun.\nNevertheless, process thought reminds us that there was once a time\nwhen the sun itself was new. We noted earlier that in process\nmetaphysics, time is the process of creation. The universe is not a\ntotality, fixed once and for all, but a dynamic vector growing from a\ndeterminate past into an open (partly indeterminate) future. We have\nalso seen that process theism conceives God as being really related to\nthe world through prehensions or feelings. If divine knowing is\nconsidered perfect, then it follows from these premises that God knows\nthe past as fully determinate (as created), the present as the process\nof determination (as being created), and the future as partly\nindeterminate (as yet to be created). Some have criticized process\ntheism for advocating a limited God who is ignorant of the future.\nProcess theists reply that this is incorrect and represents a subtle\nbegging of the question. The question is not whether God knows a fully\ndeterminate future but whether there is a fully determinate future to\nknow. It is the nature of time, not the nature of divine knowing, that\nis at issue. If the future exists as partially indeterminate,\nunsettled, or uncreated, then a perfect knower must know it as\nsuch.\n\nThe fact that process theism construes God\u2019s knowledge as\nprehensive means that it is a mistake to interpret it solely in terms\nof the information content of declarative sentences. This is not to\nsay that God does not have this information, but it is well to keep in\nmind that omniscience, for process theism, is more akin to what\nBertrand Russell calls knowledge by acquaintance than it is to\nknowledge by description (Hartshorne 1941, 241). Divine prehensions of\nthe world include not only information but affective tone (Whitehead\ncalls it the \u201csubjective form\u201d of prehensions);\nGod\u2019s knowledge is empathetic, feeling the feelings of the\ncreatures. Again, this contrasts with the traditional account of\nomniscience which \u201cattributes to God the informational content\nof our perceptions without the hedonistic content\u201d (Kenny 1979,\n32). E. S. Brightman (Auxier and Davies 2001, 43, 70), Henri\nSimoni-Wastila (1999), and Auxier and Herstein (2017, 264) argue that\nclaiming this kind of knowledge for God is excessive, for it would\nmean, for example, that in knowing a creature\u2019s fear of death,\nGod would also fear death. Hartshorne\u2019s response is that God\nfeels how we feel without feeling as we feel,\nsimilar to the way in which persons can vividly remember emotions they\nonce experienced without actually having those emotions as their own\nin the present experience of memory (Hartshorne 1984b, 199). This\nissue highlights a tension between Whitehead and Hartshorne. Whitehead\nspeaks of an actual entity\u2019s subjectivity as\n\u201cperishing\u201d as it becomes past, but Hartshorne insists\nthat the divine memory preserves the immediacy of our experiences,\nmaking them objectively immortal (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 351]; Hartshorne\n1970, 118).\n\nProcess theism provides an account of the mechanics of\nomniscience\u2014that is, an account of how God knows the\nworld\u2014that fits well with analogies drawn from experience. Apart\nfrom complications introduced by quantum physics, events do not occur\nbecause we know about them; we know about them, in part, because they\noccur. Process theism applies the same logic to God. This account\ndiffers from traditional views in two important ways. First, many\ntheists follow Aquinas in reversing the cognitive relation in God. For\nAquinas, God knows events in the world because God is their cause\n(Summa Theologica I, Q. 14, a. 11). This allows Aquinas to\naffirm omniscience while denying real relations in God; however, it\nalso makes an unambiguous affirmation of the contingency of creaturely\ndecisions difficult if not impossible, as we have already seen in our\ndiscussion of God and creativity. Second, the process view contradicts\nthe Boethian concept of eternity as a non-temporal viewpoint on\ntemporal events. For Boethius (and for Aquinas) events in time are\nrelated to God as the points on the circumference of a circle are\nrelated to its center (Consolation of Philosophy, bk 5, prose\n6; Summa Contra Gentiles I, ch. 66, para. 7). For process\nthought, time is more like a line being added to from moment to\nmoment, but never complete, so there is no vantage from which it can\nbe taken in all at once (Hartshorne 1945, 284).\n\nThere are peculiarities in traditional metaphors for omniscience that\nprocess thought rejects. God, it was said, \u201csees\u201d all of\ntime in one eternal instant; yet seeing, like knowing, requires real\nrelations in the perceiver; moreover, one cannot see as fully\nactualized that which is still only possibly to be actualized, that is\nto say, the partially indeterminate future. It is noteworthy, however,\nthat process theism retains one element of the traditional view. We\nhave seen that Hartshorne attributes the laws of nature to an act of\nGod. For this reason, God knows the extent to which the future is\nopen\u2014what the laws allow and what they do not allow. The process\nGod must also be aware of the conditions that creaturely decisions set\nupon future actualization, opening up some possibilities and closing\nothers.\n\nProcess theists were not the first to notice the problems that the\nThomistic account poses for human freedom. William of Ockham, for\nexample, despaired of explaining how God could come to know the future\nfree decisions of the creatures (Shields 1993, 298). Luis de Molina\ndeveloped the chief rival in classical theism to Aquinas\u2019s\naccount of the mechanics of omniscience. Molinism has been much\ndiscussed in recent literature and vigorously defended (Shields &\nViney 2004, 241, n. 15). Molina claims that there are true statements\nabout what any possible creature would freely do in any\nsituation in which that creature existed. The truth of these\nstatements, called \u201cmiddle knowledge conditionals,\u201d is\ndecided by neither God nor the creatures; they are simply eternally\ntrue, a kind of innate divine knowledge. Molina agrees with Aquinas\nthat the deity knows the product of its own creative\nactivity\u2014called \u201cfree knowledge\u201d (Kenny 1979, 62).\nUsing free knowledge, in conjunction with middle knowledge\nconditionals, God can deduce what any actual creature will freely\ndo. The deduction has the form: \u201cIf individual X\nwere in situation S, then X would freely decide\nA\u201d (middle knowledge conditional); and\n\u201cX is in S\u201d (God\u2019s free\nknowledge); therefore, \u201cX will freely decide\nA.\u201d Molina\u2019s theory is designed to save both the\nfreedom of the creatures and the divine immutability and\nimpassibility. Thus, it poses as much of a challenge to process theism\nas does Thomism which claims for itself the same advantages.\n\nNeither Whitehead nor Hartshorne addresses Molinism, but process\nmetaphysics provides resources for a number of criticisms (Shields\n& Viney 2004, 225\u2013233). One objection is that Molinism\nendows God with an innate knowledge of an elaborate set of contingent\ntruths which have no explanation. Yet, contingent truths are precisely\nthe sorts of truths for which we legitimately seek\nexplanations\u2014indeed, this is one of the marks of contingency\n(Hartshorne 1962, 74). A related problem is that the distinction\nbetween the possible and the actual is finessed. It is common to refer\nto what an actual individual would do in a certain\ncircumstance, for one can speak of that individual\u2019s\ndispositions and character as so far formed. To refer to what a\npossible individual would do is entirely different. Possible\nindividuals are either fictional (like Sherlock Holmes) or they are\ntied to the creative powers of the actual world (like a child yet to\nbe conceived). The properties of fictional characters are defined by\nsomeone\u2019s imagination and so there is no fixed truth about what\nthey would do. Arguably, persons yet to be conceived can only be said\nto have the properties that link them to the reproductive\npotentialities of actual persons. Thus, most babies have the capacity\nto grow up to become parents themselves. What may the first child\n(call it Chris) of a particular newborn (call it Kim) be like? The\nmost that can be said with certainty is that half of Chris\u2019s\nchromosomes will be inherited from Kim. To speak informatively about\nwhat Chris would do under any given circumstances presupposes\nuncountable human decisions and years of development beyond\nKim\u2019s own childhood.\n\nA third and final criticism of Molinism, from a process perspective,\nis that it doesn\u2019t really preserve the freedom of the creatures\nin the way it claims. Molina verbally accepts the idea that one is\nsignificantly free only if one could have done otherwise in the same\ncircumstances (in the literature this is called incompatibilist\nfreedom). For example, if Oswald\u2019s assassination of President\nKennedy was a genuinely free act then if, per impossibile,\nthe clock could be turned back to the moments before the murder,\nOswald could have decided not to pull the trigger. Alternately stated,\nOswald\u2019s not pulling the trigger in the exact situation where he\nin fact did pull the trigger could have become actual. In\nHartshorne\u2019s view, and as far as incompatibilist freedom is\nconcerned, to be actually possible is to be (or to have been)\npossibly actual. On Molinist principles, it is difficult to see\nhow Oswald\u2019s not pulling the trigger in those circumstances\ncould have become actual. It is true that, in Molina\u2019s view,\nthere is no contradiction in conceiving Oswald in those circumstances\nnot pulling the trigger. But, given the set of middle knowledge\nconditionals about Oswald, Oswald\u2019s not pulling the trigger\nhappens in no world that God can create (this is not to say that if a\ndifferent set of middle knowledge conditionals were true of Oswald God\ncould not create those possible worlds). The events, however, that can\nbecome actual, that are actually possible, are events in universes\ncreated by God. Since, under the assumption of the set of middle\nknowledge conditionals we know to be true of Oswald, no universe that\ncould be created by God\u2014no possible actuality\u2014is one in\nwhich Oswald freely refrains from pulling the trigger, Oswald\u2019s\nact cannot be considered a free act. Of course, it may be the case\nthat the set of middle knowledge conditionals concerning Oswald are\nsuch that he could have refrained from pulling the trigger had God\ncreated a slightly different universe; but it is Oswald\u2019s\nfreedom in the actual universe that is at issue.\n\nThe problems of the mechanics of omniscience aside, the traditional\ntheist might argue that the process view of God\u2019s knowledge is\nproblematic because it either limits God\u2019s knowledge or it\nviolates elementary principles of logic. The argument is apparently\nstraightforward. Every proposition of the form, \u201cp or\nnot-p\u201d is true because one or the other side of the\ndisjunction is true. To use Aristotle\u2019s example from De\nInterpretatione IX, either a sea battle will occur tomorrow or it\nwill not. Let p represent \u201cA sea battle will occur\ntomorrow\u201d and not-p, \u201cA sea battle will not occur\ntomorrow.\u201d In that case, \u201cA sea battle will occur tomorrow\nor a sea battle will not occur tomorrow\u201d is a tautology and\nhence true. If God does not know which side of the disjunction is true\nthen God\u2019s knowledge is limited. If the disjunction itself is\nnot true then some tautologies are false. Any theory that commits one\nto the falsity of some tautologies flaunts the fundamental principles\nof logic and thereby faces a steep burden of proof.\n\nAristotle apparently believed that, where future contingents are\nconcerned, \u201cp or not-p\u201d is true but the\ntwo halves of the disjunction have indeterminate truth values. This\nidea seems logically counter-intuitive. If p and\nnot-p are indeterminate, shouldn\u2019t \u201cp or\nnot-p\u201d also be indeterminate? For a brief period,\nHartshorne defended the Aristotelian idea (Hartshorne 1939), but he\ndiscovered a more parsimonious solution (Hartshorne 2011c, 123).\nInstead of locating the indeterminacy of the future in truth values,\nhe focused on predicates that reflect the extent to which the future\nis open for any given event. Either all causal conditions are such\nthat the sea battle will occur, or no causal conditions are such that\nit will occur, or it is permitted by some but not all causal\nconditions (cf. Hartshorne 1970, 145). It \u201cwill\u201d occur\nmeans that all the possibilities for tomorrow which are still left\nopen involve the occurrence in question; while it \u201cmay\u201d\noccur means that some of the open possibilities involve the\noccurrence; and it \u201cwill not\u201d occur means that none of the\npossibilities involve it (Hartshorne 1941, 100).\n\nAlthough Hartshorne rejected Aristotle\u2019s view on future\ncontingents, his solution to the problem that Aristotle tried to solve\nneatly parallels Aristotle\u2019s square. \u201cZ will\noccur\u201d and \u201cZ will not occur\u201d are\ncontraries\u2014they may both be false but they cannot both be true.\nThe contradictory of \u201cZ will occur\u201d is\n\u201cZ may not occur\u201d; similarly, the contradictory\nof \u201cZ will not occur\u201d is \u201cZ may\noccur.\u201d In A Christmas Carol, Scrooge presupposes this\nschema when he asks the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, \u201cAre\nthese the shadows of the things that Will be or the shadows of things\nthat May be, only?\u201d Of this example, Hartshorne said,\n\u201cThere is a master of language [i.e. Dickens]. Will and May are\nnicely distinguished in ordinary speech\u201d (Hartshorne & Viney\n2001, 39).\n\nHartshorne maintains that, \u201cthe semantic analysis of truth with\nreference to future events should not be so formulated as to make\n\u2018will\u2019 and \u2018will not\u2019 the sole\npossibilities\u201d (Hartshorne 2011a, 83). Following\nHartshorne\u2019s suggestion, George Shields says that,\n\u201cZ will occur\u201d and \u201cZ will not\noccur\u201d should not be symbolized in the propositional calculus as\np and not-p but as p and q, where\n\u201cIf p then not-q\u201d and \u201cIf\nq then not-p.\u201d The conjunction of these\npropositions, \u201cIf p then not-q and if\nq then not-p\u201d mirrors the truth value\nsemantics of contrariety, not contradiction, which is mirrored by\n\u201cIt is false that \u2018p if and only if\nq,\u2019\u201d or exclusive disjunction. Shields argues\nthat it is question begging to assume that \u201cZ will or\nwill not occur\u201d must be an instance of \u201cp or\nnot-p\u201d. The question at issue is the formalization of\nfuture tense statements; thus, it will not do to assume that verb\ntense makes no difference in the formalization (Shields & Viney\n2004, 220).\n8. Transforming Traditional Theism and Process Theism\n\nWhitehead says that, \u201cPhilosophy never reverts to its old\nposition after the shock of a great philosopher\u201d (Whitehead\n1929 [1978, 11]). Whether or not Whitehead and Hartshorne are considered\ngreat philosophers, they seem to have occasioned a seismic shift in\ncontemporary discussions of the philosophy of religion in which\nphilosophers take the doctrine of real relations in God more\nseriously. For example, some Neo-Thomists have taken the criticisms of\nprocess theism to heart and admitted real relations in God, contrary\nto the teaching of the angelic doctor (Whitney 1985, 75\u201381). The\nJesuit philosopher W. Norris Clarke advises Thomists to \u201csimply\ndrop\u201d the doctrine of the lack of real relations in God and to\nadopt the view that, \u201c[God\u2019s] consciousness is\ncontingently and qualitatively different because of what we\ndo\u201d (Clarke 1979, 92). At times, Clarke almost sounds like a\nWhiteheadian or a Hartshornean: \u201cGod is the supreme\nReceiver, gathering together in His consciousness all that\ncreatures do and responding appropriately to it\u201d (Ibid., 93).\nAnother example of a group of theists influenced by process thinking,\nare those Evangelical Christian philosophers calling themselves\n\u201copen theists\u201d or \u201cfree will theists.\u201d While\ncareful to distance themselves from the more heretical dimensions of\nprocess metaphysics, they have stirred controversy in their\ncommunities of faith by defending aspects of process theism (Pinnock\net al. 1994; Enxing 2013, ch. 5; Rice 2020).\n\nThe extent to which theists outside the process camp accept the\nelements of the doctrine of dual transcendence varies greatly.\nNeo-Thomists like Clarke and some other theists, like William Alston,\naccept real relations in God but retain the timelessness,\nimmutability, and non-corporeality of God. Clarke and Alston also\naffirm creation ex nihilo. Alston, who was Hartshorne\u2019s\nstudent at Chicago, refers to his view as a \u201cvia\nmedia\u201d (a middle path) between Hartshorne and Aquinas (Cobb\n& Gamwell 1984, 78f). Hartshorne responded to both Clarke and\nAlston (Sia 1990, 269f; Cobb & Gamwell 1984, 98f). In both replies\nhe emphasizes, among other things, what he takes to be arbitrary\ndivisions among contingency, potentiality, and change in their\ntheories. To admit real relations in God is to admit contingency in\nGod. To admit this, but to retain the concept of the non-temporality\nof deity, requires belief in contingencies eternally fixed in the\nbeing of God. The ordinary sense of \u201cW is\ncontingent\u201d is \u201cW could have been\notherwise,\u201d which presupposes that the future was once open with\nrespect to W. Since there is no future in eternity, to speak\nof contingency in eternity is to lose one\u2019s anchor in ordinary\nlanguage which is saturated with temporal reference. Likewise, the\nconcept of an eternal \u201cnow\u201d has lost all moorings with\nexperience where the present is invariably nested between past and\nfuture. Hartshorne also maintains that there are forms of\nvalue\u2014specifically, aesthetic values\u2014that do not admit of\na maximum. It may be no more meaningful to speak of greatest possible\naesthetic value than it is to speak of a greatest positive integer\n(Hartshorne 1970, 38 and 310; cf. Whitehead 1929 [1978, 111]). If this is the\ncase, and if the creatures contribute to the aesthetic value of the\nworld, then there must be respects in which, as the aesthetic value of\nthe world increases, God increases with it. We have already touched\nupon this aspect of process theism which Hartshorne refers to as\nGod\u2019s relative perfection (R-perfection).\n\nOpenness or free will theists are closer to process theism than the\nNeo-Thomists or than Alston. They concur with process theists that God\ncannot determine a creature\u2019s decisions without depriving it of\nits freedom. They also accept the process view of the nature of time;\nthus, for God to be influenced by the creatures means that in some\nrespects the future is yet to be determined and God knows it as such.\nThis provides for a straightforward concept of God responding to the\ncreatures and for an interpretive scheme for the dominant Scriptural\nmotif that God is in dynamic interaction with people (in answering\nprayer, for example). On the other hand, it is this aspect of process\ntheism which seems most disturbing to more traditionally minded\nEvangelicals, for the lack of knowledge of a detailed future\ncompromises or at least complicates the doctrine of divine providence.\nHow, they ask, can history be the working out of a divine plan if the\nfuture is uncertain for God (cf. Hall and Sanders, 2003). Open theists\nbelieve that they can mitigate this criticism by not following process\ntheism in the denial of creation ex nihilo. Open theists like\nWilliam Hasker and John Sanders can speak of God as \u201ca\nrisk-taker,\u201d but they insist that God can still perform miracles\nand guarantee the ultimate triumph of good over evil (Pinnock, et al.,\n1994, 151; Sanders 1998).\n\nTo speak of open theism as a school of thought distinct from process\ntheism is ironic since God\u2019s openness to creaturely influence is\nprecisely the shared content of their views. Hartshorne referred to\n\u201cthe openness of God\u201d in 1963, more than thirty years\nbefore the openness controversy erupted (Hartshorne 1987, 92). In any\nevent, these controversies began too late for Hartshorne to respond to\nthem. It is noteworthy, however, that he was instrumental in bringing\na little known forerunner of open theism, Jules Lequyer [or Lequier],\nto the attention of philosophers (Hartshorne & Reese 1953 [2000,\n227\u2013230]). Because of the dominance historically of classical\ntheism, Hartshorne viewed free will or open theists more as allies\nthan foes, although he was fully aware of his differences from them\nand was not without arguments against those aspects of their views\nwith which he disagreed (Viney 1998, 214\u2013230). A vigorous\ndialogue between process theists and free will theists is on-going\n(Cobb and Pinnock 2000; Ramal 2010, part II).\n\nThe most contentious issue is creation ex nihilo. Whitehead\nand Hartshorne share a commitment to the idea that God is the supreme\ncreative power among many lesser creators. Hartshorne is adamant that\nnothing is gained by endowing God with the ability to create\nnon-creative actualities or to refrain from creating altogether.\nNevertheless, process theists are criticized for failing to consider\nthe alternative that God, the sole origin of creative power,\ngraciously shares that power with others. Lequyer speaks of\n\u201cGod, who created me creator of myself\u201d\u2014words that\nHartshorne often quotes with approval (Lequier 1952, 70; Hartshorne\n1970, xi). Lequyer\u2019s view is similar to what Nelson Pike calls\n\u201cover-power,\u201d the power to \u201ccompletely determine\nwhich, if any, powers are possessed by agents other than\noneself\u201d (Pike 1983, 19). Pike avers that over-power is\nprecisely what most classical theists ascribe to deity. Process\ntheists generally disagree (cf. Griffin 1991, 67\u201368). For\nexample, Aquinas views God as having the ability to determine the free\ndecisions of others, but this ability is not entailed by\nover-power, although Pike sometimes defines over-power in these terms\n(Pike 1982, 151). If God has over-power in the sense of being able to\ndetermine the extent to which others can make free decisions and\nexecute them, it does not follow that God can also determine a\ncreature\u2019s free decisions. The latter claim is much stronger,\nand it is the one that process theists attribute to most classical\ntheists.\n\nThe process God has what might be called a second cousin to\nover-power. As we have seen, in process theism, God is responsible for\nthe laws of nature and these laws determine the limits of non-divine\ncreativity. Whitehead and Hartshorne deny, however, that God could\ncreate actual entities devoid of creative activity. Moreover,\ndevelopmental and evolutionary categories are central to their\nthinking. It is contrary to process philosophy to imagine God with the\nability to create a fully grown man or woman who did not grow to\nadulthood from having been a child. One\u2019s being actual\nis inseparable from one\u2019s having become actual\n(Hartshorne 1941, 233\u2013234). Hartshorne would say that this is\nalso true of God\u2019s actual states, though not of God\u2019s\nexistence. These qualifications notwithstanding, one philosopher\nworking within the process tradition advocates revisions in process\ntheism that would move it in the direction that the critics suggest.\nRem Edwards speaks of divine self-limitation in creating the\ncreatures. For Edwards, God could create a universe of uncreative\nbeings but chooses not to. He thinks that God could \u201cwork an\noccasional miracle or two.\u201d Edwards acknowledges that, from the\nstandpoint of \u201corthodox\u201d process thought, these ideas are\n\u201cprocess heresy,\u201d but he prefers revising process theism\nin these ways in order to avoid the charge, which he regards as\nlegitimate, that there is a \u201cdivine power-deficit\u201d in\nprocess theism that makes its outlook \u201creligiously\nintolerable\u201d (Edwards 2001, 256).\n\nThe claim that deity sharing its creative power is an instance of\nself-limitation can perhaps be clarified and placed more in the spirit\nof process theism by referring to it as divine\nself-augmentation. A self-imposed handicap is one that prevents\none from achieving a goal or performing a task that one could\naccomplish without the limitation. As Inbody notes, any divine\nself-limitation can be \u201cself-unlimited\u201d (Inbody 1997,\n149). For example, a governor on a truck can be designed to inhibit\nthe velocity it could attain without the governor. In creating other\ncreators, however, the deity imposes no limits on what it could\nachieve without them. To be sure, God could have unerring knowledge of\na determinate future if the creatures had no freedom, but this would\nnot be knowledge of a future with free creatures in it. To imagine a\nlimitation in this case would require that God could know the future\ndecisions of free creatures, but chooses instead to put on a\nblindfold, so to speak. On the other hand, the existence of non-divine\ncreators opens opportunities for cooperative effort (and conflict)\nthat would be impossible without them. One cannot use persuasion on\ncompletely unfree beings. Thus, in creating other creators, other\nbeings with some degree of freedom, God would be perfecting the divine\npower and the uses to which it can be put.\n\nEdwards also affirms a version of the doctrine of creation ex\nnihilo and believes that this is compatible with process theism.\nInspired by developments in speculative cosmology among\nastrophysicists\u2014which he insists is really\nmetaphysics\u2014Edwards asks whether our universe may not be one of\nmany actual universes existing within an infinite Superspacetime. This\nsuper matrix of co-existing but independent universes could be\ninterpreted by process theism as the divine body, much as Hartshorne\nviews our universe as God\u2019s body. Edwards maintains that these\nideas allow for a concept of creation ex nihilo. Within the\ndivine Superspacetime, God can create universes from no pre-existing\nmaterial. Thus, it is not necessary to conceive our own universe as\ncreated from the dying embers of a previous cosmic epoch. The initial\nsingularity of our universe could represent an absolute beginning.\nThis does not mean that one must jettison the claims of process theism\nthat God is necessarily social, embodied, and creative. In\nEdwards\u2019 words:\n\nWithin infinite Divine Superspacetime, God could be infinitely loving,\nsocial, embodied, and creative without being tied to a single temporal\nstrand of spatially finite antecedent-and-successive universes. Within\ninfinite Superspace and throughout infinite Supertime, God could\ncreate many co-existing universes out of nothing \u2026. (Edwards\n2001, 262)\n\n\nEdwards notes that his suggestions are not as far removed from the\nmetaphysics of Whitehead and Hartshorne as one might suppose.\nWhitehead speaks of cosmic epochs and Hartshorne argues that this\ninvolves a time beyond what is available to physics that connects\nvarious cosmic epochs (Hartshorne 1970, 53\u201354). Edwards views\nhimself as amending Hartshorne\u2019s idea to include super space as\nwell as super time.\n\nEdwards\u2019 treatment of creation ex nihilo retains the\nessential meaning of the idea\u2014creation from no pre-existing\nmaterial\u2014but it also suggests both less and more than the\nconcept as it was expressed in classical theism. It suggests less in\nthe sense that God\u2019s creative act in traditional theism takes\nplace in eternity. Superspacetime differs from the Boethian idea of\neternity in at least this much: it is complex whereas eternity has no\nparts. Edwards also wishes to avoid the deterministic connotations of\nthe traditional idea of creation. To create another creator is\nnot to create that creator\u2019s decisions; this is one\nreason Aquinas denies that God creates other creators, for he regards\nGod as creating, with us, the decisions we make in such a way that\nGod\u2019s activity is a sufficient explanation of our decisions\n(although he denies, contrary to the charge of process theism, that\nthis deprives us of our freedom). Finally, Edwards imports more into\nthe idea of creation ex nihilo than was traditionally in the\ndoctrine. As we noted in the opening section, the idea that the\nuniverse had a first temporal moment is not to be identified with\ncreation ex nihilo since, according to traditional theism,\nGod could have created a temporally infinite universe ex\nnihilo.\n\nEdwards\u2019 revisions of process theism are made largely, though\nnot exclusively, in light of criticisms from those who do not share\nhis commitment to process metaphysics. Lewis Ford revises process\ntheism in a very different direction, mostly in response to\ndifficulties within process metaphysics that he finds insurmountable.\nWe have already seen that in Whitehead\u2019s metaphysics, the way\nthat one actual entity influences another is by means of prehensions.\nAccording to Ford, an additional mode of influence must be posited,\nfor one must account for an actual entity\u2019s ability to\nprehend. This ability to prehend is precisely its portion of\ncreativity. Ford remains within the parameters of process metaphysics\nby denying that the entity\u2019s allotment of creativity has its\nsource outside of time in an eternal being. This leaves only three\npossible sources for the entity\u2019s creativity, the past, the\npresent, or the future. Ford maintains that past actual entities,\nbecause they are past, are devoid of any inner creativity\u2014thus,\nthey cannot be the source of an actual entity\u2019s creativity. Nor\ncan creativity simply \u201cwell up\u201d from within the present.\nIt is precisely an actual occasion\u2019s present creativity\nthat needs explanation, and it cannot pull itself up by its own\nbootstraps, so to speak. Ford argues, by elimination, that a future\ncreativity must be the source of an occasion\u2019s ability to\nprehend.\n\nIn process metaphysics, the future is infinite, indeterminate, and its\npossibilities for actualization are inexhaustible. Ford identifies God\nwith the future so conceived, but with one important departure from\nstandard accounts in process thought. According to Ford, God is\nthe activity of the future. This is contrary to the views of\nWhitehead and Hartshorne for whom the future is the arena of\npossibility awaiting decision. Creative activity is confined to the\npresent actual entity (called its concrescence) and to its effects on\nsubsequent actual entities (called transitional creativity) (Whitehead\n1929 [1978, 211]). In Ford\u2019s view, however, the future is a soundless\ndepth of creativity that endlessly \u201cpluralizes itself into the\nmany finite regions of the present\u201d (Ford 2000, 248). This is a\nprocess whereby divine future activity is \u201cinfused\u201d into\nthe present actual occasion (Ibid., 253). In Ford\u2019s view,\npresent activity makes the past in the sense that what is\ndone today adds to what will be the accomplished past of tomorrow. The\npresent is not made by the past but by the divine activity of the\nfuture.\n\nBecause the divine is indeterminate, it cannot be an object of an\nactual entity\u2019s prehensions. This is dangerously close to saying\nthat God cannot be known, except that Ford understands God to fill a\ndefinite role in his metaphysics, to wit, the infusion of creativity\ninto the present, providing for an immediacy of the divine presence in\nall actualities. Ford also recognizes the difficulty that his view\nposes for God\u2019s knowledge of the past, and hence for divine\nomniscience. The physical prehensions of actual occasions are not only\nthe means whereby the present takes account of the past, but they are\nalso the means whereby the past persists into the present. As\nHartshorne notes, Whitehead\u2019s concept of prehension brings\nefficient causation and perception under a single category (Hartshorne\n1984b, chapter 9). If the past were to persist into the future so as\nto impart knowledge to God, it would co-opt the present\u2019s\nfunction of preserving the past. In order to avoid the idea that God\nis ignorant of the past, Ford posits a kind of knowledge of the past\nthat abstracts from efficient causation. In the interstices separating\nthe death of the past moment and the birth of the present moment,\n\u201cGod immediately perceives the recently emergent past and\nretains that memory forever\u201d (Ford 2000, 284). Since divine\nmemory, on Ford\u2019s account, abstracts from efficient causal\nrelations, it is clear that it records sequences and correlations of\nevents; it is a fair question whether it also contains information\nabout causal chains.\n\nFord recognizes that his revisions of process theism will strike some\nthinkers as contrary to the metaphysics that first inspired it. He\ncorrectly observes, \u201cThe notion of an active future may be\nregarded as oxymoronic, even as bizarre, but it is certainly\nunique\u201d (Ford 2000, 316). It is indeed unique; it bears a\nresemblance to the Thomistic doctrine of participated being, albeit\ntailored to the categories of process philosophy, as modified in\nvarious ways by Ford. In Thomism, the creatures can exist only by\nparticipating in and channeling the infinite creativity of God. In\nFord\u2019s revised process theism, non-divine actual entities can\nexist only by borrowing the influx of future divine activity into the\npresent. The parallel with Thomism breaks down insofar as Ford denies\nthat God\u2019s activity explains what the actual entities do with\ntheir portion of creativity. Ford can affirm the freedom of the\ncreatures vis-a-vis God\u2019s activity since deity does not function\nas a deterministic efficient cause as it does in Thomism and other\nforms of traditional theism. In Whitehead\u2019s and\nHartshorne\u2019s theism, there is an efficient causal dimension to\nGod\u2019s creativity, but it is not deterministic. We have already\nnoted that the process God\u2019s fixing of the laws of nature is a\nform of efficient causation, but Whitehead and Hartshorne agree with\nmost current scientific thinking that those laws are stochastic.\n9. Arguments for the Existence of God in Process Theism\n\nOur task has been to explain the concept of process theism, not to\nargue that the God of process theism exists. Nevertheless, a few words\nare in order about the approaches that process theists take to\njustifying belief in the existence of God. We noted in opening that\nprocess theism does not privilege claims to special insight or\nrevealed truth (cf. Keller 2007, chapter 6). This is not to say that\nsome theologians have not found process thought congenial to their\ninterests (e.g., Ogden 1963; Cobb 1965; Griffin 1973). Whitehead and\nHartshorne did not view themselves as apologists for a particular\nfaith, but neither did they simply dismiss religious experiences as\nuninformative. Whitehead warns against narrowness in the selection of\nevidence. He says, \u201cPhilosophy may not neglect the\nmultifariousness of the world\u2014the fairies dance, and Christ is\nnailed to the cross\u201d (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 338]). They add, however,\nthat the claims that religious people make, individually (as in the\ncase of mystics) or collectively (as in the case of religious\norganizations), are subject to human fallibility. There may be a God\nwho is infallible but human beings are not, and every putative\nrevelation is sifted through an imperfect human filter (Hartshorne\n1984a, 41). As far as justifying religious belief is concerned,\nWhitehead and Hartshorne try to navigate between appeals to blind\nfaith and knock-down proof. In metaphysics, says Whitehead, \u201cThe\nproper test is not that of finality, but of progress\u201d (Whitehead\n1929 [1978, 14]).\n\nIf process theism is not based on revelation, neither is it based on\nna\u00efve appeals to science, including the social sciences. It is no\nmore characteristic of process thought to give a\n\u201cscientific\u201d argument for the existence of God than to\ngive a reductionistic account of religious belief by means of a theory\nin sociology, psychology, or more broadly, what F. LeRon Shults calls\n\u201cthe biocultural study of religion\u201d (Shults 2018). As far\nas Whitehead and Hartshorne are concerned, the working assumptions of\nthe sciences are no more or less open to question and clarification\nthan the working assumptions of religion. Process thought teaches a\nmodest skepticism about the competencies of science that is arguably\nin the spirit of science itself. Indeed, the theory of actual entities\nand their prehensions is Whitehead\u2019s alternative to the\nmetaphysical worldview that developed as a result of the dramatic\nsuccesses of early modern science\u2014Whitehead calls it\n\u201cscientific materialism.\u201d The theory of actual entities is\na response to the idea that the \u201cstuff\u201d of which the world\nis made is devoid of mind-like qualities\u2014Whitehead refers to\nthis as \u201cvacuous actuality.\u201d The theory of prehensions is\na response to the idea that bits of matter can exist at definite\nplaces and times without any essential reference to other places and\ntimes\u2014Whitehead refers to this as \u201csimple location.\u201d\nThe fact is that Whitehead wrote relatively little about God and a\ngreat deal about how his philosophy of organism resolves problems of\nmetaphysics and epistemology inherited from a prior age.\n\nProcess theism is not based on religious doctrine or theology and it\nis not a scientific theory; it is a product of metaphysics, or what\nWhitehead calls \u201cspeculative philosophy.\u201d It is, however,\nmetaphysics \u201cin a new key,\u201d to borrow a phrase from\nSusanne Langer. Whitehead says that, \u201cSpeculative philosophy is\nthe endeavour to frame a coherent, logical, necessary system of\ngeneral ideas in terms of which every element of our experience can be\ninterpreted\u201d (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 3]). Metaphysics, so defined, is an\naudacious enterprise, for experience is open-ended and every claim to\nknowledge is perspectival and conditioned. If metaphysicians strive\nfor a comprehensive vision of things, they must continually remind\nthemselves that there is no standpoint within the world from which to\nspeak confidently for eternity. Whitehead and Hartshorne reject the\nidea that metaphysics proceeds best by deducing theorems from\nself-evident axioms. To be sure, inferences must be made from the\ncategories of one\u2019s metaphysics, but it is the categories\nthemselves that are continually on trial. The court in which\nmetaphysical proposals are judged is the community of philosophers,\nstretching through history and into the future. Whitehead and\nHartshorne, heavily influenced by Plato, practice philosophy as a\ndialogue with great minds, past and present. Hartshorne, taking a page\nfrom Karl Popper, says that, \u201cObjectivity is not in the\nindividual thinker but in the process of mutual correction and\ninspiration\u201d (Hartshorne 1962, ix).\n\nWhen it comes to the \u201cGod question\u201d Whitehead says that he\nis not offering proofs. \u201cThere is merely the confrontation of\nthe theoretic system with a certain rendering of the facts\u201d\n(Whitehead 1929 [1978, 343]). Having established to his satisfaction an\nalternative to scientific materialism\u2014that is, the philosophy of\norganism\u2014he asks whether that philosophy\u2019s categories\nrequire reference to God. Ford suggests that Whitehead was surprised\nto find that they do, for he began his reflections on the philosophy\nof nature as an agnostic (Ford 1977, 27). In keeping with his\nsensitivity to the history of philosophy, Whitehead characterizes his\ndiscussion as adding another speaker to David Hume\u2019s\nDialogues Concerning Natural Religion. If Whitehead has an\n\u201cargument\u201d for the existence of God it is implicit in the\ndual attempt (1) to show the reasonableness of process metaphysics and\n(2) to show the conceptual necessity of God for its overall coherence.\nRudolf Carnap says that it is one thing to ask what one\u2019s\nmetaphysics commit one to and it is something else to ask what commits\none to one\u2019s metaphysics. Whitehead asks both questions.\n\nFord rightly says that, in Whitehead\u2019s writings, the problem and\nnature of God is nowhere explored for its own sake (Ford 1970, 393).\nMoreover, during the period when he was introducing the concept of God\ninto his metaphysics, beginning in 1925, the very concept of God was\nin flux. For these reasons, there is an inherent flexibility in\nreconstructing arguments for God\u2019s existence from\nWhitehead\u2019s work, and this is reflected in the critical\nliterature. Hartshorne identified six arguments implicit in\nWhitehead\u2019s metaphysics (Hartshorne 1972, 78\u201388), but\nothers find fewer (Sherburne 1971) or more (Griffin 2001a, chapter 5).\nFord attempted to derive the existence of God analytically, as a\ntheorem from the set of axioms in Whitehead\u2019s categoreal scheme\nin Process and Reality; his much abbreviated version of\nWhitehead\u2019s reasoning is this: \u201cActual entities either\nbelong to God or to the World. Given the World, God must exist. Given\nGod, the World must exist. Since one or the other must exist, both\nmust\u201d (Ford 1970, 393). Interestingly, the God to which\nFord\u2019s reconstructed argument concludes is a single non-temporal\nactual entity, and no mention is made of developments in\nWhitehead\u2019s idea of God after Process and Reality.\n\nMore traditional forms of reasoning can also be found in Whitehead.\nThere cannot, to be sure, be a cosmological argument in the classical\nsense for Whitehead rejects the traditional idea of divine creativity,\nbut he does see a need to explain the initial phase of each actual\nentity. In Whitehead\u2019s view, God customizes the general\npotentiality of the universe for each emergent occasion, providing it\nwith its initial aim. The graded relevance of these potentialities\nanswers to our sense that there are objectively better and worse\noptions. A related problem is how the activities of the many\nactualities that make up the cosmos happen to obey a common set of\nnatural laws. Order implies an ordering power; however, all localized\norder presupposes cosmic order; thus, order on a cosmic scale requires\na cosmic ordering power. The best candidate for the cosmic ordering\npower is God, according to Whitehead (Whitehead 1926 [1997, 104])\u2014this\nis a type of design argument. Another consideration is that the realm\nof possibility in terms of which cosmic order is conceived is akin to\nPlato\u2019s Forms. In Whitehead\u2019s system, these \u201ceternal\nobjects\u201d require an ontological ground. The primordial nature of\nGod serves this function (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 46]). Finally, the consequent\nnature of God is the explanation of the fixity of accomplished fact\nand achieved value. \u201cThe truth itself is nothing else than how\nthe composite natures of the organic actualities of the world obtain\nadequate representation in the divine nature\u201d (Whitehead 1929 [1978,\n12]). This sketch of Whitehead\u2019s reasoning may suggest that his\n\u201carguments\u201d lose their force when abstracted from his\nmetaphysics. Bowman L. Clarke, however, produced a formal theistic\nargument along Whiteheadian lines using the linguistic framework\ndeveloped by Nelson Goodman (Clarke 1966, 162\u2013164). In a\ndifferent vein, Franklin Gamwell argues that the moral law must be\ngrounded in the divine good, where the divine good is most\nparsimoniously conceived in neoclassical terms (Gamwell 1990). Another\nprocess thinker, Derek Malone-France, argues that the promise of\nKant\u2019s transcendental philosophy is best fulfilled in a\nWhiteheadian inspired theistic metaphysics (Malone-France 2007). Thus,\narguing for the existence of Whitehead\u2019s God, or something like\nWhitehead\u2019s God, need not be inextricably tied to evaluating\nWhitehead\u2019s metaphysics.\n\nThe debate among Whiteheadians over the existence of God is\ncomplicated by the fact that Whitehead\u2019s views rapidly evolved\nfrom the time he began teaching at Harvard in 1924. His view of God is\nless a completed philosophical theism than a work in progress that was\nleft to others to try to complete, and many have tried. It is worthy\nof note, however, that an influential group of scholars maintain that\nWhitehead was not true to his finer insights when he included God in\nhis metaphysical system. Donald Sherburne wrote a pivotal article in\n1967, revised in 1971, titled \u201cWhitehead without God.\u201d\nSherburne holds that God can be \u201cexorcised\u201d from\nWhitehead\u2019s metaphysics by showing that the existence of God is\ninconsistent with its categories and by demonstrating that all of the\nfunctions ascribed to deity in the system can be met in other ways.\nDonald Crosby and Frederick Ferr\u00e9 (1933\u20132013), also\nwithin the process fold, hold similar views. Ferr\u00e9 considers\ntheism \u201coptional\u201d in the sense that the premises of\ntheistic arguments are subject to competing and equally rational value\ncommitments (Ferr\u00e9 2001, 177f). One of the most careful and\npersistent critics of process theism is Robert Neville (Neville 1980).\nNeville does not argue for \u201cWhitehead without God\u201d so much\nas \u201cWhitehead without Whitehead\u2019s God.\u201d He believes\nthat Whitehead\u2019s critique of scientific materialism and his\nphilosophy of organism are basically correct, but that the ultimate\nexplanation of the universe is in a deity that wholly transcends it\nand creates it ex nihilo (Neville 1968). Griffin forcefully\ncriticized Neville\u2019s views (Griffin 2007, 186\u2013214) and\nNeville gave a spirited response (Neville 2008).\n\nHartshorne was more in the mainstream of philosophical discussions\nabout God than was Whitehead. He spoke of proofs for God\u2019s\nexistence and defended them vigorously, although he ceased calling\nthem \u201cproofs\u201d when he realized the differences between his\napproach and more traditional ones. Hartshorne is best known for his\nvoluminous writings on the ontological argument\u2014he devotes two\nbooks and numerous articles to the topic (Hartshorne 1962 &\n1965a). Despite his fondness for his revised ontological argument, he\nnever considered it sufficient unto itself to make the case for\nGod\u2019s existence. The ontological argument is one strand of a\nmultiple argument strategy\u2014which Basil Mitchell calls a\n\u201ccumulative case\u201d\u2014in which the various elements are\nmutually reinforcing.\n\nAll of the arguments are phases of one \u2018global\u2019 argument,\nthat the properly formulated theistically religious view of life\nand reality is the most intelligible, self-consistent, and\nsatisfactory one that can be conceived. (Hartshorne 1970, 276)\n\n\nHartshorne\u2019s versions of the cosmological, teleological (or\ndesign), moral, epistemic, and aesthetic arguments complete the set\nthat make up the global argument (Viney 1985).\n\nIn Hartshorne\u2019s view, the importance of the ontological argument\nis to establish that God could not exist contingently. He calls this\n\u201cAnselm\u2019s principle.\u201d If Anselm\u2019s principle is\ncorrect then if it is possible for God to exist, then God\nnecessarily exists. In Hartshorne\u2019s view, Anselm failed to make\na convincing case for God\u2019s existence because he failed to show\nthat his concept of God is coherently conceivable. Indeed, Hartshorne\nbelieves that matters are much worse for Anselm since he considers\nAnselm\u2019s form of theism to be incoherent, as we have seen.\nHartshorne believes that the other arguments in his own global\nargument make the case for God\u2019s possible existence. Contingent\nbeings require a divine necessary being (cosmological); cosmic order\nimplies a divine cosmic ordering power (design); reality should be\nconstrued as the actual content of divine knowledge (epistemic); the\nsupreme aim in life is to contribute to the divine life (moral); and\nthere is a beauty of the world as a whole that only God can enjoy\n(aesthetic). The structure of Hartshorne\u2019s argument is\nreminiscent of the elaborate case made by John Duns Scotus in De\nPrimo Principio. Of course, the God whose existence Hartshorne\nseeks to establish is one that \u201cthe subtle doctor\u201d would\nfind unacceptable.\n\nHartshorne presents each of the sub-arguments within his cumulative\ncase as a list of options from an exhaustive set, with his\nneoclassical theistic option rounding out the set. The reason for\npresenting his arguments as lists of options rather than as a series\nof disjunctive syllogisms is to avoid the pretense of offering strict\ndemonstrations. The conclusion of any valid deductive argument can be\nrejected provided one is willing to reject one or more of the\npremises. In this sense, a valid argument provides one with options\nfor belief rather than a proof of its conclusion. Hartshorne denies\nthat one can coerce belief in God with arguments. Moreover, he\nacknowledges that his own choice for neoclassical theism is not\nwithout its difficulties. He maintains, therefore, that one should\nemploy the \u201cprinciple of least paradox\u201d in assessing the\noptions. Since no metaphysical position is without its problems, it\nwill not do to argue for one\u2019s own view by finding the problems\nin the views of others. \u201cOne must decide which paradoxes are the\nreally fatal ones, in comparison with those of contending\npositions\u201d (Hartshorne 1970, 88).\n\nHartshorne presents his theistic arguments as a priori, not\nin the sense that they are conclusive demonstrations, but in the sense\nthat they aim at a conclusion about what is true in all possible\nstates of affairs. In this he is true to Whitehead\u2019s\nmetaphysical project of finding categories that are universal and\nnecessary. He insists that none of the conclusions of his arguments\nare empirical. A proposition is empirical, in Popper\u2019s sense, if\nit is falsifiable by some conceivable experience. If Anselm\u2019s\nprinciple is correct then either God exists without the possibility of\nnot existing or God\u2019s existence is impossible. Thus, if God\nexists, then no conceivable experience could falsify the statement\nthat God exists. For this reason, Hartshorne finds all empirical\narguments\u2014and hence, all scientifically based\narguments\u2014for God\u2019s existence to be fatally flawed since\nthey must conclude to that which is not God, that is, to that which\nexists contingently. Hartshorne also points out that none of his\narguments tell us anything concrete about God. True to his distinction\nbetween existence and actuality, Hartshorne maintains that the\narguments concern that which is most abstract about deity, its\nexistence and character. This is why Hartshorne claimed to know so\nvery little about God, even though he wrote so many volumes on the\nsubject (Hartshorne & Viney 2001, 46).\n\nAfter his ninetieth birthday, Hartshorne emphasized a somewhat\ndifferent approach in arguing for God\u2019s existence that\nincorporates his ideas about dual transcendence (Hartshorne 1993;\nHartshorne 2011b). He notes that from a purely formal point of view,\nany pair of metaphysical contraries may apply to God or to the world.\nFor example, either God is in different respects necessary and\ncontingent (NC), wholly necessary (N), wholly contingent (C), or\nneither necessary nor contingent (O). The same is true of the world:\nnecessary and contingent (nc), wholly necessary (n), wholly contingent\n(c), or neither necessary nor contingent (o). This yields sixteen\nformal options which Hartshorne arranges in a four by four matrix.\nHistorically significant forms of theism can be found on the\nmatrix\u2014classical theism, for example, is N.c and free will\ntheism is NC.c. Only one of the sixteen options can be true, so\nHartshorne develops criteria for judging the various possibilities.\nFor example, if the contrast itself should be preserved, then options\nlike N.n, C.c, and O.o are unacceptable. Of course, Hartshorne\u2019s\nconclusion is that NC.nc is the true option. Arguably, the value of\nthese matrices is as much in mapping concepts of God and the world as\nit is in arguing for a particular option, for they allow a more\ndetailed idea of the views that contradict one\u2019s own. Hartshorne\nmaintains that one reason classical theism remained unchallenged for\nso long was because philosophers had not considered all of the options\n(Hartshorne 1997, ch. 5). If any two matrices are combined, the number\nof formal options jumps to 256. If we generalize for any number of\npairs n, then the number of concepts of God and the world is\n16n.\n\nWe have already mentioned others within the process tradition who have\nmade the case for process theism: Clarke, Gamwell, and Malone-France.\nSchubert Ogden (1963) and David Ray Griffin (2001a and 2016) should be\nadded to the list. Griffin explicitly employs a cumulative case\ninvolving eight strands; his argument is indebted to both Whitehead\nand Hartshorne but includes his own distinctive contributions. Having\nfound the alternatives to process theism unsatisfactory, Griffin\nmaintains that \u201cprocess philosophy\u2019s naturalistic theism\nis overwhelmingly more probable than the truth of\natheism\u201d (2001a, 203). Also of note is that Griffin is one of\nthe few process philosophers to have addressed the arguments in the\nliterature of the new atheism (although, see Viney and Shields 2020,\nchapter 6).\n\nWith Hartshorne, as with Whitehead, what is at stake in theistic\narguments is less a matter of the soundness of a particular piece of\nreasoning than the assessment of an entire metaphysical system. Thus,\nthe sketch given here does not begin to do justice to their arguments.\nNevertheless, the development and defense of a concept of God that is\nfully engaged in temporal processes is perhaps the central pillar and\nthe lasting achievement of their reasoning. After all, one of the\nselling points of process theism over its rivals has been not only its\ntheoretical superiority in dealing with theological puzzles but its\nadequacy to everyday religious sensibilities. Process theists argue\nthat the deity of traditional theism is at once too active and too\nstatic. It is too active in the sense that its control of the universe\nis absolute, leaving nothing for the creatures to do except to\nunwittingly speak the lines and play the parts decided for them in\neternity. It is too static in the sense that it lacks potentiality to\nchange, to participate in the evolving universe it created, and to be\naffected by the triumphs and tragedies of its creatures. In short, it\nis a God who acts but is never acted upon and can therefore never\ninteract. This is summed up in the non-biblical Aristotelian formula\nof God as the unmoved mover. Fritz Rothschild describes the God of\nRabbi Abraham Heschel\u2014a God who feels and is felt by the\ncreatures\u2014as \u201cthe Most Moved Mover\u201d\n(Heschel 1959, 24). Hartshorne, who greatly admired Heschel, amends\nthis formula in an attempt to distill the essence of process theism,\n\u201cGod is the most and best moved mover\u201d\n(Hartshorne 1997, 6, 39).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Arnold, Daniel A., 1998, \u201cCan Hartshorne Escape Dharmakirti?\nSome Reflections with Implications for the Comparative Philosophy of\nReligion,\u201d <em>American Journal of Theology and Philosophy</em>,\n19(1): 3\u201333.", "Auxier, Randall E. and Mark Y.
