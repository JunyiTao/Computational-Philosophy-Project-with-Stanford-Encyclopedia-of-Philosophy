    "main_text": "Epistemological Arguments from Moral Disagreement || Merely Possible Disagreement\n4.3 Merely Possible Disagreement\n\n\nAn alternative way to try to accommodate the fact that there is\nnear-universal agreement about some moral claims, while still pursuing\na global form of moral skepticism, is to argue that the mere\npossibility of certain types of disagreement is enough to secure\nskeptical conclusions. That approach has been tried by William Tolhurst\n(1987, but see also Schiffer 2002, 288).\n\n\nTolhurst presents an argument whose conclusion is that no moral\nbeliefs are ever justified, if those beliefs are understood \u201con\nthe realist model\u201d (610). Its premises include two epistemic\nprinciples which together imply that if a person\u2019s belief that P\nis justified, then it is not possible for there to be another person\nwho is similar in all epistemically relevant respects and who believes\nnot-P. A further premise is that, for every person a and every\nmoral claim M which is accepted by a, it is indeed\npossible for there to be another person who shares a\u2019s\nnon-moral beliefs, is equally good at reasoning and is (therefore)\nsimilar in all relevant respects, and yet believes the negation of M.\nGiven that further premise, it follows that no moral belief is\njustified. As indicated, Tolhurst takes this argument to be conditional\non a realist understanding of moral beliefs. However, the premises make\nno mention of that assumption, and Tolhurst does not elaborate on how\nit would help a non-skeptic to adopt an alternative\n account.[5]\n\n\nIs the argument compelling? Tolhurst suggests that the best option\nfor those who want to resist it is to postulate \u201cthe existence of\na special ability to ascertain [\u2026] moral truth\u201d (614, see\nWright 1992, 152\u2013156, for a related suggestion). For that would allow\none to hold that there are relevant respects in which we may differ\nfrom our possible opponents, besides those concerning our non-moral\nbeliefs and (general) reasoning skills. In the ensuing discussion,\nTolhurst notes that, by postulating a special ability, realists would\n\u201cincur a significant theoretical debt\u201d (621), but he holds\nopen whether they can make good on it.\n\n\nTolhurst thus ultimately reaches the verdict that his argument is\ninconclusive, and there are additional ways to question it besides that\nwhich invokes the idea of a special cognitive ability. For example, his\ntwo principles can be challenged with reference to the\n\u201cpermissivist\u201d view that the same set of evidence can\nlicense different doxastic attitudes toward a proposition (see, e.g.,\nWhite 2005 about permissivism). However, Tolhurst also makes some\nremarks about how to move forward which are of general interest. The\nupshot of those remarks is that the argument he developed should be\nassessed from a holistic perspective. The legitimacy of invoking a\nspecifically moral cognitive ability depends, he thinks, on\n\u201cwhether a realist theory which includes [that] hypothesis can,\nas a whole, explain moral [and non-moral] phenomena more effectively\nthan its antirealist rivals\u201d (621). This is an important\nobservation in view of that arguments from moral disagreement are often\nassessed under the assumption that they are expected to establish their\nskeptical or antirealist conclusions all by themselves and are\ndismissed if it is found that they fail to do so. What the holistic\napproach suggests, however, is that, even if they fail in that sense,\nit is still conceivable that they might contribute to a successful\ncombined challenge, by joining forces with other skeptical or\nantirealist arguments, such as the evolutionary debunking ones. (The\nevolutionary debunking strategy is described and discussed in\nFitzPatrick 2021. For an attempt to combine it with arguments from\ndisagreement, see Tersman 2017, but see also Klenk 2018 for a\ncritique.)\n",
