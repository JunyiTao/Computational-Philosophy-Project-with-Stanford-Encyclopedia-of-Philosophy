    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophical reflection on religion is as old as Greek questions\nabout Hebrew stories. Feminist philosophy of religion is a more recent\ndevelopment within Western philosophy that poses feminist questions\nabout religious texts, traditions, and practices, often with the aim\nof critiquing, redefining, or reconstructing the entire field in light\nof gender studies. Feminist philosophy of religion is important to\nfeminist and nonfeminist philosophy alike for providing a critical\nunderstanding of various religious concepts, beliefs, and rituals, as\nwell as of religion as a cultural institution that defines, sanctions,\nand sometimes challenges gender roles and gender-inflected\nrepresentations. It is equally important for feminist theory, which\nfrequently neglects the academic study of religion, as for analytic\nphilosophy of religion, which seldom takes into account gender or race\nor class. This entry considers the work of both critique and\nreconstruction as it has developed in feminist philosophies of\nreligion over the last several decades.\n\nIn the present situation, most practitioners of feminist philosophy of\nreligion and of feminist theology are agreed that their discipline\ncannot be limited simply to a sociological assessment or confessional\nnarrative of what a particular religious group believes to be true,\nwithout consideration of the difference that gender makes. Because\nfeminist philosophy of religion is philosophical, it can take\nas primary neither the datum of scriptures believed to be revealed and\nself-authenticating nor the self-privileging endeavor of intratextual\ntheologies. Because it is philosophy of religion, a subject\nmatter that encompasses a broad array of cross-cultural material, it\ncannot be concerned simply with themes or questions drawn from the\nChristian religion alone. And because it is feminist, it must\npromote the elimination of gender inequality and take into account the\nmultiplicity of human bodies, desires, and differences that are mapped\nonto the site of religion. At the same time, it cannot presume that\nreligion exists as some common universal underlying all the various\ntraditions; only particular religions exist, and even the very concept\nof religion itself has come to be recognized as a modern and Western\nconcept.\n",
