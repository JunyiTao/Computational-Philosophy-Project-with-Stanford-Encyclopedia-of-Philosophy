    "preamble": "\n\nThe 17th Century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes is now\nwidely regarded as one of a handful of truly great political\nphilosophers, whose masterwork Leviathan rivals in\nsignificance the political writings of Plato, Aristotle, Locke,\nRousseau, Kant, and Rawls. Hobbes is famous for his early and\nelaborate development of what has come to be known as \u201csocial\ncontract theory\u201d, the method of justifying political principles\nor arrangements by appeal to the agreement that would be made among\nsuitably situated rational, free, and equal persons. He is infamous\nfor having used the social contract method to arrive at the\nastonishing conclusion that we ought to submit to the authority of an\nabsolute\u2014undivided and unlimited\u2014sovereign power. While\nhis methodological innovation had a profound constructive impact on\nsubsequent work in political philosophy, his substantive conclusions\nhave served mostly as a foil for the development of more palatable\nphilosophical positions. Hobbes\u2019s moral philosophy has been less\ninfluential than his political philosophy, in part because that theory\nis too ambiguous to have garnered any general consensus as to its\ncontent. Most scholars have taken Hobbes to have affirmed some sort of\npersonal relativism or subjectivism; but views that Hobbes espoused\ndivine command theory, virtue ethics, rule egoism, or a form of\nprojectivism also find support in Hobbes\u2019s texts and among\nscholars. Because Hobbes held that \u201cthe true doctrine of the\nLawes of Nature is the true Morall philosophie\u201d, differences in\ninterpretation of Hobbes\u2019s moral philosophy can be traced to\ndiffering understandings of the status and operation of Hobbes\u2019s\n\u201claws of nature\u201d, which laws will be discussed below. The\nformerly dominant view that Hobbes espoused psychological egoism as\nthe foundation of his moral theory is currently widely rejected, and\nthere has been to date no fully systematic study of Hobbes\u2019s\nmoral psychology.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Major Political Writings\n\nHobbes wrote several versions of his political philosophy, including\nThe Elements of Law, Natural and Politic (also under the\ntitles Human Nature and De Corpore Politico)\npublished in 1650, De Cive (1642) published in English as\nPhilosophical Rudiments Concerning Government and Society in\n1651, the English Leviathan published in 1651, and its Latin\nrevision in 1668. Others of his works are also important in\nunderstanding his political philosophy, especially his history of the\nEnglish Civil War, Behemoth (published 1679), De\nCorpore (1655), De Homine (1658), Dialogue Between a\nPhilosopher and a Student of the Common Laws of England (1681),\nand The Questions Concerning Liberty, Necessity, and Chance\n(1656). All of Hobbes\u2019s major writings are collected in The\nEnglish Works of Thomas Hobbes, edited by Sir William Molesworth\n(11 volumes, London 1839\u201345), and Thomae Hobbes Opera\nPhilosophica Quae Latina Scripsit Omnia, also edited by\nMolesworth (5 volumes; London, 1839\u201345). Oxford University Press\nhas undertaken a projected 26 volume collection of the Clarendon\nEdition of the Works of Thomas Hobbes. So far 3 volumes are\navailable: De Cive (edited by Howard Warrender), The\nCorrespondence of Thomas Hobbes (edited by Noel Malcolm), and\nWritings on Common Law and Hereditary Right (edited by Alan\nCromartie and Quentin Skinner). Recently Noel Malcolm has published a\nthree volume edition of Leviathan, which places the English\ntext side by side with Hobbes\u2019s later Latin version of it.\nReaders new to Hobbes should begin with Leviathan, being sure\nto read Parts Three and Four, as well as the more familiar and often\nexcerpted Parts One and Two. There are many fine overviews of\nHobbes\u2019s normative philosophy, some of which are listed in the\nfollowing selected bibliography of secondary works.\n2. The Philosophical Project\n\nHobbes sought to discover rational principles for the construction of\na civil polity that would not be subject to destruction from within.\nHaving lived through the period of political disintegration\nculminating in the English Civil War, he came to the view that the\nburdens of even the most oppressive government are \u201cscarce\nsensible, in respect of the miseries, and horrible calamities, that\naccompany a Civill Warre\u201d. Because virtually any government\nwould be better than a civil war, and, according to Hobbes\u2019s\nanalysis, all but absolute governments are systematically prone to\ndissolution into civil war, people ought to submit themselves to an\nabsolute political authority. Continued stability will require that\nthey also refrain from the sorts of actions that might undermine such\na regime. For example, subjects should not dispute the sovereign power\nand under no circumstances should they rebel. In general, Hobbes aimed\nto demonstrate the reciprocal relationship between political obedience\nand peace.\n3. The State of Nature\n\nTo establish these conclusions, Hobbes invites us to consider what\nlife would be like in a state of nature, that is, a condition without\ngovernment. Perhaps we would imagine that people might fare best in\nsuch a state, where each decides for herself how to act, and is judge,\njury and executioner in her own case whenever disputes arise\u2014and\nthat at any rate, this state is the appropriate baseline against which\nto judge the justifiability of political arrangements. Hobbes terms\nthis situation \u201cthe condition of mere nature\u201d, a state of\nperfectly private judgment, in which there is no agency with\nrecognized authority to arbitrate disputes and effective power to\nenforce its decisions.\n\nHobbes\u2019s near descendant, John Locke, insisted in his Second\nTreatise of Government that the state of nature was indeed to be\npreferred to subjection to the arbitrary power of an absolute\nsovereign. But Hobbes famously argued that such a \u201cdissolute\ncondition of masterlesse men, without subjection to Lawes, and a\ncoercive Power to tye their hands from rapine, and revenge\u201d\nwould make impossible all of the basic security upon which\ncomfortable, sociable, civilized life depends. There would be\n\u201cno place for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain;\nand consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of\nthe commodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building;\nno Instruments of moving and removing such things as require much\nforce; no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no\nArts; no Letters; and which is worst of all, continuall feare, and\ndanger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty,\nbrutish, and short.\u201d If this is the state of nature, people have\nstrong reasons to avoid it, which can be done only by submitting to\nsome mutually recognized public authority, for \u201cso long a man is\nin the condition of mere nature, (which is a condition of war,) as\nprivate appetite is the measure of good and evill.\u201d\n\nAlthough many readers have criticized Hobbes\u2019s state of nature\nas unduly pessimistic, he constructs it from a number of individually\nplausible empirical and normative assumptions. He assumes that people\nare sufficiently similar in their mental and physical attributes that\nno one is invulnerable nor can expect to be able to dominate the\nothers. Hobbes assumes that people generally \u201cshun death\u201d,\nand that the desire to preserve their own lives is very strong in most\npeople. While people have local affections, their benevolence is\nlimited, and they have a tendency to partiality. Concerned that others\nshould agree with their own high opinions of themselves, people are\nsensitive to slights. They make evaluative judgments, but often use\nseemingly impersonal terms like \u2018good\u2019 and\n\u2018bad\u2019 to stand for their own personal preferences. They\nare curious about the causes of events, and anxious about their\nfutures; according to Hobbes, these characteristics incline people to\nadopt religious beliefs, although the content of those beliefs will\ndiffer depending upon the sort of religious education one has happened\nto receive.\n\nWith respect to normative assumptions, Hobbes ascribes to each person\nin the state of nature a liberty right to preserve herself, which he\nterms \u201cthe right of nature\u201d. This is the right to do\nwhatever one sincerely judges needful for one\u2019s preservation;\nyet because it is at least possible that virtually anything might be\njudged necessary for one\u2019s preservation, this theoretically\nlimited right of nature becomes in practice an unlimited right to\npotentially anything, or, as Hobbes puts it, a right \u201cto all\nthings\u201d. Hobbes further assumes as a principle of practical\nrationality, that people should adopt what they see to be the\nnecessary means to their most important ends.\n4. The State of Nature Is a State of War\n\nTaken together, these plausible descriptive and normative assumptions\nyield a state of nature potentially fraught with divisive struggle.\nThe right of each to all things invites serious conflict, especially\nif there is competition for resources, as there will surely be over at\nleast scarce goods such as the most desirable lands, spouses, etc.\nPeople will quite naturally fear that others may (citing the right of\nnature) invade them, and may rationally plan to strike first as an\nanticipatory defense. Moreover, that minority of prideful or\n\u201cvain-glorious\u201d persons who take pleasure in exercising\npower over others will naturally elicit preemptive defensive responses\nfrom others. Conflict will be further fueled by disagreement in\nreligious views, in moral judgments, and over matters as mundane as\nwhat goods one actually needs, and what respect one properly merits.\nHobbes imagines a state of nature in which each person is free to\ndecide for herself what she needs, what she\u2019s owed, what\u2019s\nrespectful, right, pious, prudent, and also free to decide all of\nthese questions for the behavior of everyone else as well, and to act\non her judgments as she thinks best, enforcing her views where she\ncan. In this situation where there is no common authority to resolve\nthese many and serious disputes, we can easily imagine with Hobbes\nthat the state of nature would become a \u201cstate of war\u201d,\neven worse, a war of \u201call against all\u201d.\n5. Further Questions About the State of Nature\n\nIn response to the natural question whether humanity ever was\ngenerally in any such state of nature, Hobbes gives three examples of\nputative states of nature. First, he notes that all sovereigns are in\nthis state with respect to one another. This claim has made Hobbes the\nrepresentative example of a \u201crealist\u201d in international\nrelations. Second, he opined that many now civilized peoples were\nformerly in that state, and some few peoples\u2014\u201cthe savage\npeople in many places of America\u201d (Leviathan, XIII),\nfor instance\u2014were still to his day in the state of nature. Third\nand most significantly, Hobbes asserts that the state of nature will\nbe easily recognized by those whose formerly peaceful states have\ncollapsed into civil war. While the state of nature\u2019s condition\nof perfectly private judgment is an abstraction, something resembling\nit too closely for comfort remains a perpetually present possibility,\nto be feared, and avoided.\n\nDo the other assumptions of Hobbes\u2019s philosophy license the\nexistence of this imagined state of isolated individuals pursuing\ntheir private judgments? Probably not, since, as feminist critics\namong others have noted, children are by Hobbes\u2019s theory assumed\nto have undertaken an obligation of obedience to their parents in\nexchange for nurturing, and so the primitive units in the state of\nnature will include families ordered by internal obligations, as well\nas individuals. The bonds of affection, sexual affinity, and\nfriendship\u2014as well as of clan membership and shared religious\nbelief\u2014may further decrease the accuracy of any purely\nindividualistic model of the state of nature. This concession need not\nimpugn Hobbes\u2019s analysis of conflict in the state of nature,\nsince it may turn out that competition, diffidence and glory-seeking\nare disastrous sources of conflicts among small groups just as much as\nthey are among individuals. Still, commentators seeking to answer the\nquestion how precisely we should understand Hobbes\u2019s state of\nnature are investigating the degree to which Hobbes imagines that to\nbe a condition of interaction among isolated individuals.\n\nAnother important open question is that of what, exactly, it is about\nhuman beings that makes it the case (supposing Hobbes is right) that\nour communal life is prone to disaster when we are left to interact\naccording only to our own individual judgments. Perhaps, while people\ndo wish to act for their own best long-term interest, they are\nshortsighted, and so indulge their current interests without properly\nconsidering the effects of their current behavior on their long-term\ninterest. This would be a type of failure of rationality.\nAlternatively, it may be that people in the state of nature are fully\nrational, but are trapped in a situation that makes it individually\nrational for each to act in a way that is sub-optimal for all, perhaps\nfinding themselves in the familiar \u2018prisoner\u2019s\ndilemma\u2019 of game theory. Or again, it may be that Hobbes\u2019s\nstate of nature would be peaceful but for the presence of persons\n(just a few, or perhaps all, to some degree) whose passions overrule\ntheir calmer judgments; who are prideful, spiteful, partial, envious,\njealous, and in other ways prone to behave in ways that lead to war.\nSuch an account would understand irrational human passions to be the\nsource of conflict. Which, if any, of these accounts adequately\nanswers to Hobbes\u2019s text is a matter of continuing debate among\nHobbes scholars. Game theorists have been particularly active in these\ndebates, experimenting with different models for the state of nature\nand the conflict it engenders.\n6. The Laws of Nature\n\nHobbes argues that the state of nature is a miserable state of war in\nwhich none of our important human ends are reliably realizable.\nHappily, human nature also provides resources to escape this miserable\ncondition. Hobbes argues that each of us, as a rational being, can see\nthat a war of all against all is inimical to the satisfaction of her\ninterests, and so can agree that \u201cpeace is good, and therefore\nalso the way or means of peace are good\u201d. Humans will recognize\nas imperatives the injunction to seek peace, and to do those things\nnecessary to secure it, when they can do so safely. Hobbes calls these\npractical imperatives \u201cLawes of Nature\u201d, the sum of which\nis not to treat others in ways we would not have them treat us. These\n\u201cprecepts\u201d, \u201cconclusions\u201d or\n\u201ctheorems\u201d of reason are \u201ceternal and\nimmutable\u201d, always commanding our assent even when they may not\nsafely be acted upon. They forbid many familiar vices such as\niniquity, cruelty, and ingratitude. Although commentators do not agree\non whether these laws should be regarded as mere precepts of prudence,\nor rather as divine commands, or moral imperatives of some other sort,\nall agree that Hobbes understands them to direct people to submit to\npolitical authority. They tell us to seek peace with willing others by\nlaying down part of our \u201cright to all things\u201d, by mutually\ncovenanting to submit to the authority of a sovereign, and further\ndirect us to keep that covenant establishing sovereignty.\n7. Establishing Sovereign Authority\n\nWhen people mutually covenant each to the others to obey a common\nauthority, they have established what Hobbes calls \u201csovereignty\nby institution\u201d. When, threatened by a conqueror, they covenant\nfor protection by promising obedience, they have established\n\u201csovereignty by acquisition\u201d. These are equally legitimate\nways of establishing sovereignty, according to Hobbes, and their\nunderlying motivation is the same\u2014namely fear\u2014whether of\none\u2019s fellows or of a conqueror. The social covenant involves\nboth the renunciation or transfer of right and the authorization of\nthe sovereign power. Political legitimacy depends not on how a\ngovernment came to power, but only on whether it can effectively\nprotect those who have consented to obey it; political obligation ends\nwhen protection ceases.\n8. Absolutism\n\nAlthough Hobbes offered some mild pragmatic grounds for preferring\nmonarchy to other forms of government, his main concern was to argue\nthat effective government\u2014whatever its form\u2014must have\nabsolute authority. Its powers must be neither divided nor limited.\nThe powers of legislation, adjudication, enforcement, taxation,\nwar-making (and the less familiar right of control of normative\ndoctrine) are connected in such a way that a loss of one may thwart\neffective exercise of the rest; for example, legislation without\ninterpretation and enforcement will not serve to regulate conduct.\nOnly a government that possesses all of what Hobbes terms the\n\u201cessential rights of sovereignty\u201d can be reliably\neffective, since where partial sets of these rights are held by\ndifferent bodies that disagree in their judgments as to what is to be\ndone, paralysis of effective government, or degeneration into a civil\nwar to settle their dispute, may occur.\n\nSimilarly, to impose limitation on the authority of the government is\nto invite irresoluble disputes over whether it has overstepped those\nlimits. If each person is to decide for herself whether the government\nshould be obeyed, factional disagreement\u2014and war to settle the\nissue, or at least paralysis of effective government\u2014are quite\npossible. To refer resolution of the question to some further\nauthority, itself also limited and so open to challenge for\noverstepping its bounds, would be to initiate an infinite regress of\nnon-authoritative \u2018authorities\u2019 (where the buck never\nstops). To refer it to a further authority itself unlimited, would be\njust to relocate the seat of absolute sovereignty, a position entirely\nconsistent with Hobbes\u2019s insistence on absolutism. To avoid the\nhorrible prospect of governmental collapse and return to the state of\nnature, people should treat their sovereign as having absolute\nauthority.\n9. Responsibility and the Limits of Political Obligation\n\nWhen subjects institute a sovereign by authorizing it, they agree, in\nconformity with the principle \u201cno wrong is done to a consenting\nparty\u201d, not to hold it liable for any errors in judgment it may\nmake and not to treat any harms it does to them as actionable\ninjustices. Although many interpreters have assumed that by\nauthorizing a sovereign, subjects become morally responsible for the\nactions it commands, Hobbes instead insists that \u201cthe external\nactions done in obedience to [laws], without the inward approbation,\nare the actions of the sovereign, and not of the subject, which is in\nthat case but as an instrument, without any motion of his own at\nall\u201d (Leviathan xlii, 106). It may be important to\nHobbes\u2019s project of persuading his Christian readers to obey\ntheir sovereign that he can reassure them that God will not hold them\nresponsible for wrongful actions done at the sovereign\u2019s\ncommand, because they cannot reasonably be expected to obey if doing\nso would jeopardize their eternal prospects. Hence Hobbes explains\nthat \u201cwhatsoever a subject...is compelled to do in obedience to\nhis sovereign, and doth it not in order to his own mind, but in order\nto the laws of his country, that action is not his, but his\nsovereign\u2019s.\u201d (Leviathan xlii. 11) This position\nreinforces absolutism by permitting Hobbes to maintain that subjects\ncan obey even commands to perform actions they believe to be sinful\nwithout fear of divine punishment.\n\nHobbes\u2019s description of the way in which persons should be\nunderstood to become subjects to a sovereign authority changes from\nhis Elements and De Cive accounts to his\nLeviathan account. In the former, each person lays down their\nrights (of self-government and to pursue all things they judge useful\nor necessary for their survival and commodious living) in favor of one\nand the same sovereign person (whether a natural person, as a monarch,\nor an artificial person, as a rule-governed assembly). In these\nearlier accounts, sovereigns alone retain their right of nature to act\non their own private judgment in all matters, and also exercise the\ntransferred rights of subjects. Whether exercising its own retained\nright of nature or the subjects\u2019 transferred rights, the\nsovereign\u2019s action is attributable to the sovereign itself, and\nit bears moral responsibility for it. In contrast, Hobbes\u2019s\nLeviathan account has each individual covenanting to\n\u201cown and authorize\u201d all of the sovereign\u2019s\nactions\u2014whatever the sovereign does as a public figure or\ncommands that subjects do. This change creates an apparent\ninconsistency in Hobbes\u2019s theory of responsibility for actions\ndone at the sovereign\u2019s command; if in \u201cowning\nand authorizing\u201d all their sovereign\u2019s actions, subjects\nbecome morally responsible for all that it does and all they do in\nobedience to its commands, Hobbes cannot consistently maintain his\nposition that merely obedient actions in response to sovereign\ncommands are the moral responsibility of the sovereign alone. One\nresolution of this apparent inconsistency denies that Hobbes\u2019s\nidea of authorization carries along responsibility for the act\nauthorized, as our contemporary idea of authorization generally does.\n\n\nWhile Hobbes insists that we should regard our governments as having\nabsolute authority, he reserves to subjects the liberty of disobeying\nsome of their government\u2019s commands. He argues that subjects\nretain a right of self-defense against the sovereign power, giving\nthem the right to disobey or resist when their lives are in danger. He\nalso gives them seemingly broad resistance rights in cases in which\ntheir families or even their honor are at stake. These exceptions have\nunderstandably intrigued those who study Hobbes. His ascription of\napparently inalienable rights\u2014what he calls the \u201ctrue\nliberties of subjects\u201d\u2014seems incompatible with his defense\nof absolute sovereignty. Moreover, if the sovereign\u2019s failure to\nprovide adequate protection to subjects extinguishes their obligation\nto obey, and if it is left to each subject to judge for herself the\nadequacy of that protection, it seems that people have never really\nexited the fearsome state of nature. This aspect of Hobbes\u2019s\npolitical philosophy has been hotly debated ever since Hobbes\u2019s\ntime. Bishop Bramhall, one of Hobbes\u2019s contemporaries, famously\naccused Leviathan of being a \u201cRebell\u2019s\nCatechism.\u201d More recently, some commentators have argued that\nHobbes\u2019s discussion of the limits of political obligation is the\nAchilles\u2019 heel of his theory. It is not clear whether or not\nthis charge can stand up to scrutiny, but it will surely be the\nsubject of much continued discussion.\n10. Religion and Social Instability\n\nThe last crucial aspect of Hobbes\u2019s political philosophy is his\ntreatment of religion. Hobbes progressively expands his discussion of\nChristian religion in each revision of his political philosophy, until\nit comes in Leviathan to comprise roughly half the book.\nThere is no settled consensus on how Hobbes understands the\nsignificance of religion within his political theory. Some\ncommentators have argued that Hobbes is trying to demonstrate to his\nreaders the compatibility of his political theory with core Christian\ncommitments, since it may seem that Christians\u2019 religious duties\nforbid their affording the sort of absolute obedience to their\ngovernors which Hobbes\u2019s theory requires of them. Others have\ndoubted the sincerity of his professed Christianity, arguing that by\nthe use of irony or other subtle rhetorical devices, Hobbes sought to\nundermine his readers\u2019 religious beliefs. Howsoever his\nintentions are properly understood, Hobbes\u2019s obvious concern\nwith the power of religious belief is a fact that interpreters of his\npolitical philosophy must seek to explain.\n11. Hobbes on Gender and Race\n\nScholars are increasingly interested in how Hobbes thought of the\nstatus of women, and of the family. Hobbes was one of the earliest\nwestern philosophers to count women as persons when devising a social\ncontract among persons. He insists on the equality of all people, very\nexplicitly including women. People are equal because they are all\nsubject to domination, and all potentially capable of dominating\nothers. No person is so strong as to be invulnerable to attack while\nsleeping by the concerted efforts of others, nor is any so strong as\nto be assured of dominating all others.\n\nIn this relevant sense, women are naturally equal to men. They are\nequally naturally free, meaning that their consent is required before\nthey will be under the authority of anyone else. In this,\nHobbes\u2019s claims stand in stark contrast to many prevailing views\nof the time, according to which women were born inferior to and\nsubordinate to men. Sir Robert Filmer, who later served as the target\nof John Locke\u2019s First Treatise of Government, is a\nwell-known proponent of this view, which he calls patriarchalism.\nExplicitly rejecting the patriarchalist view as well as Salic law,\nHobbes maintains that women can be sovereigns; authority for him is\n\u201cneither male nor female\u201d. He also argues for natural\nmaternal right: in the state of nature, dominion over children\nnaturally belongs to the mother. He adduced the example of the Amazon\nwarrior women as evidence.\n\nIn seeming contrast to this egalitarian foundation, Hobbes spoke of\nthe commonwealth in patriarchal language. In the move from the state\nof nature to civil society, families are described as\n\u201cfathers\u201d, \u201cservants\u201d, and\n\u201cchildren\u201d, seemingly obliterating mothers from the\npicture entirely. Hobbes justifies this way of talking by saying that\nit is fathers not mothers who have founded societies. As true as that\nis, it is easy to see how there is a lively debate between those who\nemphasize the potentially feminist or egalitarian aspects of\nHobbes\u2019s thought and those who emphasize his ultimate exclusion\nof women. Such debates raise the question: To what extent are the\npatriarchal claims Hobbes makes integral to his overall theory, if\nindeed they are integral at all?\n\nWe find similar ambiguities and tensions in what Hobbes says about\nrace (or what we would now call race). On the one hand, he invokes the\n\u201csavages\u201d of the Americas to illustrate the\n\u201cbrutish\u201d conditions of life in the state of nature. On\nthe other hand, when he simply denies that there are innate or\nimmutable differences between Native Americans and Europeans.\nSocieties which have enjoyed scientific advancement have done so,\naccording to Hobbes, because of the existence of \u201cleisure\ntime,\u201d and if that is \u201csupposed away,\u201d he asks\nrhetorically, \u201cwhat do we differ from the wildest of the\nIndians?\u201d\n",
