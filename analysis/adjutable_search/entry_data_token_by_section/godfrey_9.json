Substance, Accidents, Human Action\n\n\nIn Quodlibet XIV, q. 5 Godfrey contrasts mental being with\nextramental being and then divides the latter into being per\nse and being per accidens. Being per se is\ndivided into substance and the nine genera of accidents. The latter may\nbe regarded as real modes of substance or of being in the unqualified\nsense (ens simpliciter). As Godfrey indicates elsewhere, a\nsubstance enjoys a separate being or exists in itself, while it is of\nthe nature of an accident to be ordered to and to exist in something\nelse. An accident is not so much a being as \u201cof a being\u201d (PB 5.427) For\npractical purposes Godfrey accepts the number of predicaments as ten,\nbut indicates that determination of their precise number is a matter of\nprobability rather than certainty (Wippel, 1981, 174\u201375). For Godfrey\nsubstance and accident are related as potency and act since substance\nserves as a subject for its accidents. Because of this he denies that\nany substance can be the efficient cause of the accidents that inhere\nin it, for it would then be in act with respect to them (as their\nefficient cause) and in potency (as receiving them) at one and the same\ntime. He would always insist that nothing can be in act and in potency\nat one and the same time with respect to the same thing for this would\nbe to assign being and nonbeing to it simultaneously. He also holds\nagainst many of his contemporaries that the powers of the soul are\nreally distinct from the essence of the soul and from one another\n(Wippel, 1981, 176\u201384, 202\u20137).\nAn unusual theory to account for the increase or decrease in the\nintensity of an accidental quality such as the whiteness of an object\nor an increase or decrease of charity in the human soul was attributed\nto Godfrey by medieval critics of this view such as John Duns Scotus\nor a few years later (ca. 1323) by Walter Burley as well as by many\nothers. According to this position, when such a quality increases or\ndecreases in intensity, the previous quality is completely corrupted\nand replaced by a newly generated and numerically distinct\nquality. There is a textual problem concerning Godfrey\u2019s personal\nposition because his explicit discussion of this in his Disputed\nQuestion 18 is incomplete in the two known surviving manuscripts that\ncontain it.  Modern scholars are divided about the accuracy of the\nattribution of this view to Godfrey. Anneliese Maier (Maier, 2nd ed.,\n1951, 3rd rev. ed., 1968) and John Wippel (Wippel,1979) challenged the\nreliability of this attribution. Edith Dudley Sylla published an\narticle dealing with Godfrey\u2019s explanation of changes in the quantity\nof the Eucharistic species after transubstantiation which, she\nmaintained, indicated that Godfrey defended a similar \u201csuccession\ntheory\u201d to account for changes in quantity, and suggested that this\nmay have led Scotus to attribute to him the succession theory in\nchanges of qualities (Sylla, 1981). More recently, in two jointly\nauthored studies Jean Celeyrette and Jean-Luc Sol\u00e8re argue that\nGodfrey did indeed defend the succession theory in accounting for\nincreases or decreases in qualities (Ceyerlette and Sol\u00e8re,\n2002, 2009). Stephen Dumont has recently published a lengthy study\ndrawing upon discussions by Scotus, Burley, and many other medieval\nwriters to support this claim as well (Dumont, 2009). In light of\nthese recent and well documented contributions, I myself would\ncertainly grant that Godfrey could have defended such a position, and\neven that he may have done so, but in the absence of any known text in\nwhich he explicitly and clearly defends this position, I do not think\nthat this has yet been conclusively demonstrated. One hopes that one\nday the complete text of his Disputed Question 18 will be found in\nsome manuscript, and that then the historical issue can be\ndefinitively resolved. Until that happens I would recommend a healthy\nskepticism about this issue, even as one of the texts cited by Dumont,\ntaken from a known critic of Godfrey\u2019s views on many points (Bernard\nof Auvergne), expresses doubt concerning whether Godfrey really held\nthis position, and rejects it if indeed he did, but not if Godfrey was\nreferring to different degrees of a quallty rather than to different\nqualities themselves in such changes (Dumont, 2009, 80, 118).\n\n    \n\nIf the soul\u2019s immanent operations such as thinking or willing inhere\nin their respective powers, the intellect and the will, those powers\nthemselves cannot be the efficient causes of such acts. Against Henry\nof Ghent and later in Quodlibet XV against the Franciscan Gonsalvus of\nSpain, Godfrey denies that any exception can be made to the\nact-potency axiom. Therefore the will cannot reduce itself from potency to act\nor immediately efficiently cause its acts of volition. The efficient\ncause of volition can only be the object presented to the will by the\nintellect. Against the charge of intellectual determinism sometimes\nattributed to this position by its critics, Godfrey grounds human\nfreedom in the radical indeterminacy, he even speaks of the freedom,\nof the intellect itself.  And in his final Quodlibet XV, q. 4, he\nargues that if, per impossibile, the will could move itself\ndirectly without being moved by its object, freedom would be less well\npreserved than if one maintains with him that the will is moved by its\nobject and then moves the apprehensive powers to their respective acts\nand, by means of such motions, indirectly moves itself with respect to\nsecondary objects of volition (PB 14.20\u201323; Putallaz, 1995,\n184\u201387, 198\u2013208, 233\u201347; Kent, 1995,\n108\u20139, 141\u201342; Osborne, 2015; Hartman, 2014). \n\nIn Quodlibet VII, q.5 Godfrey was asked whether a supposit (a concrete existing subject) adds any reality (res) to essence or nature. He maintains that in terms of their primary meaning or denotation, supposit and nature are really one\nand the same, but in terms of its connotation, the term \u2018supposit\u2019\nsignifies something more than does the term \u2018nature\u2019, that is, those\naccidents without which a supposit would not exist in the concrete\norder, and the exclusion of dependence upon another subject or center\nof existence. This has important implications for his theological\ndiscussion of the union of human nature and a divine person in Christ\naccording to Christian faith (Wippel, 1981, 227\u201346; Cross, 2002, 69\u201370, 114\u201319, 290\u201395)\n",
