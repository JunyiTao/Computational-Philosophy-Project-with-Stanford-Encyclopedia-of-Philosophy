Argumentation and dialogue are basic notions\nfor logic. Both can be studied using techniques and results from game\ntheory (Lorenzen & Lorenz 1978; Hamblin\n1970). In this perspective, logical validity of consequence\nrests on there being a winning strategy for a Proponent claiming the\nconclusion against an Opponent granting the premises in a game where\nmoves are regulated by the logical constants. Many games have found\nuses in modern logic since the 1950s, with\nEhrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9 games for model comparison being a\nparadigmatic example. Besides these, also semantic verification or\nmodel construction can be cast as\n natural logic games.\n\nThis raises an intricate issue within in the philosophy of logic,\nconcerning the nature of logic and in particular that of logical\nconstants. A \u2018weak thesis\u2019 would hold that games\nconstitute a natural technique for analyzing logical notions, as well\nas a didactic tool for teaching logic that appeals directly to vivid\nintuitions. Parts of the literature, however, also defend a\n\u2018strong thesis\u2019, suggesting that the primary semantics of\ncertain logical systems may be procedural and game-theoretic, rather\nthan denotational in a standard sense. This perspective, sometimes\ncalled \u2018logic as games\u2019, occurs in some attractive\nsemantics for first-order languages (Hintikka\n& Sandu 1997), as well as in\n game semantics for programming languages.\n\nThe theme of logic as games will appear only briefly in the present\nentry, which is mainly directed toward logics of games.\n Section 6\n will discuss which questions arise from joining both perspectives on\nthe interface of logic and games.\n\nAs it happens, the logic-as-games perspective is of broader relevance.\nLogic games were originally designed for particular tasks inside\nlogic. Yet, taken to reality, they can help analyze or streamline\nactual lines of argumentation. As such they may be compared to\ndesigned parlor games that challenge reasoning skills. A game like\nClue involves an intriguing mix of logical deduction, new\ninformation from drawing cards or public observation of moves, but\nalso private communication acts by players (van\nDitmarsch 2000). Other parlor games, such as Nine Men\nMorris (Gasser 1996) are graph\ngames (Gr\u00e4del, Thomas, & Wilke\n2002) with added chance moves that serve to diminish the risk\nof finding a repeatable simple strategy on the fixed board. The\nlogical study of playable designed games for bounded agents, and the\ndesign of new such games, is a natural sequel to this entry (cf.\nvan Benthem & Liu 2019).\n",
