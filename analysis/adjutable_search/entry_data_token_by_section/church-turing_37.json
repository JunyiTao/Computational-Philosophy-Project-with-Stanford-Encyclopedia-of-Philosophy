At one point he explicitly drew\nattention to this usage:\n\n\nThe expression \u201cmachine process\u201d of course means one which\ncould be carried out by the type of machine I was considering [in\n\u201cOn Computable Numbers\u201d]. (Turing 1947 [2004:\n378\u20139])\n\n\nThus when, a few pages later, Turing asserted that \u201cmachine\nprocesses and rule of thumb processes are synonymous\u201d (1947\n[2004: 383]), he is to be understood as advancing the Church-Turing\nthesis (and its converse), not a version of the maximality thesis.\nUnless his intended usage is borne in mind, misunderstanding could\nensue. Especially liable to mislead are statements like the following,\nwhich a casual reader might mistake for a formulation of the\nmaximality thesis:\n\n\nThe importance of the universal machine is clear. We do not need to\nhave an infinity of different machines doing different jobs. A single\none will suffice. The engineering problem of producing various\nmachines for various jobs is replaced by the office work of\n\u201cprogramming\u201d the universal machine to do these jobs.\n(Turing 1948 [2004: 414])\n\n\nIn context it is perfectly clear that these remarks concern machines\nequivalent to Turing machines; the passage is embedded in a discussion\nof L.C.M.s.\n\nWhether or not Turing would, if queried, have assented to the weak\nmaximality thesis is unknown. There is certainly no textual evidence\nin favor of the view that he did so assent. The same is true of the\n Deutsch-Wolfram thesis\n and its cognates: there is no textual evidence that Turing would have\nassented to any such thesis.\n",
