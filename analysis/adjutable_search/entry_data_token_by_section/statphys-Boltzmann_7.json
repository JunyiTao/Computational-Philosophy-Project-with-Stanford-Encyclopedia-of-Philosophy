As we have seen, The H-theorem formed the basis of a\nrenewed claim by Boltzmann to have obtained a theorem corresponding to\nthe second law, at least for gases. A main difference with his\nprevious (1866) claim, is that he now strongly emphasized the role of\nprobability calculus in his derivation. Even so, it will be noted that\nhis conception of probability is still a fully mechanical one. Thus,\nthere is no conflict between his claims that on the one hand,\n\u201cthe problems of the mechanical theory of heat are really\nproblems in probability calculus\u201d and that the probabilities\nthemselves are \u201cderived on the basis of the equations of motion\nalone\u201d, on the other hand. Indeed, it seems to me that\nBoltzmann's emphasis on the crucial role of probability is only\nintended to convey that probability theory provides a particularly\nuseful and appropriate language for discussing mechanical problems in\ngas theory. There is no indication in this paper yet that probability\ntheory could play a role by furnishing assumptions of a non-mechanical\nnature, i.e., independent of the equations of motion. However, see\nBadino (2006, Other Internet Resources) for a very different point of\nview. \n\n\n2. Note that Boltzmann stresses the generality, rigor and\n\u201canalyticity\u201d of his proof. He put no emphasis on the special\nassumptions that go into the argument. Indeed,\nthe, Sto\u00dfzahlansatz commonly identified as the key\nassumption that is responsible for the time-asymmetry of the\nH-theorem, is announced as follows:\nThe determination [of the number of collisions] can only\nbe obtained in a truly tedious manner, by consideration of the\nrelative velocities of both particles. But since this consideration\nhas, apart from its tediousness, not the slightest difficulty, nor any\nspecial interest, and because the result is so simple that one might\nalmost say it is self-evident I will only state this result. (WA I,\n323)\nThis, is not an announcement that would alert his readers to the\ncrucial role of this assumption.\n\nStill, it thus seems natural that Boltzmann's contemporaries must have\nunderstood him as claiming that the H-theorem followed\nnecessarily from the dynamics of the mechanical gas model. Indeed this\nis exactly how Boltzmann's claims were understood.  For example, the\nrecommendation written in 1888 for his membership of the Prussian\nAcademy of Sciences mentions as Boltzmann's main feat that had proven\nthat, whatever its initial state, a gas must necessarily approach the\nMaxwellian distribution (Kirsten and K\u00f6rber 1975, 109). \n\nIs there then no evidence at all for von Plato's reading of the\npaper? Von Plato quotes a passage from Section II, where Boltzmann\nrepeats the previous analysis by assuming that energy can take on only\ndiscrete values, and replacing all integrals by sums. He recovers, of\ncourse, the same conclusion, but now adds a side remark, which touches\nupon the case of non-uniform gases:\nWhatever may have been the initial distribution of states,\nthere is one and only one distribution which will be approached in the\ncourse of time. [\u2026] This statement has been proved for the case\nthat the distribution of states was already initially uniform. It must\nalso be valid when this is not the case, i.e. when the molecules are\ninitially distributed in such a way that in the course of time they\nmix among themselves more and more, so that after a very long time the\ndistribution of states becomes uniform. This will always be the case,\nwith the exception of very special cases, e.g., when all molecules\nwere initially situated along a straight line, and were reflected by\nthe walls onto this line. (WA I, 358)\n\n True enough, Boltzmann in the above quote indicates that there are\nexceptions. But he mentions them only in connection with an\nextension of his results to the case when the gas is not\ninitially uniform, i.e., when condition (b) above is dropped.  There\ncan be no doubt that under the assumption of the conditions\n(a \u2013 c), Boltzmann claimed rigorous validity of the\nH-theorem.\n\n\n3. Note that Boltzmann misconstrues, or perhaps understates, the\nsignificance of his results. Both the Boltzmann equation and the\nH theorem refer to a body of gas in a fixed container that\nevolves in complete isolation from its environment. There is no\nquestion of heat being exchanged by the gas during a process, let\nalone in an irreversible cyclic process. His comparison with Clausius'\nintegral \\(\\int dQ/T\\) (i.e., \\(\\oint \\dbar Q/T\\) in modern notation)\nis therefore really completely out of place.\n\n\nThe true import of Boltzmann's results is rather that they provide a\ngeneralization of the entropy concept to non-equilibrium states, and a\nclaim that this non-equilibrium entropy \\(-kH\\) increases\nmonotonically as the isolated gas evolves from non-equilibrium towards\nan equilibrium state. The relationship with the second law is,\ntherefore, indirect. On the one hand, Boltzmann proves much more than\nwas required, since the second law does not speak of non-equilibrium\nentropy, nor of monotonic increase; on the other hand it proves also\nless, since Boltzmann does not consider more general adiabatic\nprocesses.\n",
