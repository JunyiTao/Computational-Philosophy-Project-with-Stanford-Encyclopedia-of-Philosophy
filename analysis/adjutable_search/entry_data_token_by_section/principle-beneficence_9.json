This principle\u2019s prominence is\nhistorically traceable to the publication of the Belmont\nReport in 1978 by The National Commission for the Protection of\nHuman Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. The Belmont\nReport has provided the basic moral framework for research ethics\nin the United States. This commission was established in 1974 by the\nU.S. Congress with a charge to discover and publish the basic\nprinciples of human research ethics and also to \"consider\" the\nboundaries between biomedical research and accepted medical practice.\nThe commission found that beneficence is one of only three basic\nprinciples of research ethics. This principle soon became and remains\ntoday one of three canonical principles in American research ethics\ngoverning research funded by the federal government.\n\n\nThe three basic principles are (1) respect for persons, (2)\nbeneficence, and (3) justice. In this context, the principle of\nbeneficence is understood as an abstract norm that includes derivative\nrules such as \"Do no harm,\" \"Balance benefits against risks,\" and\n\"Maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms.\" This\nprinciple is satisfied in the research context by intentionally\nrefraining from causing injury and by assuring that risks stand in\nreasonable relation to probable benefits. As one major demand of\nbeneficence, the National Commission required that during the course of\nthe ethical review of research protocols there be arrayals of data\npertaining to benefits and risks and of alternative ways of obtaining\nthe benefits (if any) sought in the research. It also demanded that\nsystematic and nonarbitrary presentations of risks and benefits be made\nto subjects, as part of the informed consent process, and that\nassessments of risks and safeguards be considered by ethics committees\nwhen they evaluate whether research protocols are justified.\nThe National Commission demanded that, to fulfill obligations of\nbeneficence, research subjects not be asked or allowed to consent to\nmore risk than is warranted by anticipated benefits and that forms of\nrisk incommensurate with participants\u2019 previous experience not be\nimposed in the case of groups such as children. The moral concern is\nthat some subjects, notably children, would be overburdened and\npossibly disturbed or terrified. However, the commission recognized\nthat risks must be permitted during the course of many forms of\nresearch, including pediatric research, in order for investigators to\nbe positioned to distinguish harmful from beneficial outcomes. Today,\nthe problem might be expressed in terms of the need for investigators\nto determine the safety or effectiveness of a therapy or diagnostic\ntool under investigation in a study.\nThis understanding of beneficence and its role in protecting human\nsubjects is deeply embedded at the core of research ethics in many\ncountries.\n",
