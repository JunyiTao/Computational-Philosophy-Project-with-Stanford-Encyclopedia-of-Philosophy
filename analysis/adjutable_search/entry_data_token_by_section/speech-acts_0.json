    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\n\nBertrand Russell\u2019s  Theory of Descriptions \nwas a paradigm for many philosophers in the twentieth century. One\nreason for this is that it suggested a way to respond to longstanding\nphilosophical problems by showing them to be specious. Russell argued\nthat such sentences as \u2018The present King of Singapore is\nbald,\u2019 and, \u2018The round square is impossible,\u2019\npossess superficial grammatical forms that are misleading as to their\nunderlying logical structure. In so doing he showed how such sentences\ncan be meaningful without this fact obliging us to posit current\nSingaporean monarchs or round squares. Many philosophers in what came\nto be known as the Ordinary Language movement were inspired by this\nachievement to argue that classic philosophical problems (e.g., of\nfree will, the relation of mind to body, truth, the nature of\nknowledge, and of right and wrong) likewise rested on a\nmisunderstanding of the language in which these problem are\ncouched. In How to Do Things with Words,\n J.L. Austin for instance writes,\n\n\u2026in recent years, many things which would once have been\naccepted without question as \u2018statements\u2019 by both\nphilosophers and grammarians have been scrutinized with new\ncare\u2026 It has come to be commonly held that many utterances\nwhich look like statements are either not intended at all, or only\nintended in part, to record or impart straightforward information\nabout the facts\u2026Along these lines it has by now been shown\npiecemeal, or at least made to look likely, that many traditional\nphilosophical perplexities have arisen through a mistake-the mistake\nof taking as straightforward statements of fact utterances which are\neither (in interesting non-grammatical ways)\nnonsensical or else intended as something quite different. Whatever we\nmay think of any particular one of these views and\nsuggestions\u2026it cannot be doubted that they are producing a\nrevolution in philosophy. (Austin 1962, pp. 1\u20132)\n\n\nThe Ordinary Language movement, with its broad claim that the meaning\nof an expression should be equated with its use, and its desire to\ntranscend traditional philosophical perplexities, did not achieve the\nrevolution of which Austin speaks. Nonetheless one of its enduring\nlegacies is the notion of a speech act.\n\nOne way of appreciating the distinctive features of speech acts is in\ncontrast with other well-established phenomena within the philosophy\nof language and linguistics. Accordingly in this entry we will\nconsider the relations among speech acts and: semantic content,\ngrammatical mood, speaker-meaning, logically perfect languages,\nperlocutions,\nperformatives, presuppositions,\nand implicature. This will enable us to\nsituate speech acts within their ecological niche.\n",
