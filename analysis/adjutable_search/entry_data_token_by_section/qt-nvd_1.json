Von Neumann and the Foundations of Quantum Theory\n\nIn the late 1920s, von Neumann developed the separable Hilbert space\nformulation of quantum mechanics, which later became the definitive\none (from the standpoint of mathematical rigor, at least). In the\nmid-1930s, he worked extensively on lattice theory (see the entry on\n quantum logic),\n rings of operators, and continuous geometries. Part of his expressed\nmotivation for developing these mathematical theories was to develop\nan appropriate framework for QFT and a better foundation for quantum\nmechanics. During this time, he noted two closely related structures,\nmodular lattices and finite type-II factors (a special type of ring of\noperators), that have what he regarded as desirable features for\nquantum theory. These observations led to his developing a more\ngeneral framework, continuous geometries, for quantum theory. Matters\ndid not work out as von Neumann had expected. He soon realized that\nsuch geometries must have a transition probability function, if they\nare to be used to describe quantum mechanical phenomena, and that the\nresulting structure is not a generalization at all beyond the operator\nrings that were already available. Moreover, it was determined much\nlater that the type-III factors are the most important type of ring of\noperators for quantum theory. In addition, a similar verdict was\ndelivered much later with regards to his expectations concerning\nlattice theory. The lattices that are appropriate for quantum theory\nare orthomodular \u2013 a lattice is orthomodular only if it is\nmodular, but the converse is false. Of the three mathematical\ntheories, it is the rings of operators that have proven to be the most\nimportant framework for quantum theory. It is possible to use a ring\nof operators to model key features of physical systems in a purely\nabstract, algebraic setting (this is discussed in section 4.1). A\nrelated issue concerns whether it is necessary to choose a\nrepresentation of the ring in a Hilbert space; see Haag and Kastler\n(1964), Ruetsche (2003), and Kronz and Lupher (2005) for further\ndiscussion of this issue. In any case, the separable Hilbert space\nremains a crucial framework for quantum theory. The simplest examples\nof separable Hilbert spaces are the finite dimensional ones, in which\ncase the algebra of operators is a type-I\\(_n\\) factor (n is a\npositive integer). The operators are n-by-n complex matrices, which\nare typically used to describe internal degrees of freedom such as\nspin. Readers wanting to familiarize themselves with these basic\nexamples should consult the entry on\n quantum mechanics.\n",
