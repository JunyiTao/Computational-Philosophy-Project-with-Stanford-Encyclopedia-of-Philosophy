    "main_text": "Importance and Influence || Philolaus and Pythagoras: How original is Philolaus?\n7.1 Philolaus and Pythagoras: How original is Philolaus?\n\nPythagoras is one of the most famous names in the ancient\nphilosophical tradition, and there is a natural tendency to assume\nthat he was responsible for the most fruitful ideas in the Pythagorean\ntradition. One of the dominant trends in recent scholarship on\nPythagoras, however, is to recognize that his fame grew exponentially\nwith the passage of time and that the early evidence, down to the time\nof Plato and Aristotle, when examined carefully, reveals that\nPythagoras was indeed famous but not as a typical Presocratic\ncosmologist nor as a mathematician/ scientist. In the early tradition Pythagoras is consistently\npresented as a charismatic teacher famous for two things: 1) his\nexpertise on the fate of the soul in the next life as represented in\nthe doctrine of transmigration of souls 2) his founding of a way of\nlife which some people still followed a hundred years after his death.\nThis way of life involved moral and religious teachings that were\nembodied in a series of brief sayings known as acousmata,\nwhich included ritual taboos and dietary restrictions such as the\nfamous prohibition on eating beans (Burkert 1972a, 166\u201392).\nThere is no evidence that Philolaus made any significant contribution\nin these areas. Plato\u2019s suggestion in the Phaedo that\nPhilolaus had something to say about the prohibition against suicide\nis the closest we get to a pronouncement on how to live one\u2019s life. It\nseems most reasonable to assume that he followed, to a greater or\nlesser degree, the Pythagorean life handed down from the time of\nPythagoras, who died some twenty years before Philolaus was born.\nThere are a few hints that he tried to reconcile the mythic and\nreligious side of Pythagoreanism with his own naturalistic explanation\nof the world (see 4.2 and 5.1 above).\n\nOn the other hand, Aristotle always presents the philosophical system\nof limiters and unlimiteds, which placed an emphasis on the role of\nnumber in understanding the cosmos and which included the astronomical\nsystem built around the central fire, as the work of \u201cthe\nso-called Pythagoreans,\u201d whom he dates to the second half of the\nfifth century, at the same time as or a little earlier than the\natomists (e.g. Metaph. 985b23 ff.). This is the philosophical\nsystem that we find in the fragments of Philolaus, and Aristotle\u2019s\ndating fits Philolaus exactly so there can be little doubt that\nPhilolaus was the leading figure among those labeled \u201cthe\nso-called Pythagoreans\u201d by Aristotle. Although some scholars\ncontinue to argue that most of what Aristotle ascribes to \u201cthe\nso-called Pythagoreans\u201dshould be regarded as Pythagoras\u2019 own\nteaching (Riedweg 2005, 77\u201380), Aristotle\u2019s testimony doubly\ndistances Pythagoras himself from the Philolaic system. First,\nAristotle is emphatic that the system dates after the time of\nPythagoras, and second, his expression \u201cso-called\nPythagoreans\u201d is most reasonably understood to suggest that,\nalthough he knows that the name \u201cPythagorean\u201d is often\ngiven to Philolaus and his contemporaries, he can see little reason to\nconnect the philosophical system they espouse to Pythagoras himself.\nThe later tradition also emphasizes Philolaus\u2019 originality in the area\nof cosmology by asserting that he was the first Pythagorean to publish\na work on nature (D. L. 8.85). The testimony of Aristotle and the\nlater tradition is largely confirmed by the content of Philolaus\u2019\nphilosophy. Although the contrast between limit and unlimited is\nimplicit from the beginning of the Presocratic tradition, the first\nexplicit champion of limit is Parmenides, and the attempt to explain\nthe world in terms of a combination of limiters and unlimiteds thus\nmakes most sense as arising after Parmenides has championed limit\n(Huffman 1999). Moreover, the style of argumentation in Fragments\n1\u20136, and particularly Fr. 2, is reminiscent of Parmenides and\nhis successor Melissus (Kahn 2001, 34), so that the central\nmetaphysical system and the arguments for it look very much as if they\nare the original contribution of Philolaus. The same is true of the\nastronomical system built around the central fire, which the later\ntradition assigns to Philolaus and which Aristotle (Metaph.\n986a8 ff.) and Fr. 7 explicitly tie to the philosophy of limiters and\nunlimiteds. Kahn is inclined to regard parts of the cosmogony as going\nback to Pythagoras. He argues that the idea of the cosmos breathing is\narchaic and that it may have been attacked long before Philolaus by\nXenophanes, who pointedly describes his god as not breathing; Kahn\nalso argues that the equivalence between air and void suggests a date\nbefore Anaxagoras (2001, 36\u20137). In section 4.1 above, however,\nreasons have been given to show that the Philolaic system, in fact,\ndistinguishes between air and void and hence once again conforms very\nwell to Philolaus\u2019 date after Anaxagoras. The breathing of the cosmos\nneed not be seen as archaic, since biological analogies are still\nfound in the cosmogony of the atomists (DK 67 A1). Xenophanes\u2019 remark\nis reported in only one testimonium (DK 21 A1) and is not found in any\nof the extant fragments of his book; if it is his, it need not be\ndirected at anything other than general Greek anthropomorphism.\n\nThe question remains whether or not Pythagoras had adumbrated any sort\nof cosmology and what the relation of that cosmology was to Philolaus\u2019\nlater system. It is certainly true that the discovery that the primary\nmusical concords of the octave, fourth and fifth are governed by the\nsimple whole number ratios 2 : 1, 4 : 3 and 3 : 2 occurred before\nPhilolaus. Most of the traditions connecting this discovery to\nPythagoras himself, however, are unreliable; Hippasus is the earliest\nPythagorean connected to a scientific demonstration of these\nphenomena, but the actual discovery probably antedates him and may not\nbe specifically Pythagorean (Huffman 1993, 147\u20138). It is also\ntrue that number plays a significant symbolic role in the\nacousmata that go back to the time of Pythagoras. Thus one of\nthe acousmata asserts that number is the wisest thing\n(Iamblichus, On the Pythagorean Life 82). Pythagoreans took\noaths in the name of Pythagoras as \u201cthe one who gave the\ntetraktys\u201d\u2014tetraktys being a name for\nthe first four numbers, whose total is ten, which was the perfect\nnumber for the Pythagoreans. Our evidence for the oath is late, but\nthe acousmata refer to the tetraktys as \u201cthe\nharmony in which the Sirens sang\u201d (Iamblichus, On the\nPythagorean Life 82), which may indicate an awareness of the role\nof the first four numbers in the whole-number ratios which determine\nthe musical concords. The harmony in which the Sirens sing could be a\nreference to the famous doctrine of the harmony of the spheres,\naccording to which the heavens make music by their motions. The\nacousmata also adumbrate a cosmology which is tied to a\nreligious doctrine of reward and punishment. The planets are described\nas the avenging hounds of the goddess Persephone (Porphyry, Life\nof Pythagoras 41), the sun and the moon are the isles of the\nblessed, where the good may be sent as a reward (Iamblichus, On\nthe Pythagorean Life 82), and thunder is a warning to souls in\nTartarus (Aristotle, Posterior Analytics II, 11 94b33). It\nappears then that Pythagoras had presented a vision of the cosmos\nwhich was ordered according to symbolic numbers and which reinforced\ncertain religious ideas (West 1971, 213\u201318).\nPhilolaus continues in this tradition by arguing that there are ten\ncelestial bodies arranged around the central fire, because ten is the\nperfect number, and also by perhaps endowing some of the parts of his\ncosmos with mythological and religious significance, e.g., by equating\nthe central fire with the fire guarded by Zeus and stolen by\nPrometheus (see 4.2 above). On the other hand Philolaus\u2019 attempt to\nsave astronomical phenomena by including the five planets in correct\norder according to their periods, by giving an explanation of night\nand day and by responding to concerns about how parallax might affect\nthe way the heavenly bodies appear to move has no apparent precedent\nin the cosmology of the acousmata. It would thus appear that\nPythagoras promulgated a cosmology that was largely of mythic and\nreligious significance and that Philolaus, while maintaining some of\nthis religious import, significantly reworked these ideas in order to\nproduce a system that could account for basic astronomical phenomena\n(Huffman 2013). Graham has thus recently argued that Philolaus is not\nthe mere transmitter of the earlier philosophy of Pythagoras but\nrather was the inventor of \u201cPythagorean\u201d philosophy, the\nfigure who brought Pythagoreanism out of the shadowy world of\nPythagorean lore into the light of Greek philosophical conversation\n(Graham 2014: 48).\n",
