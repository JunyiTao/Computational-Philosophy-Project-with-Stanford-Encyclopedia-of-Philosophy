    "main_text": "The Morality and Rationality of Suicide || Autonomy, Rationality, and Responsibility\n3.7 Autonomy, Rationality, and Responsibility\n\nA more restricted version of the claim that we have a right to\nnoninterference regarding suicide holds that suicide is permitted so\nlong as\u2014leaving aside questions of duties to others\u2014it is\nrationally chosen. In a similar vein, Kantians might claim that\nsuicidal choices must be respected if those choices are\nautonomous, that is, if an individual chooses to end her life\non the basis of reasons that she acknowledges as relevant to her\nsituation. Such positions are narrower than the libertarian view, in\nthat they permit suicide only when it is performed on a rational basis\n(or a rational basis that the individual acknowledges as relevant to\nher situation) and permits others to interfere only when it is not\nperformed on that basis.\n\nOne initial challenge to the possibility of rational suicide rests on\nthe notion that suicide, being a choice to end one\u2019s life, is\nnecessarily irrational. The thought here is that any coherent\njudgment of suicide\u2019s rationality requires comparing the state\nof being alive (or continuing to live) with being dead. But either\nbecause no one has sufficient knowledge of the state of being dead\n(Devine 1978) or because suicide ensures that the suicidal person has\nno future to look forward to (Cowley 2006), judgments that ending\none\u2019s life is rational are incoherent or misplaced.\n\nIn recent years, this \u2018two-state\u2019 requirement (that death\ncan only be judged rational or irrational if it is possible to compare\nthe state of being alive with the state of being dead) has been widely\nrejected. In particular, the rationality of the decision to end\none\u2019s life need not be construed in terms of the value of being\nalive versus the value of being dead (Luper 2009, 82\u201388).\nRather, the rationality of suicide concerns a choice about the value\nor quality of different lives one could have: a shorter life, whose\nduration is truncated by suicide, versus the longer life an individual\nwould be most likely to have if they forego suicide. As Richard Brandt\nhas put it, what those contemplating ending their lives are\nconsidering are different durations or courses of their lives:\n\nThe person who is contemplating suicide is obviously making a choice\nbetween future world-courses: the world-course that includes his\ndemise, say, an hour from now, and several possible ones that contain\nhis demise at a later point\u2026 The basic question a person must\nanswer in order to determine which world-course is best or rational\nfor him to choose, is which he would choose under conditions\nof optimal use of information, when all of his desires are\ntaken into account. (Brandt 1975)\n\n\nHence, on this view, a rational judgment about one\u2019s own death\nrequires a comparison between the overall goodness of one\u2019s life\nas it would be if it continued on its present course and the overall\ngoodness of one\u2019s life if that life ended before its present\ncourse.\n\nThat suicide\u2019s rationality depends on comparing a life shortened\nby suicide to a longer life has given rise to a rich philosophical\nliterature trying to identify the specific conditions under which a\nperson\u2019s decision to die is rational. For the most part, this\nliterature divides the conditions for rational suicide into\ncognitive conditions, conditions ensuring that\nindividuals\u2019 appraisals of their situation are rational and\nwell-informed, and interest conditions, conditions ensuring\nthat suicide in fact accords with individuals\u2019 considered\ninterests.\n\nExamples of this approach include Glenn Graber, who states that a\nsuicide is rationally justified \u201cif a reasonable appraisal of\nthe situation reveals that one is better off dead.\u201d (Graber\n1981, 65). An appraisal is reasonable, according to Graber, if it\nresults from a clearheaded assessment of how suicide would further or\nimpede one\u2019s overall interests, including one\u2019s present\nand probable future values and preferences. Margaret Battin identifies\nthree cognitive conditions for rational suicide (a facility for causal\nand inferential reasoning, possession of a realistic world view, and\nadequacy of information relevant to one\u2019s decision), along with\ntwo interest conditions (that dying enables one to avoid future harms,\nand that dying accords with one\u2019s most fundamental interests and\ncommitments) (Pabst Battin 1996, 115).\n\nFor the most part, suicidal individuals do not manifest signs of\nsystemic irrationality, much less the signs of legally\ndefinable insanity, (Radden 1982) and engage in suicidal conduct\nvoluntarily. However, these facts are consistent with the choice to\nengage in suicidal behavior being irrational, and serious questions\ncan be raised about just how often the conditions for rational suicide\nare met in actual cases of self-inflicted death. Indeed, the\npossibility of rational suicide requires that certain assumptions\nabout suicidal individuals\u2019 rational autonomy be true which may\nnot be in many cases. A person\u2019s choice to undertake suicidal\nbehavior may not be a reflection of her considered interests, and so\nher self-inflicted death would be an act that she would, in calmer and\nclearer moments, recoil at. For instance, only some suicidal persons\nengage in extensive planning for their own deaths. In many instances,\nthe final determination to end one\u2019s life is instead impulsive,\nreflecting suicidal persons\u2019 proclivity toward volatility and\nagitation (Cholbi 2002, Joiner 2010, 70\u201384). And although\nrepeated suicide attempts by the same individual are common, the\nimpulse to suicidal behavior is often transient and dissipates of its\nown accord (Blauner 2003). Suicidal persons can also have difficulty\nappreciating the finality of their deaths, believing that (assuming\nthere is no afterlife) they will somehow continue to be subjects of\nconscious experience after they die. They may occasionally exhibit\nromanticized and grandiose beliefs about the likely effects of their\ndeaths (delusions of martyrdom, revenge, etc.) Furthermore, suicidal\npersons are often hesitant about their own actions, hoping that others\nwill intervene and signaling to others the hope that they will\nintervene (Shneidman 1985). Considerations such as these seem to imply\nthat the choice to engage in suicide is often not rational in that it\ndoes not reflect sound reasoning, an adequate grasp of one\u2019s\nsituation, or a clearheaded understanding of the implications of\none\u2019s suicide in relation to one\u2019s long-term\ninterests.\n\nA further complication about the rationality of suicide is the evident\nlink between suicidal thoughts and mental illnesses such as\ndepression. Some studies of suicide indicate that over 90% of suicidal\npersons displayed symptoms of depression before death, while others\nestimate that suicide is at least 20 times more common among those\nwith clinical depression than in the general population. In cases of\nsuicide linked with depression, individuals\u2019 attitudes toward\ntheir own death are colored by strongly negative and occasionally\ndistorted beliefs about their life situations (career prospects,\nrelationships, etc.). As Brandt (1975) observed, depression can\n\u201cprimitivize one\u2019s intellectual processes,\u201d leading\nto poor estimation of probabilities and an irrational focus on present\nsuffering rather than on possible future goods. Such findings provide\nevidence that suicidal behavior is typically, though not necessarily,\nirrational.\n\nAll the same, caution is in order both about the relationship between\nsuicidal thought and mental illness and about the relation between\nmental illness and suicidal choices being rational or autonomous. The\nmere fact of having a mental illness does not entail that one is\nirrational or incompetent to make one\u2019s own choices. (See\n decision making capacity.)\u00a0All\n the more, disagreement continues about the strength of the link\nbetween suicide and mental illness, (Pabst Battin 1996, 5) and while\nmany of those who engage in suicidal behavior seem to be mentally ill,\nthe relationship is rather weak in the other direction: Most of those\nwith diagnosed mental illness such as depression do not\nengage in suicidal behavior, implying that other factors besides\nmental illness may be equally important in predicting suicide. (Joiner\n2010) In addition, doubts can be raised about how the link is\nunderstood. Some have argued that the mental health professions have\ncome to see some mental illness as defined by suicidal behavior, i.e.,\nthat it is a sign or symptom of a disorder such as depression or\nschizophrenia that the individual in question is suicidal. But under\nthis understanding of the relationship, that mental illness is\nresponsible for suicidal behavior does not seem to be a testable\nempirical or scientific hypothesis but a normative judgment about the\nrationality of suicide. In other words, the link between suicide and\nmental illness turns out to reflect a controversial normative judgment\nthat those contemplating ending their lives have\n\u2018disordered\u2019 minds.
