    "main_text": "Correspondence with Dilthey\n2. Correspondence with Dilthey\n\nWhen in 1923 the Correspondence between Yorck and Dilthey\n(Yorck 1923) (abbreviated hereafter as CR) was published as \u201ca\nmemorial\u201d to their philosophical friendship (CR, VI), it\nestablished Yorck not only as an equal to Dilthey and a faithful\ninterlocutor and eager co-worker on Dilthey\u2019s\n project(s),[2]\n but also as a philosopher and keen observer of his times in his own\nright.\n\nIn 1892 Yorck writes to Dilthey:\n\n\nOur time portends something of an end of an epoch. A token of this is\nthe disappearance of the elemental pleasure in historical realities.\nThe feeling that everything passes [Gef\u00fchl der\nVerg\u00e4nglichkeit] haunts the world once again. (CR, p.\n140)\n\n\nDilthey clearly shares this sentiment. In a more extensive note about\nthe same topic Yorck writes:\n\n\nIt is my growing conviction that today we stand at a historical\nturning point similar to the one of the 15th century. In\ncontradistinction to the scientific-technological progress, which\nconsists in increased abstraction and isolation, a new formation comes\ninto being because the human being in his entirety [der ganze\nMensch] once again takes a stand and faces the problems of life.\nEvery time it is a new stance towards life [Lebensstellung]\nand a new conception of it that ushers in a new epoch, not any old\ndiscovery or invention, even if it is of the greatest import. The\nthread on which science hangs has become so long and spun ever so\nthin, that now it is snapping in the face of the impetuous question:\nWhat is truth? (CR, p. 128)\n\n\nIn yet another letter, Yorck claims that, since the Renaissance,\nscience and knowledge\u2014abstracted from feeling and\nvolition\u2014have followed an eccentric trajectory, in which they\nhave lost sight of man, resulting in profound self-alienation:\n\n\nThe ripple effects caused by the eccentric principle, which ushered in\na new age more than four hundred years ago, seem to me to have become\nexceedingly broad and flat; knowledge has advanced to the point of\nnullifying itself, and man has become so far removed from himself that\nhe no longer catches sight of himself. \u2018Modern\u2019 man, that\nis, man since the Renaissance, is fit for the grave. (CR, p. 83)\n\n\nThe general thrust of these reflections and the language used are\nreminiscent of Nietzsche\u2019s descriptions of the \u201cuncanniest\nof all guests,\u201d nihilism. In fact, it is the usually so cautious\nDilthey who, in one of his last letters to Yorck, remarks that the\ntrue but \u201chorrible word about the age has been announced\u201d\nby no one other than Nietzsche (CR, p. 238). There is no reason to\nbelieve that Yorck would have disagreed.\n\nYorck\u2019s and Dilthey\u2019s awareness of an epochal shift,\nwritten some twenty years before World War I, could not fail to\nimpress the generation of students who, in the aftermath of this\nEuropean catastrophe, their predicament exacerbated by continued\neconomic hardship and hyperinflation, returned to studying philosophy\nin the early 1920s. This may explain why, much later, in the 1980s,\nGadamer would still speak of the enormous significance of the\npublication of the Dilthey\u2013Yorck correspondence in 1923, calling\nit an \u201cepoch-making moment\u201d in its own right (Gadamer\n1995, p. 8).\n\nAccording to Yorck, the analysis and evaluation of the contemporary\nintellectual-historical situation is integral to philosophy\u2014all\nthe more so if philosophy self-reflexively grasps its ineluctably\nhistorical nature, which in itself is one of Yorck\u2019s main\nphilosophical interests. The basic idea for the historicity of\nphilosophy is fairly straightforward. For Yorck, as for Dilthey,\nphilosophy is \u201ca manifestation of life\u201d\n[Lebensmanifestation] (CR, p. 250), a product or an\nexpression in which life articulates itself in a certain way. But all\nlife is intrinsically historical. Life is inconceivable without its\nhistorical development. Yorck writes:\n\n\nThe entire given psycho-physical reality is not something that\nis, but something that lives: that is the germ cell of\nhistoricity. And self-reflection, which is directed not at an abstract\nI, but the entirety of my own self, will find that I am historically\ndetermined, just as physics grasps me as determined by the cosmos.\nJust as I am nature, I am history. And in this decisive sense we have\nto understand Goethe\u2019s dictum of [our] having lived\n[Gelebthaben] for at least three thousand years. Conversely,\nit follows that history as a scientific discipline exists only as\npsychology of history. (CR 71/72)\n\n\nFor Yorck, as for Dilthey, human life is incorrectly understood if it\nis subsumed under the generic catch-all category of\n\u201cexistence.\u201d The first point is that human life is\ninconceivable without temporal and historical development, movement,\nand change; life always transcends itself, hence it never simply\n\u201cis.\u201d The mode of being for humans is \u201clife,\u201d\nnot\n \u201cexistence.\u201d[3]\n And life, unlike existence, is intrinsically historical. Precisely\nthis distinction is brought home by Yorck\u2019s demand to always\nobserve \u201cthe generic difference between the ontic and the\nhistorical\u201d (CR, p. 191). The ontic is what is simply\n\u201cthere\u201d without inner life, temporality, or history. It\nincludes the physical entities in the world, as well as abstract\nobjects, numbers, essences, ideas, etc. The \u201contic\u201d is\ntoto caelo other than \u201cthe historical.\u201d\nYorck\u2019s second point is that all history is a development of\nhuman powers or human psychology, where psychology does not\nmean some inert or fixed \u201cnature,\u201d but the constant play\nof forces, the ever shifting configurations between understanding,\naffectivity, and volition. (See\n Section 3.1\n below.)\n\nIn addition, Yorck emphasizes the \u201cvirtuality\u201d or\n\u201ceffectivity\u201d of history, i.e., the cumulative effects and\nresults of individual persons exerting power and influence in\ntransmitting the possibility and conception of life to their\ndescendants. Successor-generations develop their own stance towards\nlife in response to what they have inherited from the individuals and\ngenerations preceding them. History is the ongoing transmission of\nlife\u2019s potentiality, including the transmission of power, ideas,\nand material conditions.\n\n\nThe child gains through the mother\u2019s sacrifice, her sacrifice\nbenefits the child. Without such virtual transmission of power\n[Kraft\u00fcbertragung] there is no history at all. (CR, p.\n155)\n\n\nYorck does not refer to some anonymous bio-power or power structures,\nas discussed in contemporary philosophy, but to the authority,\nsacrifice, and direct action and communication through which an\nindividual person or groups of persons form and shape the lives and\nbehaviours of coming generations. It is for this reason that Yorck\ninsists that \u201cperson\u201d is the key historical category (CR,\np. 109). History is the history of historical, individual agents,\nprojecting their power and authority into the future.\n\nSince Yorck understands history as a connecting band of ideas and\nconditions passed on from one person to another, and indeed from one\ngeneration to another, his position must not be associated with\nhistoricism. For Yorck, there is one continuous and common line of\nhistorical life\u2014a living syndesmos. Past generations\nand past persons are not \u201coutside\u201d a present horizon in a\npast world of their own. Rather, they live on, as it were, in their\ndescendents. Moreover, because of this connecting band, one can go\n\u201cbackwards\u201d by way of what Yorck calls\n\u201ctransposition\u201d (CR, p. 61), transposing oneself into the\nlives of others and thus \u201cre-enacting,\u201d as Dilthey would\nsay, the positions towards life that have been lived by one\u2019s\npredecessors. That life is historical means that each person is always\nalready outside his or her own individual \u201cnature\u201d and\nplaced within the historical connection to predecessor- and\nsuccessor-generations. For Yorck, living self-consciousness is, to use\nHegel\u2019s fortuitous phrase, \u201cthe I that is\nwe and the we that is I\u201d (Hegel 1807,\np. 140).\n\nConsequently, Yorck rejects from the start the transcendental method\nin philosophy as insufficient for grasping lived historical reality.\nTranscendental philosophy reduces historical life to the merely\n\u201csubjective,\u201d which misses the genuine characteristic of\nGeist, spirit or mind, namely its real, historical extension\nand connection. As Yorck puts it, \u201cthe transcendental\nmethod\u201d merely suspends or sublates \u201cthe realm of the\nobjective,\u201d but it fails to \u201cextend the region of\nGeist\u201d (CR, p. 194). Insisting that \u201cthe\ncharacter of subjectivity does not even reach the realm of\nGeist\u201d (CR, p. 194), Yorck clearly implies that the\n\u201crealm of history\u201d is the proper domain for\nGeist. It follows that, despite his criticism of the narrow\nconfines of transcendental and/or subject-centred philosophy,\nYorck\u2019s philosophical conception of history is still inscribed\nwithin the confines of Geist-philosophy. Following Hegel, who\nargues that everything hinges on the understanding that\n\u201csubstance is subject\u201d (Hegel 1807, p. 19), Yorck agrees\nthat everything hinges on the understanding that \u201csubstance is\nhistory\u201d or \u201csubstance is historical\n spirit.\u201d[4]\n\nYorck\u2019s primary category of historical life does not only\nchallenge transcendental philosophy as too-narrow a foothold for\nphilosophy. A fortiori, it also challenges the entire\nmetaphysical tradition, which presupposes or searches for an ultimate\nobjective reality (being, idea, substance, and so on), divorced from\nthe ground of the always shifting historical life. Yorck rejects\nclaims to \u201cknowledge\u201d sub specie aeternitatis.\nFor Yorck, metaphysics is a flight from the historical reality\n\u2018on the ground.\u2019 By making historical life primary, Yorck\neffectively aims to dismantle the predominance of Greek metaphysics,\nincluding the modes of thought of modern science derived from it.\n\nBut Yorck is not content with just opposing metaphysics and\ntranscendental philosophy. Instead, he attempts to instill and to\ncultivate historical awareness in philosophy itself, based on the\nprinciple that all productions of life are as historical as life\nitself. He writes: Since \u201cto philosophize is to live,\u201d\n\u201cthere is no real philosophizing which would not be\nhistorical\u201d (CR, p. 251). More radical than Dilthey, Yorck calls\nfor the \u201chistoricization\u201d [Vergeschichtlichung]\nof philosophy:\n\n\nJust as physiology cannot abstract from physics, so\nphilosophy\u2014especially if it is critical\u2014cannot abstract\nfrom historicity [Geschichtlichkeit]. After all, the\nuncritical Critique of Kant\u2019s can be understood\nhistorically only, and thus be overcome. [Human] behaviour and\nhistoricity are like breathing and air pressure\u2014and\u2014this\nmay sound somewhat paradoxical\u2014the failure to historicize\nphilosophizing appears to me, in methodological respects, a\nmetaphysical remnant. (CR, 69)\n\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that, unlike Dilthey, Yorck\nspecifically appreciates the emphasis on historicity\n [Geschichtlichkeit][5]\n in Hegel and some of his followers, despite his rejection of\nHegel\u2019s speculative or ontical superstructure (CR,\n 59).[6]\n\nIn light of the historical nature of philosophy, Yorck draws two\ndecisive methodological inferences. First, he rejects as too rigid and\nuntenable the opposition between theoretical or systematic philosophy\nand the history of ideas (CR, p. 251), because, as an ongoing\nhistorical development, philosophy always requires both a genetic and\nhistorical clarification, as well as a systematic and theoretical\naccount. Instead of a mutually exclusive relation, Yorck sees a\nmutually productive combination. Second, because Yorck always includes\nthe present situation within the domain of history, he calls for a\n\u201ccritical,\u201d and not \u201cantiquarian,\u201d or\nquietistic mode of philosophizing (CR, p. 19). Speaking for Dilthey\nand himself, Yorck argues that this critical work of philosophy lays\nthe groundwork for the practical intent or the historical vocation of\nphilosophy:\n\n\nThe potential for practical application is of course the real\njustification for any science. Yet mathematical praxis is not\nthe only kind. In practical terms, our standpoint is pedagogical in\nintent, in the broadest and deepest sense of the word. It is the soul\nof all true philosophy and the truth of Plato and Aristotle. (CR, pp.\n42/ 43)\n\n\nIn the condensed and all too general format of the\nCorrespondence with Dilthey, Yorck develops the practical\n\u201capplication\u201d of philosophy in only the most fragmentary\nfashion. Its most important part is the actual clarification of the\ncontemporary situation, the determination of the given historical\npossibilities, and the avenues for implementing some of them. Yorck\nholds that since the Renaissance and through the works of such\nthinkers as Galileo, Descartes, and Hobbes, the self-interpretation of\nlife has found its centre of gravity in the cultivation of the\ntheoretical understanding [Verstand]. The primacy accorded to\ntheoretical understanding and what it projects as objective,\nunchangeable, and ultimate reality (metaphysical & physical) has\nushered in \u201cthe natural sciences,\u201d\n\u201cnominalism,\u201d \u201crationalism,\u201d and\n\u201cmechanism,\u201d (CR, pp. 68, 63 & 155). But this has come\nat the exclusion of the full thematization, expression, and\nappreciation of human affectivity [Gef\u00fchl], including\nthe underlying feeling of human connectivity through a shared life in\nhistory. Blocked-out are questions which affect the temporal,\nhistorical and personal existence of human beings, or what Yorck once\ncalls \u201cexistential questions\u201d [Existenzialfragen]\n(CR, p. 62), which relate to the life-goals human beings strive after,\nthe recognition of dependency, and the awareness of human mortality,\nfinitude, and death (CR, p. 120). The relative sidelining of these\naspects in the psychology of human beings lies at the bottom of\nYorck\u2019s diagnosis of the increasing self-alienation of modern\nman and the crisis of his time.\n\nWith Dilthey, Yorck attempts to highlight the \u201cfull human\nbeing\u201d [den ganzen Menschen] (CR, p. 157), as opposed\nto the rationalistically reduced, one-dimensional individual that has\npreoccupied modern philosophy and shaped modern culture. The\nhistoricization of philosophy belongs to this project, as does the\nacknowledgment of transcendence. According to Yorck, transcendence\n(CR, pp. 120, 144) facilitates the withdrawal from the world in its\nobjective reality (as represented by thought and metaphysics). It lets\nhuman life pivot around the personal, historical, and affective\ndimension, foregrounding personal responsibility and accountability to\nthe transcendent God. Against the theoretical-metaphysical stance\ndirected at an ever present objective reality, Yorck insists on the\nprimacy of the personal, historical relation to the transcendent God.\nYorck\u2019s dictum \u201cTranscendence contra metaphysics!\u201d\nexpresses not only a very strong leitmotif in his philosophical\nthought (CR, p. 42); it is actually the very\n capstone.[7]\n For this reason, Yorck has been interpreted as a religious\nexistentialist (Kaufmann, 1928). This sets him apart from Dilthey.\nYorck\u2019s conception of Christianity is heavily biased in favour\nof Luther\u2019s theology. According to Yorck, Luther\u2019s\nanti-metaphysical, historical stance towards transcendence remains a\nhistorical task for the future development of philosophy (CR, pp. 144\n& 145).\n\nSince Yorck frequently and conspicuously uses the term\nBodenlosigkeit [groundlessness], or bodenloses\nDenken [groundless thought] to describe the one-sided\nintellectualism of the scientific-technological civilization since the\nRenaissance (CR, pp. 39, 103, 250, 230, 143), questions have been\nraised about Yorck\u2019s preference for autochthony\n[Bodenst\u00e4ndigkeit] and the political implications\n thereof.[8]\n",
