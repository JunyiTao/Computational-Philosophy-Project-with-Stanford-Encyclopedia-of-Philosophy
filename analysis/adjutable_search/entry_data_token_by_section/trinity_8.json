    "main_text": "One-self Theories || The Holy Spirit as a Mode of God\n1.8 The Holy Spirit as a Mode of God\n\nSome ancient Christians, most 17th-19th century unitarians,\npresent-day \u201cbiblical unitarians\u201d, and some modern\nsubordinationists such as the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses hold the Holy\nSpirit to be a mode of God\u2014God\u2019s power, presence, or\naction in the world. (See the supplementary document on\n unitarianism.)\n Not implying modalism about the Son, this position is harder to\nrefute on New Testament grounds, although mainstream theologians and\nsome subordinationist unitarians reject it as inconsistent with New\nTestament language from which we should infer that the Holy Spirit is\na self (Clarke 1738, 147). Modalists about the Spirit counter with\nother biblical language which suggests that the \u201cSpirit of\nGod\u201d or \u201cHoly Spirit\u201d refers to either God himself,\na mode of God (e.g., his power), or an effect of a mode of God (e.g.,\nsupernatural human abilities such as healing). (See Burnap 1845,\n226\u201352; Lardner 1793, 79\u2013174; Wilson 1846, 325\u201332.)\nThis exegetical dispute is difficult, as all natural languages allow\npersons to be described in mode-terms (\u201cHillary is Bill\u2019s\nstrength.\u201d) and modes to be described in language which\nliterally applies only to persons. (\u201cGod\u2019s wisdom told him\nnot to create beer-sap trees.\u201d)\n",
