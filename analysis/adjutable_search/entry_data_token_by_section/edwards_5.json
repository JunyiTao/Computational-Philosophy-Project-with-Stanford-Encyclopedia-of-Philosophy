    "main_text": "Value Theory || Ethics\n3.1 Ethics\n\nTrue virtue aims at the good of being in general and therefore also\nprizes the disposition that promotes it. Truly virtuous people thus\nlove two things \u2014 being and benevolence. They not only value\nbenevolence because it promotes the general good, however; they also\n\u201crelish\u201d or delight in it for its own sake. Hence, while\nvirtue \u201cmost essentially consists in benevolence to being\u201d\n(True Virtue, 1765; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 8, 540), in a\nwider sense it includes not only benevolence but also\n\u201ccomplacence\u201d in benevolence's intrinsic excellence or\nbeauty.\n\nGod, though, \u201cis infinitely the greatest being,\u201d and\n\u201cinfinitely the most beautiful and excellent.\u201d True virtue\nthus principally consists \u201cin a supreme love to God, both of\nbenevolence and complacence\u201d (True Virtue, 1765;\nEdwards 1957\u2013, vol. 8, 550\u201351). It follows that \u201ca\ndetermination of mind to union and benevolence to a particular\nperson or private system [whether one's self, one's\nfamily, one's nation, or even humanity], which is but a small part of\nthe universal system of being\u2026is not of the nature of true\nvirtue\u201d unless it is dependent on or \u201csubordinate to,\nbenevolence to Being in general\u201d (True\nVirtue, 1765; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 8, 554).\n\nOne of the principal concerns of Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, et al., was\nto refute the contention that action is always motivated by self-love.\nEdwards' attitude toward these attempts is ambivalent. On the one\nhand, he denies that the truly benevolent are motivated by\nself-love. On the other, Edwards argues (against, e.g., Hutcheson)\nthat most conscientious and other regarding behavior is, indeed, a\nform of self-love and that, in any case, acts motivated by rational\nself-love, conscience, or natural other regarding instincts such as\nparental affection or pity aren't genuinely virtuous.\n\nConscience, for instance, is the product of a power of placing\nourselves in the situation of others (which is needed for any sort of\nmutual understanding), a sense of the natural fitness of certain\nresponses (injury and punishment or disapproval, benefit and reward or\napproval), and self-love. Placing ourselves in the situation of those\nwe have injured, we recognize that being treated in that way would not\nmerely anger us but seem unfitting or undeserved, and that we are\ntherefore inconsistent in approving of our treating others in ways we\nwould not wish to be treated ourselves. The result is a sense of\n\u201cinconsistence\u201d or \u201cself-opposition\u201d between\nfeelings of approval and disapproval toward the same action. This\nmakes us \u201cuneasy\u201d since \u201cself-love implies an\ninclination to feel and act as one with ourselves\u201d (True\nVirtue, 1765; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 8, 589).\n\nWhat, though, about instinctual other regarding impulses such as\nparental affection, \u201cmutual affection between the sexes\u201d\n(as distinct from simple sexual attraction), and pity? Edwards is\ninclined to think that all except pity are forms of self-love. The\nimportant point, however, is that even if they aren't, actions\nmotivated by them aren't truly virtuous. To see why consider pity. If\ntruly virtuous actions are motivated by benevolence to being\nin general, then actions motivated by other regarding impulses which\nare ultimately directed to \u201csome particular persons or private\nsystem\u201d aren't truly virtuous (True Virtue, 1765;\nEdwards 1957\u2013, vol. 8, 601). Now pity is directed to those in\nextreme distress whose suffering appears undeserved or excessive. Its\nobject is therefore restricted to only part of being in general.\nFurthermore, since instinctual affections aren't\n\u201cdependent\u201d on \u201cgeneral benevolence,\u201d they are\nin potential conflict with it. Pity, for example, may motivate a judge\nto act unjustly.\n\nWe should not conclude that pity or other instinctual affections, or\neven rational self-love, are bad. Since they tend toward \u201cthe\npreservation of mankind and their comfortably subsisting in the\nworld,\u201d things would be much worse without them (True\nVirtue, 1765; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 8, 600). Edwards point\n(like Kant's) is merely that their goodness isn't a truly moral\ngoodness. The implication is nonetheless clear. Natural virtues are\neither tainted with self-love or fail to extend to being in general.\nThey are therefore counterfeits or simulacra of true virtue. While\nthey prompt us to promote the good of others, and to condemn vice,\nthey fall infinitely \u201cshort of the extent of true virtuous\nbenevolence, both in\u2026nature and object\u201d (True\nVirtue, 1765; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 8, 609). Edwards\nconcludes that true virtue is a supernatural gift.\n",
