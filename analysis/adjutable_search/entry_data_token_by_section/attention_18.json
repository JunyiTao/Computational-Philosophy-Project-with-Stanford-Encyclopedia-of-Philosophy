    "main_text": "Explanatory Roles for Attention || Attention in Ethics\n4.2 Attention in Ethics\n\nSimone Weil suggests that attention has an absolutely central role in\nethics, and in value theory more broadly, writing that:\n\nThe authentic and pure values \u2013 truth, beauty and goodness\n\u2013 in the activity of a human being are the result of one and the\nsame act, a certain application of the full attention to the object.\n(Weil, 1986, p. 214)\n\n\nThis apotheosizing of attention provides the basis for Weil\u2019s\nclaims about priorities for education. On these points, her position\nis shared by a number of other figures whose work sits at the\ninterface of philosophy and literature (see Mole, 2017). Christopher\nThomas has suggested that the role played by attention in Weil\u2019s\n\u2018ethics of affliction\u2019 can be interpreted as an attempt to\nput some central notions from Kant\u2019s aesthetic theory to ethical\nwork (Thomas, 2020).\n\nThe influence of Kant was in the foreground, together with the\ninteractions between ethics and aesthetics, when Weil\u2019s claims\nabout attention\u2019s import were developed in the work of Iris\nMurdoch. Murdoch suggests that there are certain forms of attention\nthat play an essential role in the exercise of the virtues (Murdoch,\n1970, see Bagnoli, 2003, Mole, 2006). She implies that a capacity for\nthese forms of attention can be cultivated through experiences of\nbeauty. These themes have been taken up by Dorothea Debus, who places\nparticular emphasis on Weil\u2019s claim that it is full\nattention to which cardinal value is attributed (Debus, 2015). Antony\nFredriksson and Silvia Panizza suggest that the aspects of attention\nthat Murdoch takes to be important are seen with particular clarity if\none adopts the perspective of Maurice Merleau-Ponty\u2019s account of\nattention, in which the openness of the attentive mind is\nemphasized (Fredriksson & Panizza, 2020). Nicolas Bommarito has\ndeveloped an account of modesty along broadly Murdochian lines, as\nbeing a \u2018virtue of attention\u2019. He argues that this avoids\nepistemic difficulties that other accounts of modesty face, if they\ninstead characterize modesty as requiring false beliefs about the\nextent of one\u2019s strengths (Bommarito, 2013).\n\nSimilar issues are approached from a somewhat different direction by\nPeter Goldie (Goldie, 2004), and Michael Brady (Brady, 2010), both of\nwho relate attention and virtue to the epistemic significance of a\nperson\u2019s emotional life. Both Goldie and Brady suggest that the\nattention-modulating profile of an emotion is essential to it, and\nboth claim that this modulation of attention by emotion plays an\nineliminable role in our having a full appreciation of the evaluative\nproperties that we encounter in the world around us. Goldie and Brady\ndisagree as to how this epistemic role should be characterized, with\nGoldie taking the experience of one\u2019s own emotion to itself be a\nreason-giving experience, with an epistemic authority analogous to\none\u2019s experiences of the things in one\u2019s visual field,\nwhereas Brady takes the emotional subject\u2019s experience of items\nin the world to have an epistemic authority that is not shared by the\nsubject\u2019s experience of their own emotional state, so that that\nstate\u2019s epistemic significance must instead be exhausted by its\ninfluence on our outwardly-directed attention (Brady, 2013).\n4.3 Attention in Social and Political Theory\n\nMany theorists and commentators have noted that some of the largest\nbusinesses are, like Google and Facebook, ones that receive very\nlittle money from the end-users of their best known products, but that\ndo receive an enormous amount of attention from those users. Writers\nwho have noted this have often taken it to be symptomatic of a\ncondition that contributes centrally to the current zeitgeist\n(Williams, 2018, Odell, 2019). This contribution is typically taken to\nbe a deleterious one. Michael Goldhaber seems to have been among the\nfirst to describe this condition as a shift from an \u2018information\neconomy\u2019 to an \u2018attention economy\u2019 (Goldhaber,\n1997), following Herbert Simon\u2019s suggestion one might give an\neconomic construal of the fact that attention becomes scarce when\ninformation is abundant (Simon, 1971).\n\nThe suggestion that the present century has seen a distinctive\ncommodification of attention has become widespread. This shift has\nbeen theorized using the conceptual resources of various social and\npolitical philosophies. Jonathan Beller exemplifies a broadly Marxist\napproach, by offering an \u2018attention theory of value\u2019\n(Beller 2006). Clinton Castro and Adam Pham draw on Debra Satz\u2019s\nnotion of \u2018noxious markets\u2019 to argue that technologies\ndesigned to maximize attentive engagement should be regulated in ways\nanalogous to the regulation of the tobacco industry (Castro &\nPham, 2020, drawing on Satz, 2010). Georg Franck uses concepts drawn\nfrom the work of Levinas and Heidegger to give an account of the\nattention economy\u2019s role in mediating our transactions of mutual\nrecognition and respect (Franck, 1998).\n\nThe technologies that have driven this social change do indeed have\neffects on attention. Empirical studies that have measured these\neffects have tended to frame them with reference to their downstream\nsocial consequences, rather than their immediate cognitive basis.\nRosen, Carrier and Cheever, for example, observe the effects of social\nmedia use on the study habits of students at school and university,\nand relate these effects to educational performance, in order to\nsuggest some pedagogical strategies by which these effects might be\nameliorated (Rosen et al, 2013). Such theorists have made relatively\nlittle theoretical contact with the accounts of attention offered by\nphilosophers or cognitive psychologists, although there are some (such\nas Atchley and Lane, 2014) who refer to a bottleneck theory of\nattention, in order to explain the way in which attention-demanding\ntechnologies reduce the attention that is available for other purposes\n(see\n \u00a72.1,\n above). Rather than referring to theories of the cognitive basis of\nattention, claims about the psychological effects of the attention\neconomy have often been framed with reference to theories of the\npsychological basis of addiction (e.g., Bharvaga and Velsquez,\n2020).",
