    "main_text": "\n\nChristian Wolff (1679\u20131754) was a philosopher, mathematician,\nand scientist of the German Enlightenment. He is widely and rightly\nregarded as the most important and influential German philosopher\nbetween Leibniz and Kant. His scholarly output was prolific, numbering\nmore than 50 (most multi-volume) titles, in addition to dozens of\nshorter essays and prefaces and nearly 500 book reviews. Through his\nseries of textbooks, published first in German and then in Latin,\nWolff made signal contributions to nearly every area of philosophical\ninvestigation of his time, including but not limited to logic,\nmetaphysics, ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics. Wolff is\nperhaps best known in his role as (co-)founder of the\n\u201cLeibnizian-Wolffian philosophy\u201d, and while Wolff himself\nrejected the term, the philosophical system it designates quickly\ngained broad, if not universal, acceptance within German universities\nin the first half of the eighteenth century.\n\nWolff\u2019s influence on German philosophy is manifold and profound.\nThrough his textbooks and his \u201cmartyrdom\u201d for the cause of\nEnlightenment, he succeeded in placing modern philosophical ideas at\nthe forefront of German academic debate. Moreover, since he was among\nthe first to publish philosophical texts in German, Wolff had a\nformative role in establishing German itself as a philosophical\nlanguage. Wolff\u2019s philosophy gained an ascendant position in the\nGerman academy as a result of his own (seemingly tireless) defense of\nhis ideas as well as through his many students and sympathizers,\nincluding Georg Bernhard Bilfinger (1693\u20131750), Ludwig Philipp\nTh\u00fcmmig (1697\u20131728), F. Chr. Baumeister (1709\u201385), A.\nG. Baumgarten (1714\u201362), G. F. Meier (1718\u201377), and J. C.\nGottsched (1700\u201366). Among his more prominent adherents and\n(sometime) admirers, Wolff could count Voltaire, \u00c9milie du\nCh\u00e2telet, Moses Mendelssohn, Frederick the Great (who had a hand\nin translating one of his works), and Catherine the Great (who offered\nhim a pension). Kant, who himself owed much to Wolff for both the form\nand content of his philosophy, would later recognize him in the\nPreface to the Critique of Pure Reason as \u201cthe greatest\nof all dogmatic philosophers\u201d (B xxxvi).\n",
