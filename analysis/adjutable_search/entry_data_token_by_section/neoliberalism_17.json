    "main_text": "Criticisms of Neoliberalism || Colonialist Criticisms\n7.8 Colonialist Criticisms\n\nIt is common in some circles to argue that neoliberal regimes are\ncolonialist in character, though in an unusually direct way. The\nthought is that neoliberalism was adopted by regimes in the Anglophone\nworld and in much of Western Europe, and that this formed an\ninternational elite consensus about how economies around the world\nshould be run. This led to a \u201cWashington Consensus\u201d that\ncaused policy interventions that interfered with the democratic\ngovernance of developing nations, increased inequality, and made the\npoor worse off. For comprehensive discussion, see Whyte (2019:\nchapters 3\u20135).\n",
