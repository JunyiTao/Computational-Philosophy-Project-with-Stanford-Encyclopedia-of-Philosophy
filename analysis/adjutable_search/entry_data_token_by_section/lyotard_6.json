    "main_text": "Major Works || The Inhuman and the Event\n4. The Future of Lyotard\n\nLyotard\u2019s writings have been seen as paradigmatic of the\nexcesses of \u201chigh theory\u201d in the 1970s and 1980s. His\naccount of language games and refusal to allow any to have a grip on\nreality is supposed by his critics to have helped usher in a\n\u201cpost-fact\u201d world. Yet Lyotard\u2019s claims, as he well\nknew, were not far from the anti-realisms of those in Anglo-American\nphilosophy influenced by Ludwig Wittgenstein, such as Michael Dummett\n(1925\u20132011), who at the time Lyotard was writing argued that\nclaims to reality were merely moves within a given conceptual scheme\nand there was no test external to these schemes for corresponding that\nscheme to an external reality. Though this led Dummett to an\nanti-realist position on time, following J. M. E. McTaggart\n(1866\u20131925), Lyotard\u2019s thinking of phrase regimens and\ntheir limits were meant to testify, as The Inhuman makes\nclear, to human finitude and the unassailable coming of the future and\nthe simplicity of events. The future, as such, is not something that\ncan be predicted from the present, since this would only be a present\nimagined into the future. Lyotard, especially in The Postmodern\nCondition, assailed realisms, but always from the point of view\nthat these \u201crealisms\u201d want to pre-program and thus\ndisallow the coming of events. In this way, from the beginning of his\ncareer to its end, Lyotard never argued that all was socially\nconstructed, that all language games had equal validity, or that we\nare locked within the prison house of language. Rather, all of his\nworks attempt to testify to that which escapes language, though we\nnever stop attempting to articulate this excess. This leads to a\ndizzying array of differences among and between phrase regimens, and\nLyotard\u2019s work was to testify to the fact of these differences\nand the injustices of differends where these differences are silenced.\nThe postmodern, then, bears witness not to the fact that there are no\nfacts, but rather that those claiming a passkey to reality merely want\nto make a claim for the hegemony of one phrase regimen (e.g., the\nsciences or techno-capitalism) over all others.\n",
