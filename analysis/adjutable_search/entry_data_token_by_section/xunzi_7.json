    "main_text": "The Heart-Mind (xin)\n8. The Heart-Mind (xin)\n\nIn many respects, the heart-mind is the keystone of Xunzi\u2019s\nphilosophy, the one piece that links together all the others. The\nChinese word xin means \u201cheart\u201d, but Xunzi\nattributes such strong and varied mental processes to this organ that\none has to construe it as not only the heart but also the mind. (The\nmind was not located in the brain in premodern Chinese\nphilosophy.)\n\nFirst, the heart-mind is the organ that we use to discover the Way.\nXunzi\u2019s discussion of Heaven presents his argument that moral\nself-cultivation is a matter of correctly perceiving and then applying\nthe Way, but does not explain how we perceive the Way in the first\nplace. Elsewhere, he states explicitly that we come \u201cto know the\nWay\u201d by means of our heart-mind (Xunzi 21.5d), which\nhas three cardinal attributes: \u201cemptiness\u201d (xu\n\u865b) \u201cunity\u201d (yi \u58f9), and\n\u201ctranquility\u201d (jing \u975c). Xunzi patently\nborrowed these three terms from earlier discourse, particularly\nZhuangzi (e.g., Yearley 1980; Goldin 1999: 22\u201331;\nStalnaker 2003), and uses them to denote three nurturable faculties\nthat we all possess from birth, but do not employ to the same degree.\n(The title of the relevant chapter, \u201cResolving Blindness\u201d,\nrefers to the self-destructive acts that people undertake because they\nfail to employ their heart-minds correctly.) \u201cEmptiness\u201d\nrefers to the heart-mind\u2019s ability to store a seemingly\nunlimited amount of information: we do not have to erase one datum in\norder to make room for another. \u201cUnity\u201d refers to the\nheart-mind\u2019s ability to synthesize diverse data into meaningful\nparadigms. And \u201ctranquility\u201d refers to the\nheart-mind\u2019s ability to distinguish fantasy from rational\nthinking. Armed with these powers, we can infer the patterns of the\nWay by taking in, and then pondering, the data transmitted to the\nheart-mind by the senses.\n\nIn addition, the heart-mind is the chief among the organs. It is the\nonly organ that can command the others; indeed, it is the only organ\nwith any self-consciousness. \u201cThe mind is the lord of the body\n\u2026 It issues commands but does not receive commands\u201d\n(Xunzi 21.6a). Because the heart-mind can control both itself\nand all other organs of the body, it is the font of\n\u201cartifice\u201d, or the deliberate actions that begin to\ntransform the morally deficient xing: \u201cWhen the\nheart-mind reasons and the other faculties put it into\naction\u2014this is called \u2018artifice\u2019\u201d\n(Xunzi 22.1b). The heart-mind is capable of overriding every\nhuman impulse, even the instinct of self-preservation, if it conflicts\nwith the correct \u201cpatterns\u201d (li\n \u7406).[10]\n We have the necessary faculties to recognize immorality when we see\nit, and if we permit ourselves to tread an immoral path, we cannot\nblame our emotions or desires, but must accept that our heart-mind has\nfailed to exert the requisite discipline. We know that we could have\ndone better. Indeed, when we speak of \u201cwe\u201d, we are\nspeaking of our heart-mind. For the heart-mind is the crucible where\nthese teeming moral deliberations take place.\n\nThus Xunzi ends, like all Confucians, with individual responsibility:\nin his case, the heart-mind\u2019s obligation to process the\nprinciples of the Way and then command the rest of the body to\nconform. Because we are not sages, we are advised to follow the\nrituals in order to attain this degree of understanding, but,\nfundamentally, the path to morality is open to anyone who sees and\nthinks (Xunzi 8.11 and 23.5b).\n\nXunzi\u2019s conception of the heart-mind also figures in a\ndistinctive congruence that he postulates between a kingdom and a\nhuman being. A kingdom possesses an initial set of features\u2014it\nmay be large or small, rich or poor, hilly or flat\u2014but these are\nimmaterial to its ultimate success or failure, for any territory,\nhowever small, provides enough of a base for a sage to conquer the\nworld. Thus it is the management of the state, and not its natural\nresources, that determine whether it will become the demesne of a king\nor be conquered by its neighbors. This management, furthermore,\ncomprises two elements: a proper method, namely the rituals of the\nsage kings; and a decisive agent, namely the lord, who chooses either\nto adopt the rituals or unwisely discard them.\n\nIn much the same way, human beings are made up of two parts: their\nxing, or detestable initial condition, and wei,\ntheir conscious conduct. They may reform themselves or they may remain\ndetestable: this depends entirely on their conduct. The management of\nthe self, just like the management of the state, comprises two\nelements: a proper method, which is, once again, the rituals of the\nsage kings; and a decisive agent, which chooses either to adopt the\nrituals or unwisely discard them. This agent, the analogue of the lord\nof a state, is the heart-mind (Goldin 1999:\n 16\u201317).[11]\n As in the Broadway song, \u201cIt\u2019s not where you start;\nit\u2019s where you finish\u201d (Fields et al. 1973 [1975:\n54]).\n",
