    "main_text": "Psychological Hedonism\n1. Psychological Hedonism\n\n\nBentham's claim that pain and pleasure determine what we do\nmakes him a psychological hedonist, and more specifically a hedonist\nabout the determination of action. This section focuses instead on the\nmore modest claim that only pleasure or displeasure motivates us. This\nform of psychological hedonism helpfully allows that some hedonic\nmotivations of ours fail to determine our action, and that some of our\nhedonically determined actions fail actually to get us pleasure.\nWeakness of agency can see our motivation fail to generate our action\n(see\n weakness of will);\n and the related\n\u2018paradox of hedonism\u2019 is the plausible claim that some of\nour hedonically motivated or determined action actually secures less\npleasure than we would otherwise have got (e.g., Sidgwick: 48f).\n",
