    "main_text": "Moral Intuitions and Conceptual Analysis || Another Example: The Linguistic Analogy\n2.4 Another Example: The Linguistic Analogy\n\nAnother positive program investigates the structure and form of moral\nintuitions, in addition to their content, with the aim of using these\nfeatures to inform a theory of the cognitive structures underlying\nmoral judgment and their etiology.\n\nRawls (1971), drawing on Chomsky\u2019s (1965) theory of generative\nlinguistics, suggested that moral cognition might be usefully modeled\non our language faculty, a parallel endorsed by Chomsky himself:\n\nI don\u2019t doubt that we have a natural moral sense\u2026.That\nis, just as people somehow can construct an extraordinarily rich\nsystem of knowledge of language on the basis of rather limited and\ndegenerate experience, similarly, people develop implicit systems of\nmoral evaluation, which are more or less uniform from person to\nperson. There are differences, and the differences are interesting,\nbut over quite a substantial range we tend to make comparable\njudgments, and we do it, it would appear, in quite intricate and\ndelicate ways involving new cases and agreement often about new\ncases\u2026 and we do this on the basis of a very limited\nenvironmental context available to us. The child or the adult\ndoesn\u2019t have much information that enables the mature person to\nconstruct a moral system that will in fact apply to a rich range of\ncases, and yet that happens.\u2026whenever we see a very rich,\nintricate system developing in a more or less uniform way on the basis\nof rather restricted stimulus conditions, we have to assume that there\nis a very powerful, very rich, highly structured innate component that\nis operating in such a way as to create that highly specific system on\nthe basis of the limited data available to it. (Chomsky, quoted in\nMikhail 2005).\n\n\nHere Chomsky points to four similarities between the development of\nlinguistic knowledge and the development of moral knowledge:\n\n\nL1: A child raised in a particular linguistic community almost\ninevitably ends up speaking an idiolect of the local language despite\nlack of sufficient explicit instruction, lack of extensive negative\nfeedback for mistakes, and grammatical mistakes by caretakers.\n\nM1: A child raised in a particular moral community almost inevitably\nends up judging in accordance with an idiolect of the local moral code\ndespite lack of sufficient explicit instruction, lack of sufficient\nnegative feedback for moral mistakes, and moral mistakes by\ncaretakers.\n\nL2: While there is great diversity among natural languages, there are\nsystematic constraints on possible natural languages.\n\nM2: While there is great diversity among natural moralities, there are\nsystematic constraints on possible natural moralities.\n\nL3: Language-speakers obey many esoteric rules that they themselves\ntypically cannot articulate or explain, and which some would not even\nrecognize.\n\nM3: Moral agents judge according to esoteric rules (such as the\ndoctrine of double effect) that they themselves typically cannot\narticulate or explain, and which some would not even recognize.\n\nL4: Drawing on a limited vocabulary, a speaker can both produce and\ncomprehend a potential infinity of linguistic expressions.\n\nM4: Drawing on a limited moral vocabulary, an agent can produce and\nevaluate a very large (though perhaps not infinite) class of\naction-plans, which are ripe for moral judgment.\n\n\nWe will now explain and evaluate each of these pairs of claims in\nturn.\n\nL1/M1 refer to Chomsky\u2019s poverty of the stimulus\nargument: despite receiving little explicit linguistic and grammatical\ninstruction, children develop language rapidly and at a young age, and\nquickly come to display competence applying complex grammatical rules.\nSimilarly, Mikhail and other proponents of the analogy argue that\nchildren acquire moral knowledge at a young age based on relatively\nlittle explicit instruction. However, critics of the analogy point out\nseveral points of difference. First, children actually receive quite a\nbit of explicit moral instruction and correction, and in contrast with\nthe linguistic case, this often takes the form of explicit statements\nof moral rules: \u2018don\u2019t hit,\u2019 \u2018share,\u2019\nand so on. Secondly, there is debate over the age at which children\nactually display moral competence. Paul Bloom (2013; see also Blake,\nMcAuliffe, and Warneken 2014) has argued that babies display moral\ntendencies as early as 3\u20136 months, but others (most famously\nKohlberg (1969) and Piaget (1970)) have argued that children are not\nfully competent with moral judgment until as late as 8\u201312 years,\nby which time they have received quite a bit of moral instruction,\nboth implicit and explicit. A related point concerns the ability to\nreceive instructions: in the case of language, a child requires some\nlinguistic knowledge or understanding in order even to receive\ninstruction: a child who has no understanding of language will not\nunderstand instructions given to her. But in the moral case, a child\nneed not understand moral rules in order to be instructed in them, so\nthere is less need to posit some innate knowledge or understanding.\nNichols et al. (2016) have conducted a series of experiments using\nstatistical learning and Bayesian modeling to show how children might\nlearn complex rules with scant input (see also Nichols 2021). Finally,\nwhile children may initially acquire the moral values present in their\nenvironment, they sometimes change their values or develop their own\nvalues later in life in ways that present spontaneously and with\nlittle conscious effort. This is in marked contrast with language; as\nany second-language learner will recognize, acquiring a new language\nlater in life is effortful and, even if one succeeds in achieving\nfluency, the first language is rarely lost. Lastly, as Prinz (2008)\npoints out, children are punished for moral violations, which may\nexplain why they are quicker to learn moral than grammatical\nrules.\n\nL2/M2 refer to the existence of so-called linguistic\nuniversals: structures present in all known languages. Whether\nthis is true in the moral case is controversial, for reasons\nwe\u2019ll discuss further below. Prinz (2008) and Sripada (2004)\nhave argued that there are no exceptionless moral universals,\nunless one phrases or describes the norms in question in such a way as\nto render them vacuous. Sripada uses the example \u2018murder is\nwrong\u2019 as a vacuous rule: while this might seem like a plausible\ncandidate for a moral universal, when we consider that\n\u2018murder\u2019 refers to a wrongful act of killing, we can see\nthat the norm is not informative. But Mikhail might respond by\nclaiming that the fact that all cultures recognize a subset of\nintentional killings as morally wrong, even if they differ in how they\ncircumscribe this subset, is itself significant, and the relevant\nanalogy here would be with the existence of categories like\n\u2018subject\u2019, \u2018verb\u2019, and \u2018object\u2019 in\nall languages, or with features like recursion, which are present in\nthe grammars of all natural languages (but see Everett 2005).\n\nL3/M3 refer to the patterns displayed by grammatical and moral\nintuitions. In the case of language, native speakers can recognize\ngrammatical and ungrammatical constructions relatively easily, but\ntypically cannot articulate the rules underlying these intuitions. In\nthe case of moral grammar, the analogy claims, the same is true: we\nproduce moral intuitions effortlessly without being able to explain\nthe rules underlying them. Indeed, in both cases, the rules underlying\nthe judgments might be quite esoteric and difficult for native\nspeakers to learn and understand.\n\nL4/M4 refer to the fact that we can embed linguistic phrases within\nother linguistic phrases to create novel and increasingly complex\nphrases and sentences. This property is known as recursion,\nand is present in all known natural languages (indeed, Chomsky\nsuggests that perhaps recursion is the only linguistic universal; see\nHauser, Chomsky & Fitch 2002; but see Everett 2005). For\ninstance, just as phrases can be embedded in other phrases to form\nmore complex phrases:\n\nthe calico cat \\(\\rightarrow\\) the calico cat (that the dog chased)\n\\(\\rightarrow\\) the calico cat (that the dog [that the breeding\nconglomerate wanted] chased) \\(\\rightarrow\\) the calico cat (that the\ndog [that the breeding conglomerate{that was bankrupt} wanted] chased)\n\n\nso the descriptions of actions that are morally assessed can be\nembedded in other action descriptions to produce novel action\ndescriptions (Harman 2008, 346). For example:\n\nIt\u2019s wrong to \\(x \\rightarrow\\) It\u2019s wrong to coerce\nsomeone to \\(x \\rightarrow\\) It\u2019s wrong to persuade someone to\ncoerce someone to \\(x\\).\n\n\nThe point is twofold: first, we can create complex action\ndescriptions; second, we can evaluate novel and complex actions and\nrespond with relatively automatic intuitions of grammatical or moral\npermissibility.\n\nMikhail (2011: 43\u201348) uses experimental evidence of judgments\nabout trolley problems to argue that our moral judgments are generated\nby imposing a deontic structure on our representation of the causal\nand evaluative features of the action under consideration. Mikhail\npoints to a variation on the poverty of the stimulus argument, which\nhe calls the poverty of the perceptual stimulus (Mikhail\n2009: 37): when faced with a particular moral situation, we draw\ncomplex inferences about both act and actor based on relatively little\ndata. Mikhail (2010) uses this argument against models of moral\njudgment as affect-driven intuitions:\n\nAlthough each of these rapid, intuitive, and highly automatic moral\njudgments is occasioned by an identifiable stimulus, how the brain\ngoes about interpreting these complex action descriptions and\nassigning a deontic status to each of them is not something revealed\nin any obvious way by the surface structure of the stimulus itself.\nInstead, an intervening step must be postulated: an intuitive\nappraisal of some sort that is imposed on the stimulus prior to any\ndeontic response to it. Hence, a simple perceptual model, such as the\none implicit in Haidt\u2019s (2001) influential model of moral\njudgment, appears inadequate for explaining these intuitions, a point\nthat can be illustrated by calling attention to the unanalyzed link\nbetween eliciting situation and intuitive response in Haidt\u2019s\nmodel\n\n\nUnlike the traditional poverty of the stimulus argument, this version\ndoes not rely on developmental evidence, but on our ability to quickly\nand effortlessly appraise complicated scenarios, such as variations on\ntrolley problems, in a way that is independent of their superficial\nfeatures (e.g., the way they are described), and then issue\nnormative judgments. The postulated intervening step is like the\nunconscious appeal to rules of grammar, and the evidence for such a\nstep must come from experiments showing that we do, in fact, have such\nintuitions, and that they conform to predictable patterns.\n\nThe linguistic analogy relies on experimental evidence about the\nnature and pattern of our moral intuitions, and it outlines an\nimportant role for experiments in moral theory. If the analogy holds,\nthen a descriptively adequate moral theory must be based on the\njudgments of competent moral judges (although a reformist moral theory\nneed not, or at least not to the same extent), just as grammatical\nrules are constructed based on the judgments of competent speakers. A\npressing task will be the systematic collection of such judgments. The\nanalogy also suggests a kind of rationalism about moral judgment,\nsince it posits that our judgments result from the unconscious\napplication of rules to cases. Finally, the analogy might have\nmetaethical implications. Just as we can only evaluate grammaticality\nof utterances relative to a language, it may be that we can only\nevaluate the morality of an action relative to a specific moral\nsystem. How to individuate moralities, and how many (assuming there\nare multiple ones) there are, is a question for further empirical\ninvestigation, and here again experimental evidence will play a\ncrucial role.\n",
