    "main_text": "Revising the Foundations of Deontic Logic || Hyperintensionality of Deontic Modals and Truthmaker Semantics\n6.5 Hyperintensionality of Deontic Modals and Truthmaker Semantics\n\nRecently, the puzzles related to \\(\\OB\\)-NEC, Inheritance, and Deontic\nExplosion have been taken to reflect a more general (alleged) feature\nof deontic modals, i.e., their hyperintensionality. In the\nsyntactic sense, a modal operator is hyperintensional if it is not\nclosed under the replacement of classical, truth-functionally\nequivalent formulas. On this view, \\(\\OB p\\) is, e.g., not equivalent\nto \\(\\OB\\) \\(((p \\amp q) \\vee(p \\amp \\neg q))\\), even if the truth of\n\\(p\\) always coincides with the truth of \\((p \\amp q) \\vee(p \\amp \\neg\nq)\\). Semantically, this means that such an operator cannot be\ninterpreted as an intensional modal operator, using (classical)\npossible-worlds semantics.\n\nA promising recent semantic framework for hyperintensional logics is\nthat of truthmaker semantics (Fine 2017). On such a semantics,\npropositions are interpreted by \u201ctruthmakers\u201d, resp.\n\u201cfalsemakers\u201d rather than sets of worlds, where these\nentities are related to one another in terms of a mereological\n(parthood) relation. For instance, a truthmaker for \u201cit\nrains\u201d would be simply a state of it\u2019s raining, nothing\nless and nothing more. A truthmaker for \u201c(it rains and the sun\nshines) or (it rains and the sun does not shine)\u201d can be either\nof two things: a fusion of a state of it\u2019s raining with a state\nof the sun\u2019s shining, or a fusion of a state of it\u2019s\nraining with a state of the sun\u2019s not shining (and hence, the\nlatter, a falsemaker of \u201cthe sun shines\u201d). Formally, the\nset of truthmakers of \\(p\\) may, e.g., be \\(\\{X, X'\\}\\), while the set\nof truthmakers of \\((p \\amp q) \\vee(p \\amp \\neg q)\\) may be \\(\\{X*Y,\\)\n\\(X*Z,\\) \\(X'*Z,\\) \\(X'*Z\\}\\), with the \u201c*\u201d symbol\ndenoting a fusion\n operation.[97]\n Fine applied this framework to the logic of imperatives and to\ndeontic logic proper in a series of papers (Fine 2018a,b) where\n\u201cactions\u201d play the role usually played by truthmakers in\nthe semantics of indicative sentences, and analogous to the\ntruthmaking and falsemaking relations between truthmakers and\npropositions, such actions can be either in compliance with or\ncontravening a given command. For instance, the imperative \u201cSing\nor dance!\u201d is interpreted in terms of (a) the actions that are\nin (exact) compliance with it, and (b) the actions that are in (exact)\ncontravention of it. For the case of conditional obligations,\nadditional complications arise, as one may also avoid a\nconditional by making its antecedent\n false.[98]\n Similar ideas, though worked out in different ways, can be found in\nAnglberger and Korbmacher 2020, which also relate truthmaker semantics\nto Goble\u2019s logic BDL from Goble 2013.
