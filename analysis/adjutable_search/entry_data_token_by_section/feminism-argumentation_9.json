    "main_text": "Informal Logic and Argument Interpretation || Formal logic\n3.1 Formal logic\n\nFormal logic employs artificial abstract languages generally\nunderstood to address particular types of inference. Formal symbolism\nis also used to interpret arguments from natural language so as to\nassess the strength of an argument\u2019s inference, in particular,\nwhether the argument has deductive validity. So, the argument,\n\u201cIt is icy outside and therefore I will not travel today\u201d\nmight fail to be translatable into a deductively valid form, although\npeople easily recognize its good reasoning. (\u201cMissing\npremises\u201d might be added to make the argument deductive but that\nrequires more than formal interpretation.)\n\nNye\u2019s work on formal logic, especially Words of Power: A\nFeminist Reading of the History of Logic (1990), provides the\npoint of departure for many of the initial feminist philosophical\ndiscussions of argument and arguing. Nye considers certain historical\npoints when deductive logic\u2019s operation as the default\ninterpretive mechanism for arguments may have had an oppressive\ninfluence. Rather than arguing for this interpretation, she adopts a\npractice of \u201creading\u201d that includes attention, listening,\nunderstanding, and responding (1990, 183), approaches that are\ntraditionally associated with rhetoric (Keith 1993). Her feminist\n\u201creading\u201d of episodes in the history of Euro-American\nlogic suggests ways in which abstract logical systems may have helped\nto justify social dominance at different moments in time. Her\n\u201creading\u201d purposefully aims to consider the personal and\npolitical desires behind logic that might motivate its prescription of\nrules for thought (Nye 1990: 9).\n\nNye begins her study with Parmenides\u2019 logic of \u201cwhat\nis\u201d, what exists beyond sensuous existence and human\ncommunities. The ensuing silence among the ancient Greeks was broken\nby Plato who addressed \u201cwhat is not\u201d through using\nrational discussion to reveal the existence of differences. For\nAristotle, this dialectic involved only men from the upper classes,\nmaking the exclusive nature of the logic most explicit. As a result,\nin Nye\u2019s view, a silence regarding a lot of reasoning surrounds\nlogic. Nye notes that\n\n\nonce rationality is defined as what is not emotional, and emotionality\nestablished as the characteristic of women understood as what is only\na body, there could be no discussion of institutions of slavery and\nsexism. (1990: 50)\n\n\nShe traces through medieval formulations of logic ways in which the\nclaims of logic\u2019s universal application may have discouraged\ncriticism of social institutions that authorized those accounts of\nlogic. These institutions include patriarchy in general, sometimes\nunderwritten by God, the Roman Empire, and the Catholic Church.\n\nLogical restriction on what counts as reasoning culminates, on\nNye\u2019s reading, when Gottlob Frege moves logic out of human\ndiscourse to formulate it in a symbolic language. Frege\u2019s\nfunctionalist notation promises to express all forms of truth with the\naim, Nye suggests, \u201cthat thought will be unified and logical\nerrors in science, mathematics, and philosophy exposed\u201d (1990:\n131). Using Frege\u2019s approach, how a concept refers to the world\nbecomes \u201can objective fact:\u2026one cannot invent its\nvalue\u201d (1990: 135). As a result, the institutions that render\nconcepts meaningful, including the social institution of language,\nstand beyond question, creating a new form of muteness that harkens\nback to Parmenides. The surrounding silence breaks again when the\nVienna Circle adds empirical input in place of the concepts on which\nthe Fregean functions work. Nye indicates that this theoretical\ndevelopment places science above meaningful criticism, and so allows\nscientific reasoning to be co-opted by authoritarian regimes (1990:\n163\u2013171).\n\nAs an alternative to logic, Nye suggests building confidence for women\nand developing new concepts aided by a concrete (natural, not\nartificial) \u201cwomen\u2019s language\u201d. Discourse that is\nfor or about women might provide inclusion, bonding, and ways to share\npower. Women have relied historically on the skills needed for\nreading:\n\n\nWe have listened and read to survive, we have read to predict the\nmaneuvers of those in power over us, to seduce those who might help\nus, to pacify bullies, to care for children, to nurse the sick and the\nwounded. (1990: 184)\n\n\nThe next step lies in developing the language to respond.\n\nNye\u2019s experiment in avoiding argument falters in two ways\nobserved by feminists and other scholars who have not been convinced\nby her socio-historical reading. Some cite errors in her historical\ninterpretation (Keith 1993; Weiner 1994). Others find that in\nWords of Power, Nye does argue, but fails to persuade and so\nfails to provide the alternative to logic she seeks (Gilbert 1994;\nAyim 1995).\n\nGilbert offers a related but distinct criticism of formal logic for\nits role in the \u201cCritical-Logical\u201d approach that he\ncharacterizes as extracting text from utterances for the purposes of\napplying a competitive or eristic process to the stylized text (1994).\nHe suggests, like Moulton (1983), that such abstraction serves the\ncompetitive functions and standard practice of Euro-American academic\nphilosophy. Because arguing need not adhere to the Critical-Logical\nmodel, it remains possible that feminine styles of reasoning may\nground effective interpretive practices for arguers. Arguing also may\nfind natural corollaries in other styles of communication and other\nvalues that operate within communication.\n\nReasoners appeal to logic and to other abstract accounts of what other\narguers say partly so they might avoid bias as they interpret natural\nlanguage. Yet such abstract interpretation may favor forms of argument\nevaluation unsuited to the context of utterance. For instance, if the\nCritical-Logical model of argument evaluation provides the basis for\nlegal procedures, then it may compromise access to justice for people\nwho are socially marginalized based on gender, race, class, and\neducation. Gilbert echoes Nye\u2019s concern that logical systems can\nreflect the lingua franca of the ruling class that captures\ntheir own interests (1994: 105). Applying it to other contexts risks\ndistorting and disenfranchising other people and their modes of\ncommunication.\n\nNye concedes that a women\u2019s language cannot stand up to the\npower and authority of logic but believes that perhaps reasoners may\ngain something different from a replacement for logic. It may be\nthat\n\n\nher notion of reading teaches that the circumstances in which\nsomething is said and the person who says it are relevant\nconsiderations. (Tindale 1999: 196)\n\n\nThe appeal of Nye\u2019s \u201creading\u201d may be that\n\n\ncurrently popular theories of reading, unlike traditional logic,\nhighlight rather than diminish the interests, personality, and motives\nthat the reader brings to the task of reading. (Ayim 1995: 807)\n\n\nArguers can emphasize the moral goals behind an argument through their\nemotional language. Likewise, an explanatory purpose for an argument\nwould mean that the speaker offers it up as a truthful description\nrather than as a subject for debate (Gilbert 1994). Such purposes and\nvalues can fall away with the abstraction of a premise-conclusion\ncomplex from its context of utterance. When the Critical-Logical model\ngrounds decision-making processes, the authority it carries creates\nproblems for anyone using other styles of reasoning and\ncommunication.\n\nNote that Nye is the only feminist philosopher to date suggesting a\nsubstitute for arguing and logic. Ayim (1995) and Gilbert (1994)\nstress that different styles of communication and value-systems can be\nnatural corollaries for each other. Govier (1993) further suggests\nthat the power of universal logic may be indispensable, and that\nfeminist concerns can be addressed through a better understanding of\nthe interpretation and application of logical norms.\n",
