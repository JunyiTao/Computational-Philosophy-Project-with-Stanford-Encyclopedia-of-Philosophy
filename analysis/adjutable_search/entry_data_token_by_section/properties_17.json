    "main_text": "Complex Properties || Logically Compound Properties\n4.1 Logically Compound Properties\n\nAt least prima facie, our use of complex predicates suggests\nthat there are corresponding complex properties involving all sorts of\nlogical operations. Thus, one can envisage conjunctive\nproperties such as blue and spherical, negative properties\nsuch as non-spherical, disjunctive properties such\nas blue or non-spherical, existentially or\nuniversally quantified properties such as loving\nsomeone or loved by everyone, reflexive\nproperties such as loving oneself, etc. Moreover, one could\nadd to the list properties with individuals as constituents, which are\nthen denied the status of a purely qualitative property,\ne.g., taller than Obama.\n\nIt is easy to construct complex predicates. But whether there really\nare corresponding properties of this kind is a much more difficult and\ncontroversial issue, tightly bound to the sparse/abundant distinction.\nIn the sparse conception the tendency is to dispense with them. This\nis understandable since in this camp one typically postulates\nproperties in rebus for empirical explanatory reasons. But\nthen, if we explain some phenomena by attributing properties \\(F\\) and\n\\(G\\) to an object, while denying that it does not exemplify \\(H\\), it\nseems of no value to add that it also has, say, F and G,\nF or H, and non-H. Nevertheless, Armstrong, the\nleading supporter of sparseness, has defended over the years a mixed\nstance without disjunctive and negative properties, but with\nconjunctive ones. Armstrong\u2019s line has of course its opponents\n(see, e.g., Paolini Paoletti 2014; 2017a; 2020a; Zangwill 2011 argues\nthat there are negative properties, but they are less real than\npositive ones). On the other hand, in the abundant conception, all\nsorts of logically compound properties are acknowledged. Since the\nfocus now is on meaning and mental content, it appears natural to\npostulate such properties to account for our understanding of complex\npredicates and of how they differ from simple ones. Even here,\nhowever, there are disagreements, when it comes to problematic\npredicates such the \u201cdoes not exemplify itself\u201d of\nRussell\u2019s paradox. Some suggest that in this case one should\ndeny there is a corresponding property, in order to avoid the paradox\n(Van Inwagen 2006). However, we understand this predicate and thus it\nseems ad hoc that the general strategy of postulating a\nproperty fails. It seems better to confront the paradox with other\nmeans (see\n \u00a76).\n",
