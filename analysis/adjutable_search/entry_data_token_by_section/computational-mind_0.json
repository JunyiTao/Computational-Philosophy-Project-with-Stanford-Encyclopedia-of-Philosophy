    "main_text": "Turing machines\n1. Turing machines\nThe intuitive notions of computation\nand algorithm are central to mathematics. Roughly speaking,\nan algorithm is an explicit, step-by-step procedure for answering some\nquestion or solving some problem. An algorithm provides routine\nmechanical instructions dictating how to proceed at each\nstep. Obeying the instructions requires no special ingenuity or\ncreativity. For example, the familiar grade-school algorithms describe\nhow to compute addition, multiplication, and division. Until the early\ntwentieth century, mathematicians relied upon informal notions of\ncomputation and algorithm without attempting anything like a formal\nanalysis. Developments in the foundations of mathematics eventually\nimpelled logicians to pursue a more systematic treatment. Alan\nTuring\u2019s landmark paper \u201cOn Computable Numbers, With\nan Application to the Entscheidungsproblem\u201d (Turing 1936)\noffered the analysis that has proved most influential.\nA Turing machine is an abstract model of an idealized\ncomputing device with unlimited time and storage space at its\ndisposal. The device manipulates symbols, much as a human\ncomputing agent manipulates pencil marks on paper during arithmetical\ncomputation. Turing says very little about the nature of symbols. He\nassumes that primitive symbols are drawn from a finite alphabet. He\nalso assumes that symbols can be inscribed or erased at \u201cmemory\nlocations\u201d. Turing\u2019s model works as follows:\n\nThere are infinitely many memory locations, arrayed in a linear\nstructure. Metaphorically, these memory locations are\n\u201ccells\u201d on an infinitely long \u201cpaper\ntape\u201d. More literally, the memory locations might be physically\nrealized in various media (e.g., silicon chips).\nThere is a central processor, which can access one memory location\nat a time. Metaphorically, the central processor is a\n\u201cscanner\u201d that moves along the paper tape one\n\u201ccell\u201d at a time.\nThe central processor can enter into finitely many machine\nstates.\nThe central processor can perform four elementary operations:\nwrite a symbol at a memory location; erase a symbol from a memory\nlocation; access the next memory location in the linear array\n(\u201cmove to the right on the tape\u201d); access the previous\nmemory location in the linear array (\u201cmove to the left on the\ntape\u201d).\nWhich elementary operation the central processor performs depends\nentirely upon two facts: which symbol is currently inscribed at the\npresent memory location; and the scanner\u2019s own current machine\nstate.\nA machine table dictates which elementary operation the\ncentral processor performs, given its current machine state and the\nsymbol it is currently accessing. The machine table also dictates how\nthe central processor\u2019s machine state changes given those same\nfactors. Thus, the machine table enshrines a finite set of routine\nmechanical instructions governing computation.\n\nTuring translates this informal description into a rigorous\nmathematical model. For more details, see the entry\non Turing machines.\nTuring motivates his approach by reflecting on idealized human\ncomputing agents. Citing finitary limits on our perceptual and\ncognitive apparatus, he argues that any symbolic algorithm executed by\na human can be replicated by a suitable Turing machine. He concludes\nthat the Turing machine formalism, despite its extreme simplicity, is\npowerful enough to capture all humanly executable mechanical\nprocedures over symbolic configurations. Subsequent discussants have\nalmost universally agreed.\nTuring computation is often described as digital rather\nthan analog. What this means is not always so clear, but the\nbasic idea is usually that computation operates over discrete\nconfigurations.  By comparison, many historically important algorithms\noperate over continuously variable configurations. For example,\nEuclidean geometry assigns a large role to ruler-and-compass\nconstructions, which manipulate geometric shapes. For any shape,\none can find another that differs to an arbitrarily small\nextent. Symbolic configurations manipulated by a Turing machine do not\ndiffer to arbitrarily small extent. Turing machines operate over\ndiscrete strings of elements (digits) drawn from a finite\nalphabet. One recurring controversy concerns whether the digital\nparadigm is well-suited to model mental activity or whether an analog\nparadigm would instead be more fitting (MacLennan 2012; Piccinini and\nBahar 2013).\nBesides introducing Turing machines, Turing (1936) proved\nseveral seminal mathematical results involving them. In particular, he\nproved the existence of a universal Turing machine (UTM).\nRoughly speaking, a UTM is a Turing machine that can mimic any other\nTuring machine. One provides the UTM with a symbolic input that codes\nthe machine table for Turing machine M. The UTM\nreplicates M\u2019s behavior, executing instructions\nenshrined by M\u2019s machine table. In that sense, the UTM\nis a programmable general purpose computer. To a first\napproximation, all personal computers are also general purpose: they\ncan mimic any Turing machine, when suitably programmed. The main\ncaveat is that physical computers have finite memory, whereas a Turing\nmachine has unlimited memory. More accurately, then, a personal\ncomputer can mimic any Turing machine until it exhausts its\nlimited memory supply.\nTuring\u2019s discussion helped lay the foundations\nfor computer science, which seeks to design, build, and\nunderstand computing systems. As we know, computer scientists can now\nbuild extremely sophisticated computing machines. All these machines\nimplement something resembling Turing computation, although the\ndetails differ from Turing\u2019s simplified model.\n",
