    "main_text": "\n\nCharles Sanders Peirce was a philosopher, but it is not easy to\nclassify him in philosophy because of the breadth of his work. (Please\nrefer to the table of contents of the entry\n Charles Sanders Peirce.)\n Logic was one of the main topics on which Peirce wrote. If we focus\non logic, however, it becomes apparent that both Peirce\u2019s\nconcept of logic and his work on logic were much broader than his\npredecessors\u2019, his contemporaries\u2019, and ours. First,\nPeirce located logic in his large architectonic framework of\nphilosophy, which is why some strongly believe that Peirce\u2019s\nlogic cannot be properly understood without understanding his\npragmatism and his semiotics, to mention but two of his other\ncontributions. Even within the traditional boundaries of logic, Peirce\nmade too many contributions to outline in a single article.\n\nAcknowledging the nature of this next-to-impossible task, we single\nout the common theme of Peirce\u2019s various contributions to modern\nlogic\u2014to extend logic, as characterized by the three different\ndimensions: \n\n the scope of formalism (from monadic to relations), \n the kinds of systems (from symbolic to diagrammatic systems), and\n\n semantic values (from bivalence to three values).\n\n\nThe main goal of this entry is not only to present Peirce\u2019s\naccomplishments in each of these three extensions, but also to explore\nthe relations, if any, among these novel developments. The three\nsections of the entry will be devoted, respectively, to each of these\nthree ways how the horizon of deductive logic is expanded by\nPeirce.\n\nPeirce\u2019s journey on formal deductive logic started with Boolean\ncalculus and De Morgan\u2019s logic of relatives. Boolean algebra\ncreated a path to generalize Aristotelian syllogism and De\nMorgan\u2019s ambition to formalize relations opened a new territory\nto conquer. However, Peirce\u2019s predicate logic is neither a\nmechanical expansion from the existing logics nor a simple combination\nof these two. A leap made by Peirce from his contemporary logic is\nqualitatively substantial enough to call Peirce a founder of modern\ndeductive logic, as the entry explains. The first section explores\nPeirce\u2019s development of predicate logic presented in his several\nwell-known papers, by locating the root of Peirce\u2019s introduction\nof quantifiers and bound variables. While formal details and notations\nof Peirce\u2019s first-order logic can be overwhelming, one should\nnot lose the sight of the bigger picture by paying attention to the\nmain motivation behind Peirce\u2019s enterprise for a new logic.\nConquering new territory\u2014relations\u2014with new formal\nnotation, Peirce\u2019s adventure was launched into another\ndimension\u2014a new mode of representation, that is, diagrammatic\nrepresentation. This is the topic of the second section. While two\nsystems of Peirce\u2019s Existential Graphs (\u201cEG\u201d\nhenceforth) are presented, the following perspective is at the\nbackground: Peirce\u2019s EG were not invented just as random\nalternatives, logically equivalent to his own predicate logical\nnotation, but a reflection of Peirce\u2019s new approach to logic and\nformalization. As Peirce\u2019s tireless attempts for predicate logic\nbrought to us more powerful formal notation, Peirce\u2019s search for\nbetter representation of relational states of affairs was pursued\nbeyond his own symbolic system. Spatial, as opposed to linear,\nnotation is still not familiar to some of us, and the second section\nintroduces the basic notational aspects of Peirce\u2019s EG, and\ndiscusses the fundamental differences between EG and symbolic systems.\nThe third section about three-valued logic examines another new\nenterprise of Peirce, not in syntactic notation, but in semantic\nvalues. Peirce scholars propose various motivations behind\nPeirce\u2019s three value semantics and those different views will be\nbriefly discussed.\n\nWhile the first contribution, that is, an extension from monadic to\npredicate logic, has positioned Peirce as a founder of modern logic\nalong with Frege, it took much longer for Peirce\u2019s other\nachievements to receive proper attention from logicians or\nphilosophers. The entry aims to draw a road map for Peirce\u2019s\njourney in deductive logic so that one may realize his accomplishments\nare very much connected with each other. More specifically,\nPeirce\u2019s achievements in deductive logic were accumulative.\nAfter being able to formalize polyadic relations with new symbolic\nnotation, Peirce devised a totally new form of\nrepresentation\u2014diagrammatic systems. What we can formalize is\nextended and how we can formalize what we can formalize is\nextended. And Peirce ventured into what our formalization represents\nand suggested a more fine-grained or a bigger territory of semantic\nvalues than binary True or False values.\n",
