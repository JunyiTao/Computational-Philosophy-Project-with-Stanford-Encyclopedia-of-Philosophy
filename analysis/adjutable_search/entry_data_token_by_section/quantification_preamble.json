    "main_text": "\n\nQuantifier expressions are marks of generality. They come in many\nsyntactic categories in English, but determiners like\n\u201call\u201d, \u201ceach\u201d, \u201csome\u201d,\n\u201cmany\u201d, \u201cmost\u201d, and \u201cfew\u201d provide\nsome of the most common examples of\n quantification.[1]\n In English, they combine with singular or plural nouns, sometimes\nqualified by adjectives or relative clauses, to form explicitly\nrestricted quantifier phrases such as \u201csome apples\u201d,\n\u201cevery material object\u201d, or \u201cmost planets\u201d.\nThese quantifier phrases may in turn combine with predicates in order\nto form sentences such as \u201csome apples are delicious\u201d,\n\u201cevery material object is extended\u201d, or \u201cmost\nplanets are visible to the naked eye\u201d. We may conceive of\ndeterminers like \u201cevery\u201d and \u201csome\u201d as binary\nquantifiers of the form \\(Q(A,B)\\), which may operate on two\npredicates, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), in order to form a sentence.\n\nBinary quantifiers of this sort played an important role in what is\nperhaps the first formal study of quantification developed by\nAristotle in the Prior Analytics. The details of\nAristotle\u2019s syllogistic logic are given in the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s Logic.\n Aristotle investigated a restricted class of inferential patterns,\nwhich he called syllogisms, in which two categorical\npropositions served as premises and a third served as a\nconclusion. A categorical proposition is a sentence obtained from one\nof four binary quantifiers \u201c\\(all(A, B)\\)\u201d,\n\u201c\\(some(A, B)\\)\u201d, \u201c\\(no(A, B)\\)\u201d and\n\u201c\\(not \\ all(A, B)\\)\u201d, when suitable predicates are\nsubstituted for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). In a syllogism, each categorical\nproposition contains two of three shared predicates. The logical\nrelations, which, according to Aristotelian logic, obtain between them\nare codified by\n the square of opposition.\n Although Aristotle\u2019s syllogistic logic dominated logic for\ncenturies, it eventually revealed itself inadequate for the\nrepresentation of mathematical argumentation. Aristotelian logic\nfinally became displaced by the advent of modern quantificational\nlogic, which originated with George Boole\u2019s algebraic approach\nto logic and Gottlob Frege\u2019s approach to logic and\nquantification (1879).\n\nModern quantificational logic has chosen to focus instead on formal\ncounterparts of the unary quantifiers \u201ceverything\u201d and\n\u201csomething\u201d, which may be written \\(\\forall x\\) and\n\\(\\exists x\\), respectively. They are unary quantifiers because they\nrequire a single argument in order to form a sentence of the form\n\\(\\forall xA\\) or \\(\\exists xA\\). Frege (and Russell) devised an\ningenious procedure for regimenting binary quantifiers like\n\u201cevery\u201d and \u201csome\u201d in terms of unary\nquantifiers like \u201ceverything\u201d and \u201csomething\u201d:\nthey formalized sentences of the form \\(\\ulcorner\\)Some \\(A\\) is\n\\(B\\)\\(\\urcorner\\) and \\(\\ulcorner\\)Every \\(A\\) is \\(B\\)\\(\\urcorner\\)\nas \\(\\exists x(Ax \\wedge Bx)\\) and \\(\\forall x(Ax \\rightarrow Bx)\\),\nrespectively. They analyzed a sentence like \u201csome apples are\ndelicious\u201d in terms of the sentence \u201csomething is an apple\nand delicious\u201d, whereas they parsed the sentence \u201cevery\nmaterial object is extended\u201d as \u201ceverything is extended,\nif it is a material object\u201d. Unfortunately, this procedure\ncannot be generalized to cover quantifier phrases like\n\u201cmany\u201d, \u201cmost\u201d, or \u201cfew\u201d. It would\nbe a mistake to regiment the sentence \u201cmost planets are visible\nto the naked eye\u201d by means of \u201cmost things are planets and\nvisible to the naked eye\u201d or \u201cmost things are such that\nthey are visible to the naked eye, if they are planets\u201d.\nInstead, they are better analyzed as irreducibly binary quantifiers,\nand their study has given rise to the theory of generalized\nquantifiers, which has become a fruitful subject of study partly\nbecause of its applications in the semantics of natural language.\n",
