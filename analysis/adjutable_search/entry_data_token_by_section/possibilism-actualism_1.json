    "main_text": "The Origins and Nature of Possibilia || Possibilism and the Bi-Modal Conception of Being\n2.1 Possibilism and the Bi-Modal Conception of Being\n\nTo fully appreciate what is at issue in the possibilism-actualism\ndebate, as well as its framing in those terms, it is important to see\nits origins\u2014more generally, the origins of the bi-modal\nconception of being\u2014in the ancient, and vexing, philosophical\nproblem of\n non-existent objects.\n Inklings of the bi-modal conception arguably trace back to the dawn\nof western philosophy in the goddess\u2019s enigmatic warning to\n Parmenides\n not to be deceived by the \u201cunmanageable\u201d idea \u201cthat\nthings that are not\n are\u201d.[6]\n It finds clearer expression in Seneca\u2019s description of the\nStoics, for whom being included both physical objects and\n\u201cincorporeals\u201d\n(\u1f00\u03c3\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1) that \u201chave a\nderivative kind of reality\u201d (de Harven 2015: 406):\n\n\nThe Stoics want to place above this [the existent] yet another, more\nprimary genus\u2026. Some Stoics consider \u201csomething\u201d\nthe first genus, and I shall add the reason why they do. In nature,\nthey say, some things exist, some do not exist. But nature includes\neven those which do not exist\u2014things which enter the mind, such\nas centaurs, giants, and whatever else falsely formed by thought takes\non some image despite lacking substance. (Seneca, Letters\n58:13\u201315, quoted in Long & Sedley 1987: 162; see also Caston\n1999.)\n\n\nThe Stoics\u2019 motivation for their bifurcation of\n\u201cnature\u201d was clearly to explain the\n intentionality\n of our thought and discourse, our apparent ability to think and talk\nas coherently about the creatures of mythology and fiction as about\nordinary physical existents. Later variations broadened the\nStoics\u2019 realm of incorporeal intentional objects to include\npossibilia. In the early medieval period, the Islamic\nMutazilite theologians distinguished between thing\n(shay\u02b9) and existent (mawj\u016bd)) to\ncomport with two passages of the Qu\u02b9ran (16:40, 36:82) suggesting\nthat God commands non-existent things into existence\n(Wisnovski 2003: 147). Avicenna (1926: 54-56) under the influence of\nthe Mutazilates, was more explicit still that these non-existent\nthings are possibilia:\n\n\nIt is necessary with respect to everything that came into existence\nthat before it came into existence, it was in itself possibly\nexistent. For if it had not been possibly existent in itself, it never\nwould exist at all. Moreover, the possibility of its existence does\nnot consist in the fact that an agent could produce it or that an\nagent has power over it. Indeed, an agent would scarcely have power\nover it, if the thing itself were not possible in\n itself.[7]\n\n\nSimilar ideas were espoused by a number of other prominent medieval\nphilosophers including\n Giles of Rome,\n Henry of Ghent,\n John Duns Scotus,\n William of Ockham, and\n Francisco Suarez.[8]\n\nAlthough the grounds of possibility and intentionality were prominent\nthemes in the modern\n period,[9]\n the idea of explaining them in terms of any sort of bifurcation of\nbeing largely receded until the early nineteenth century beginning,\nnotably, with the remarkable work of\n Bernard Bolzano.\n Specifically, in his work on the ground of possibility, Bolzano\ndeveloped a sophisticated bi-modal account of being on which\neverything there is divides into those things\n(Dinge) with Wirklichkeit, usually rendered\n\u201cactuality\u201d by Bolzano\u2019s\n translators,[10]\n and those with Bestand, typically rendered\n\u201csubsistence\u201d. Importantly, for Bolzano as well as for\nmany of his successors, to be actual (wirklich) is to be part\nof the causal order and, hence, typically at any rate, to occupy a\nposition in space and time\u2014in a word (as commonly understood),\nto be\n concrete.[11]\n Subsistence, by contrast, is the mode of being shared by non-concrete\nobjects, which in particular for Bolzano included both\npossibilia and abstracta like numbers and\npropositions. Unlike abstracta, however, Bolzano\u2019s\npossibilia are only contingently subsistent,\ncontingently non-concrete, and, hence, are capable of\nWirklichkeit:\n\n\n[I]n addition to those things that have actuality\n(Wirklichkeit)\u2026there are others that have mere\npossibility (blo\u00dfe M\u00f6glichkeit), as well as those\nthat could never make the transition to actuality, e.g., propositions\nand truths as such (an sich). (Bolzano 1837: \u00a7483, pp.\n184\u20135)\n\n\nMotivated chiefly to provide a ground for intentionality, several\ndecades later,\n Alexius Meinong\n (1904b [1960], 1907) famously postulated a rich class of non-existent\nobjects to explain our apparent ability to conceive and talk about,\nnot only creatures of myth and fiction, but impossible objects like\nthe round square. Roughly, in Meinong\u2019s theory, for any class of\n\u201cordinary\u201d properties (konstitutorische\nBestimmungen) there is an intentional object\n(Gegenstand) having exactly those\n properties.[12]\n Presumably, then, although he did not broach the issue of possible\nobjects\n directly,[13]\n among these objects would be those having (perhaps among others) the\nproperty being a possible child of Bergoglio. However,\nimportantly, although he broadly accepted Bolzano\u2019s bi-modal\ndivision of being into concrete and subsistent\n objects,[14]\n Meinong ascribed no variety of being whatsoever to his intentional\nobjects, not even the subsistence (Bestand) enjoyed by\nabstracta like mathematical objects and\n propositions.[15]\n Although strongly influenced by Meinong, the early Russell (1903)\nspurned the idea that intentional objects are being-less but not the\nobjects themselves, save for impossibilia like the round\nsquare. Rather, he simply moved them all into the subsistent realm\nalongside the objects of mathematics, reserving the \u201cworld of\nexistence\u201d for \u201cactual objects\u201d in the\nspatio-temporal causal order (ibid., pp.\n 449\u201350):[16]\n\n\nBeing is that which belongs to\u2026every possible object\nof thought\u2026.Numbers, the Homeric gods, relations, chimeras and\nfour-dimensional spaces all have being, for if they were not entities\nof a kind, we could make no propositions about them. Thus being is a\ngeneral attribute of everything, and to mention anything is to show\nthat it is\u2026.Existence, on the contrary, is the\nprerogative of some only amongst beings\u2026.[T]his distinction\n[between being and existence] is essential, if we are ever to deny the\nexistence of anything. For what does not exist must be something, or\nit would be meaningless to deny its existence; and hence we need the\nconcept of being, as that which belongs even to the non-existent.\n\n\nRussell\u2019s thoroughgoing modal skepticism led him to exclude\npossibilia from his non-existent\n objects.[17]\n Nonetheless, were he to have admitted them into his ontology, the\nsubsistent realm would be their natural place in his bifurcated\nontology. Quine (1948: 22), in the voice of his fictional possibilist\nmetaphysician Wyman\u2014and undoubtedly influenced at the time by\nrecent work of C. I. Lewis (1943) and Rudolf Carnap\n (1947)[18]\u2014made\n exactly this move in a justly famous and widely-cited paper that\nplayed a pivotal role in both framing the philosophical issues and\nfixing modern terminology:\n\n\nPegasus\u2026has his being as an unactualized possible. When we say\nof Pegasus that there is no such thing, we are saying, more precisely,\nthat Pegasus does not have the special attribute of actuality. Saying\nthat Pegasus is not actual is on a par, logically, with saying that\nthe Parthenon is not red; in either case we are saying something about\nan entity whose being is unquestioned. (1948: 22)\n\n\nTo be a mere possibile, then, according to Wyman, is to be\nunactualized, i.e., it is, unqualifiedly, to be but\nto fail to exemplify \u201cthe special attribute of actuality\u201d;\nit is to subsist rather than to exist (Quine 1948:\n 23).[19]\n But perhaps equally important for fixing the nature of the modern\npossibilism-actualism debate was Quine\u2019s explicit break from his\nnineteenth and early twentieth century predecessors on the ontological\nstatus of abstracta; speaking now in his own voice, he\nsays:\n\n\nIf Pegasus existed he would indeed be in space and time, but only\nbecause the word \u201cPegasus\u201d has spatio-temporal\nconnotations, and not because \u201cexists\u201d has spatio-temporal\nconnotations. If spatio-temporal reference is lacking when we affirm\nthe existence of the cube root of 27, this is simply because a cube\nroot is not a spatio-temporal kind of thing, and not because we are\nbeing ambiguous in our use of \u201cexist\u201d. (1948: 23)\n\n\nFor Quine, that is, their necessary non-concreteness notwithstanding,\nabstract objects exist no less robustly than we and, hence, in the\ncontext of the possibilism-actualism debate, are fully\n actual.[20]\n A particular advantage of this view of abstracta for the\ndebate is that, assuming that there could be no necessarily\nnon-actual objects, possibilia are the only things lacking\nactuality in the possibilist\u2019s universe and, hence, actualism\ncan take a particularly common and familiar form:\n\nAct*:\nNecessarily, everything is actual.\n\n\nThat is, more formally put once again:\n\nAct\\(\\astAbang\\):\n\u00a0\\(\\Box\\forall \\sfx\\,\\sfA!\\sfx\\)\n\n\nBut the most important consequence of this wholesale shift in the\nontological status of abstracta is that it opened the door to\nperhaps the most prominent form of contemporary actualism\u2014dubbed\n(rather tendentiously) ersatz modal realism by David Lewis\n(1986: \u00a73.1)\u2014on which modal phenomena are understood in\nterms of abstracta of various sorts and, hence, in terms of\nactually existing things only, as per\n Act*.[21]\n (Ersatz modal realism is discussed in more detail in\n \u00a74.2\n and\n \u00a74.4\n below and in \u00a72.2 of the Encyclopedia\u2019s entry on\n possible worlds.)\n\nOne final matter requires attention. Quine\u2019s choice of Pegasus\nas his paradigmatic possibile in the above quote highlights\nthe fact that even relatively modern discussions often conflate the\ntwo motivations for non-existent objects and, consequently, conflate\nfictional objects and possibilia, and this leads to an\nimportant confusion about the nature of possibilia that is\nimportant to avoid. It is particularly evident in another well-known\nQuinean passage. Returning to his own voice, in an attempt to show\nthat possibilism is ultimately incoherent, Quine asks a series of\nrhetorical questions, beginning with the following:\n\n\nTake, for instance, the [merely] possible fat man in that doorway;\nand, again, the [merely] possible bald man in that doorway. Are they\nthe same possible man, or two possible men? How do we decide? How many\npossible men are there in that doorway? (1948: 23)\n\n\nThat is, on this characterization of possibilism, a merely possible\nF is something that (contingently) fails to be actual but,\nnonetheless, like a Meinongian intentional object, is\nactually an F\u2014a merely possible man in that\ndoorway has the property of being in the given doorway; hence the\npurportedly unanswerable questions about whether or not he is\nidentical with the indefinitely many other merely possible but\nsomewhat differently described men who can also be said to occupy the\nsame space. However, as Linsky and Zalta (1994: 445) emphasize, a\nmerely possible F needn\u2019t (and indeed typically\nwon\u2019t) be an F. Rather, a merely possible F is\n(typically) something that is not in fact an F but\nrather only could be an\n F.[22]\n In particular, a merely possible bald man in that doorway is neither\nbald, nor a man, nor in that doorway\u2014indeed, it has the\ncomplements of all those properties. Rather, it is only something that\ncould have those properties.\n\nWith that problem corrected, this Quinean framing has by and large\nbecome the dominant conception of the possibilism-actualism\ndistinction in the contemporary\n literature.[23]\n",
