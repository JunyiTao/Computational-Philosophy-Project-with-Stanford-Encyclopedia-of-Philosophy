    "main_text": "Outstanding Issues || The Wrong Kind of Reason Problem\n3.1 The Wrong Kind of Reason Problem\n\nPerhaps the most famous challenge to FA theories is what\u2019s known\nas the Wrong Kind of Reason problem (WKR problem). At a first pass,\nthe WKR problem is the problem that, at least sometimes, it seems that\nwhat\u2019s valuable doesn\u2019t correspond to what there\u2019s\nreason to value. For example, consider an FA theory like\nScanlon\u2019s buck-passing view from section 1.5, which entails that\nsomething is valuable if and only if (and because) there are reasons\nfor just anyone to value it. The trouble is that, intuitively, there\ncan be reasons to value things that have no value as well as reasons\nnot to value things that do have value. To adapt an example from Roger\nCrisp (2000), suppose an evil demon will kill you unless you value a\ncup of mud. This fact seems like a reason to value the cup, but the\ncup, being a cup of mud, has no value. Hence, an FA theory like\nScanlon\u2019s buck-passing view seems sometimes to predict that the\nobject of a valuing attitude has value when, intuitively, it\ndoesn\u2019t. Similarly, consider an FA theory that explains facts\nabout what\u2019s valuable in terms of facts about what there\u2019s\nsufficient reason to value. Now suppose the demon will kill\nyou if you value something of value. Here, we might think you lack\nsufficient reason to value the valuable thing. If so, then this\nversion of FA theory also seems subject to counterexample. This class\nof counterexamples is known as the \u201cWrong Kind of Reason\nproblem\u201d since the reasons that figure in the\nexamples\u2014reasons that (dis)favor a valuing attitude without\nmaking the attitude\u2019s object (dis)valuable\u2014are of the\n\u201cwrong kind\u201d to figure in FA theories: they\u2019re\nreasons to value x that are irrelevant to whether x\nhas value, and hence can\u2019t be appealed to in order to explain\nwhy x is (or isn\u2019t) valuable.\n\nThe WKR problem generalizes in two important ways. First, it seems to\narise not only for certain FA theories of value simpliciter,\nbut also for certain FA theories of more specific evaluative\nproperties. For example, Crisp\u2019s demon might equally threaten\nharm unless you admire someone who\u2019s not admirable, despise\nsomeone who\u2019s not despicable, love someone who\u2019s not\nlovable, etc. Second, in addition to arising for versions of FA theory\nthat explain evaluative facts in terms of facts about reasons\nfor certain responses, the WKR problem also arises for FA theories\nthat try to explain evaluative facts by appeal to deontic facts of\nvarious other kinds\u2014for example, by appeal to facts about which\nresponses we ought to or may have. Indeed, just as the demon\u2019s\nthreat might give you a reason to value the mud, it might also make it\nthe case that you should or that you\u2019re\nrequired to value it, or that valuing it would be\njustified. The question of whether the WKR problem\ngeneralizes to apply to all versions of FA theory is discussed in\ndetail below.\n\nAs is always the case when a theory is confronted with putative\ncounterexamples, two broad responses are available: proponents of the\ntheory might either reject the counterexamples or concede them, but\ntry somehow to revise the theory so as to avoid them. Proponents of FA\ntheory have explored both kinds of\n response.[5]\n The first kind of response amounts to skepticism about wrong-kind\nreasons, the view that such \u201creasons\u201d aren\u2019t really\nreasons at all and hence aren\u2019t counterexamples to FA theory. On\nthis view, the demon\u2019s threat doesn\u2019t give you a reason to\nvalue the mud (or make it the case that you should or may value it);\ninstead, it at best gives you a reason to want to value the\nmud, or to bring it about that you do if you can. Thus, FA theories\nthat explain facts about value by appeal to facts about reasons (or\noughts, permissions, etc.) don\u2019t falsely predict, e.g., that the\nmud has value. Hence, for WKR skeptics, putative WKRs pose no problem\nfor FA theories (Parfit 2011; Skorupski 2010; Way 2012).\n\nThe success of this response is a matter of debate. According to many,\nthe claim that WKRs for attitudes aren\u2019t reasons for those\nattitudes seems implausible on substantive, first-order grounds. After\nall, the fact that the demon will kill you unless you value the mud\ndoes seem to speak in favor of valuing it, and it also seems this fact\ncould contribute to making it the case that you ought to value the\nmud, or that you\u2019d be justified in valuing it. And, for various\nreasons, many have found unsatisfying the skeptic\u2019s attempt to\nsave the phenomenon by claiming that, although the demon\u2019s\nthreat gives you no reason to value the mud, it does give you a reason\nto want or to try to bring it about that you do (see, e.g.,\nD\u2019Arms and Jacobson 2000b, Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 2004, Danielsson and Olson 2007, Reisner 2009,\nand Rosen 2015a).\n\nWKR skeptics thus need to argue that WKRs aren\u2019t reasons for the\nattitudes they seem to favor and to explain why they\u2019re not\n(McHugh and Way 2016). One popular proposed explanation of why WKRs\naren\u2019t reasons appeals to a response-condition on reasons,\naccording to which a consideration p can be a reason for you\nto A only if you could A for the reason that\np (Kelly 2002; Shah 2006; Parfit 2011). However, proponents\nof FA theories that explain facts about value in terms of facts about\nreasons seem committed to there being reasons that violate such a\ncondition (Way 2012). To adapt a case from Schroeder (2007a), suppose\nNate loves successful surprise parties thrown in his honor but hates\nunsuccessful ones. Plausibly, if there\u2019s a surprise party for\nNate next door, then there\u2019s value in his going and hence, on a\nreasons-based FA theory, a reason for him to want to go. However,\nsince Nate hates surprise parties he expects, this isn\u2019t a\nreason for which he could want to go: \u201cfor as soon as you tell\nhim about it, [the reason] will go away\u201d (Schroeder 2007a, 165).\nHence, reasons-based FA theories seem committed to there being reasons\nthat violate a response condition. Thus, an appeal to this condition\nto explain why WKRs aren\u2019t reasons looks untenable as part of a\nreply to the WKR problem as it applies to these theories.\n\nThe second strategy for responding to the WKR problem, in contrast,\naccepts that WKRs are reasons. Proponents of this second strategy\nconcede the counterexamples that constitute the WKR problem and try to\nrevise FA theories in light of them. The idea is to distinguish\nbetween the \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d kinds of\nreasons to figure in FA theories, and to reformulate the theories such\nthat they reference only reasons of the \u201cright\u201d kind. The\ndistinction between right-kind reasons (RKRs) and WKRs for valuing\nattitudes can of course be easily drawn by appeal to the property of\nbeing valuable simpliciter: RKRs to value x are\nreasons to value x that also make x somehow\nvaluable, whereas WKRs to value x are reasons to value\nx that don\u2019t also make x valuable. Likewise,\nRKRs to admire x are reasons to admire x that also\nmake x admirable, RKRs to despise x are reasons to\ndespise x that also make x despicable, etc. But such\naccounts of the RKR/WKR distinction are of course unavailable to FA\ntheorists, at least insofar as they aspire to provide non-circular\naccounts of evaluative properties.\n\nOver the last two decades, many have attempted to draw the RKR/WKR\ndistinction in a way that doesn\u2019t render FA theories circular.\nAn early proposal held that RKRs are given by facts about the objects\nof the attitudes they favor, whereas WKRs are given by facts about the\nfavored mental states themselves (Stratton-Lake 2005; Piller 2006;\nParfit 2011). But the object-/state-given theory is extensionally\ninadequate: some WKRs are object-given (Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 2004) and some RKRs may be state-given\n(Schroeder 2012). For example, if a demon will kill me unless I admire\nhim, this looks like a reason to admire the demon that\u2019s given\nby the object of this attitude, but it\u2019s irrelevant to whether\nthe demon is admirable, and hence a WKR. On the flip side, the fact\nthat I\u2019ll soon get more information relevant to deciding whether\nto \u03c6 might be an RKR to hold off intending to \u03c6, despite its\nconcerning not the object of intention, and whether it\u2019s\nworthwhile, but the state of intending itself.\n\nAnother view\u2014the \u201calethic view\u201d\u2014holds that\nright- but not wrong-kind reasons to A are reasons to\nA that bear on whether A accurately represents its\nobject (Tappolet 2011; Rosen 2015). But this proposal also faces\nsignificant difficulties. First, it seems to require taking on\ncontentious commitments about how various types of attitudes represent\ntheir objects in order to guarantee the account\u2019s extensional\ncorrectness (McHugh and Way 2016; Schroeder 2010); and second, these\ncommitments may render FA theories circular, if it\u2019s held that\ncertain of these attitudes represent their objects as having\nevaluative properties (Ross 1939). For example, if we assume that\ndesire represents its object as desirable, then the alethic view would\nyield the plausible result that RKRs for desire are reasons for desire\nrelevant to whether the object of desire is desirable. But (1) this\nview about the representational content of desire is contentious, and\n(2) this commitment would seem to render an FA theory of desirability\n circular.[6]\n\n\nIn addition to these, many other accounts of the RKR/WKR distinction\nhave been offered and criticized (see, e.g., the proposals in\nSchroeder 2010 and Rowland 2019 and the criticisms of each,\nrespectively, in Sharadin 2013 and McHugh and Way 2022a). Common to\nmany proposed ways of drawing the RKR/WKR distinction is a commitment\nto the idea that the distinction can be drawn in terms of reasons and\ncertain non-normative properties alone. This commitment is common, for\ninstance, to all of the proposals mentioned so far. But none of these\nproposals has gained wide acceptance. Partly in light of this, a\nnumber of authors have opted to avoid this commitment, and instead to\noffer an account of the RKR/WKR distinction that takes FA theories\nback to their earliest roots. On this approach, the RKR/WKR\ndistinction can be drawn in terms of the normative notion of\nfittingness. Roughly, RKRs for attitudes are considerations that\ncontribute to the fittingness of those attitudes, whereas WKRs for\nattitudes are reasons for attitudes that lack this feature. On this\nproposal, an FA theory of value simpliciter amounts to the\nthesis that facts involving value simpliciter are always\nfully and ultimately grounded in facts about the fittingness\nof certain valuing responses, rather than in facts about\nreasons for those responses.\n\nProponents of this position argue that the WKR problem poses no\nproblem for FA theories of value so understood (Danielsson and Olson\n2007; Chappell 2012; Sharadin 2015; McHugh and Way 2016; Howard 2019).\nThey claim that while facts like the demon\u2019s threat may provide\nreasons for the attitudes they support, or even make it the case that\nyou ought to have those attitudes, such facts are irrelevant to\nwhether those attitudes are fitting. For example, even if the fact of\nthe demon\u2019s threat gives you a reason to value a cup of mud, or\nmakes it the case that you ought to have this attitude, this fact\nisn\u2019t one in virtue of which the mud merits being\nvalued, or is worthy of this attitude; hence, this fact fails to make\nthe attitude fitting (see the characterization of fittingness, in\nterms of merit and worthiness, offered in section 1.3). The judgment\nthat WKRs such as the demon\u2019s threat are irrelevant to the\nfittingness of the attitudes they favor is widely shared. In addition\nto the authors cited above, see, inter alia, Broad 1930;\nBrandt 1946; Ewing 1939, 1948; Wiggins 1987; and McDowell 1998. Hence,\nsome have argued, drawing the RKR/WKR distinction in terms of\nfittingness, and so formulating FA theory ultimately in terms of\nfittingness rather than in terms of some (other) deontic notion,\noffers a promising solution to the WKR problem for FA theories of\nvalue \n simpliciter.[7]\n Further, this strategy promises to generalize to address the problem\nas it occurs for FA theories of other, specific evaluative properties\nas well.\n\nAt least on the face of things, then, FA theories that explain\nevaluative facts ultimately in terms of facts about the fittingness of\ncertain types of response seem to have an advantage when it comes to\nanswering the WKR problem. Still, some have raised concerns with the\nproposed appeal to fittingness in addressing this problem. For\nexample, some authors claim to lack a pre-theoretical grip on the\nnotion of fittingness, and thus find explanations of evaluative facts\nin terms of facts involving the fittingness relation uninformative\n(Rabinowicz and R\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 2004). And others have argued,\non various grounds, that facts involving the fittingness of human\nresponses will ultimately need to be explained in terms of reasons (of\na certain kind) for those responses (Schroeder 2010, 2020). A fully\nsatisfying answer to the WKR problem that appeals to the notion of\nfittingness will thus need to address these challenges.\n",
