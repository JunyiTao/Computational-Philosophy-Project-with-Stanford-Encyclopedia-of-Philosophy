    "main_text": "Objections to Fictionalism and Responses || Revolutionism and Hermeneuticism\n2.3 Revolutionism and Hermeneuticism\n\nAnother objection to fictionalism is put forward by Burgess\n(2004)\u2014and it should be noted that the argument here has roots\nin Burgess (1983) and Burgess and Rosen (1997). The argument can be\nput like this:\n\nFictionalists face a dilemma: they have to endorse either hermeneutic\nfictionalism or revolutionary fictionalism, but neither is plausible.\nWe can define hermeneutic fictionalism as the view that mathematicians\n(and perhaps ordinary folk) intend their mathematical talk to be taken\nas a form of fiction; more specifically, the view here is that,\naccording to ordinary mathematical intentions, singular terms like\n\u20183\u2019 are not supposed to refer, and sentences like \u20183\nis prime\u2019 are not supposed to be true. But hermeneutic\nfictionalism is implausible and unmotivated; as an empirical\nhypothesis about what mathematicians intend, there is simply no good\nevidence for it, and it seems obviously false. Revolutionary\nfictionalism, on the other hand, is the view that (a) mathematicians\ndo not intend their utterances to be taken as fiction, or as\nnon-literal in any other way; and so (b) we should interpret\nmathematicians as really asserting what their sentences say, i.e., as\nmaking assertions that are about (or that purport to be about)\nmathematical objects; but (c) since there are no such things as\nmathematical objects, the assertions of mathematicians are simply\nuntrue claims. But revolutionary fictionalism is implausible as well;\ngiven the track records of philosophers and mathematicians, it would\nbe \u201ccomically immodest\u201d for philosophers to presume that\nthey had discovered a problem with mathematics (Burgess, 2004, p.\n30).\n\nNo one has ever defended hermeneutic fictionalism, as it\u2019s\ndefined above. Yablo (2002a) claims that his view is a version of\nhermeneutic fictionalism\u2014and Plebani (2018) follows him in this\nway of talking\u2014but the view that these philosophers have in mind\nis a bit different from the hermeneutic fictionalist view described\nabove. Yablo does not claim that mathematicians intend their\nutterances of sentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019 to be taken as\nfictional claims. Rather, he thinks these utterances are (at least\nsometimes, or perhaps typically) analogous to ordinary examples of\nfigurative speech, e.g., sentences like \u2018The back burner is\nwhere you put things to let them simmer.\u2019 This sentence contains\na singular term\u2014\u2018the back burner\u2019\u2014that seems\n(syntactically) to be a denoting expression; but it\u2019s not really\na denoting expression (at least in typical cases) and to interpret it\nas a genuine denoting expression in sentences like the above would be\nto badly misunderstand what typical speakers of sentences like this\nintend to be saying. Yablo thinks that something like this is true in\nconnection with typical utterances of (pure and mixed) mathematical\nsentences, e.g., sentences like \u20183 is prime\u2019 and\n\u2018The number of Martian moons is 2.\u2019 So Yablo is certainly\nproposing a hermeneutic nominalist view, but it\u2019s not\nclear that his view is best thought of as a kind of hermeneutic\nfictionalism. As was noted above (section 2.1), the view\nmight be better classified as a sort of paraphrase nominalism. Yablo\ncalls his view figuralism, and he talks as if it is a version\nof fictionalism. But he seems to be using the term\n\u2018fictionalism\u2019 differently from how it\u2019s been\ndefined here. What he likely has in mind is this: on a\nliteral reading, mathematical sentences are untrue, as\nfictionalism says, but there\u2019s an alternative reading on which\nthey come out true (and nominalistically kosher). But what makes it\nawkward to take Yablo\u2019s view as a version of fictionalism is\nthat he seems to think that what (pure and mixed) mathematical\nsentences really say\u2014or, more precisely, what typical\nutterances of these sentences really say\u2014is true and\nnominalistic in content. This sounds more like paraphrase nominalism\nthan fictionalism.\n\nStanley (2001) has mounted several arguments against hermeneutic\nfictionalism. Responses to his arguments are given by Yablo (2002a)\nand Liggins (2010). \n\nIn contrast to Yablo, Leng (2005a, 2010), Daly (2006), and Balaguer\n(2009) respond to Burgess\u2019s argument by defending revolutionary\nfictionalism. Leng\u2019s version of the response is based on the\nclaim that it is acceptable for philosophers to evaluate and criticize\nthe work of mathematicians. Of course, Leng acknowledges that\nmathematics is a very successful practice and that philosophers have\nto respect this, but her claim is that we can account for the success\nof mathematics without supposing that it\u2019s true. And\ngiven this, she argues, we can rationally evaluate and criticize\nmathematical practice from the outside, from a philosophical point of\nview.\n\nBut there\u2019s another kind of revolutionary fictionalism that\ndoesn\u2019t involve any sort of criticism of mathematics.\nAs it\u2019s formulated above, revolutionary fictionalism is simply\nthe view that (i) we should interpret mathematicians as\nasserting what their sentences say, so that (ii) their\nutterances are untrue claims about abstract objects. But it\ndoesn\u2019t follow from this that there\u2019s something\nwrong with mathematics\u2014something worthy of criticism.\nThis suggests that \u2018revolutionary fictionalism\u2019\nisn\u2019t a very good name for the view. \u2018Assertional\nfictionalism\u2019 would be a better name. If we spoke this way, then\nwe could say that there are both revolutionary and non-revolutionary\nkinds of assertional fictionalism. Revolutionary assertional\nfictionalists would say that we should change what we\u2019re doing\nin mathematics so that we\u2019re no longer making untrue claims;\ne.g., we should start intending our mathematical claims to be taken as\nfictions, or we should start using our mathematical sentences to mean\nwhat if-thenists think they mean, or some such thing.\nNon-revolutionary assertional fictionalists, on the other hand, would\nsay that there\u2019s nothing wrong with mathematics, as it\u2019s\ncurrently practiced; they would admit that mathematical sentences like\n\u20184 is even\u2019 aren\u2019t true; but they would maintain\nthat there\u2019s nothing wrong with this because the mark of\ngoodness in mathematics isn\u2019t truth\u2014it\u2019s truth in\nthe story of mathematics, or some such thing. \n\nField seems to endorse some view in the neighborhood of this sort of\nnon-revolutionism. In discussing Burgess\u2019s argument in the\npreface to the second edition of Science Without Numbers, he\nsays this: \u201cIn my view, this is a false dichotomy. I certainly\ndidn\u2019t think that the account I was providing was\n\u2018hermeneutic,\u2019 but it wasn\u2019t\n\u2018revolutionary\u2019 either: I took what I was doing, rather,\nas providing an account that explains why ordinary mathematical\npractice is perfectly fine.\u201d (Field, 2016, p. 4.)\n\nFinally, Balaguer (2009) argues that there are ways for fictionalists\nto avoid both hermeneuticism and assertionalism and, hence, that they\nmight be able to avoid Burgess\u2019s dilemma altogether. Moreover,\nField (2016) seems to endorse a view like this as well. But\nArmour-Garb (2011) has argued that the version of (non-hermeneuticist,\nnon-assertional) fictionalism that Balaguer proposes here is\nuntenable. \n",
