    "main_text": "Epistemology || Disagreement\n4.2 Disagreement\n\n\nAnti-expertise highlights the limits of what attitudes we can take\n to our own epistemic states and faculties.\n Disagreement\n raises similar issues in a social context by considering how one should\nrespond to disagreement with others who have similar evidence and\nfaculties as you. For conciliation views, the disagreement itself is a\ntype of higher-order evidence that warrants you to be less confident in\nyour own position (see Christensen 2010). For steadfast views, such\ndisagreement should not alter your confidence in your own view (see\nKelly 2005 and 2010).\n\n\nLike modesty, the epistemology of disagreement in part turns on\nwhether or not we have a special relationship with our own states aside\nfrom more general agent-neutral considerations (see Christensen 2007,\n335ff.). This affects how we should relate to our own beliefs and how\nto respond when such beliefs conflict with those of others. This is\nrelevant to responding to rival philosophical views; see Barnett\n(forthcoming).\n",
