    "main_text": "The Foundation and Anti-Foundation Axioms || The Foundation Axiom\n2.2 The Foundation Axiom\n\nThe Foundation Axiom (FA)\nmay be stated in different ways. \n   Here are some formulations;\ntheir equivalence in the presence of the other axioms\n is a standard result of elementary set theory.\n\n\n There are no infinite sequences of sets\n\nx0 \u2009\u220b\u2009 \n  x1   \u2009\u220b\u2009 \n   x2   \u2009\u220b\u2009 \n    \u2026\n    xn \u2009\u220b\u2009 \n     xn+1   \u2009\u220b\u2009 \n \u2026\n \n\n\neach of whose terms is an element of the previous term.\n\nFor every non-empty set x, there is some\ny \u2208 x such that y\u2229x\n=\u2205. \nLet a be any set, and let \nf\u2009:\u2009\u2118a \u2192 a.\nLet b be any transitive set.  Then there is a unique function\ng\u2009:\u2009b \u2192 a so that for\nall x \u2208 b,\ng(x) = f(g[x]).\n\nFor every set x, there is an ordinal number \u03b1  such that \nx \u2208 V\u03b1.\nV = WF.\n\n\nThe first of these is probably the easiest to remember and think about.\nThe second is important because it is the one most easily expressed in first-order\nlogic.   The third is a recursion principle; we shall consider a closely related \nprinciple in\nSection 4.4.\n\n\n2.2.1 The iterative conception of set\n\nAs we have seen, one formulation of FA says that every set belongs\nto some V\u03b1.  This is a mathematical formulation of the\niterative concept of set: sets are just what one gets by\niterating the power set operation on the well-ordered class of ordinal\nnumbers.  We start with nothing, the empty set.[7]\nThis is V0.  Then we form \nV1 = \n\u2118V0.\n  Then \nV2 = \n\u2118V1.\nGoing on, when we come to the first limit ordinal \u03c9, we take \nV\u03c9\nto be \nthe union of all the sets\nVn.  \n  Then we proceed to\nV\u03c9+ 1\n = \u2118 V\u03c9.\n  We continue like this absolutely\nforever, going through \u201call the ordinal numbers\u201d.  The collection so\ndescribed is the universe V of sets.\n\n\nThis way of describing the iterative picture suggests that the ordinal numbers\nwere somehow present  \u201cbefore\u201d all the iteration takes place, or at least\nthat they have a life apart from the rest of the sets.   There is a different way\nof understanding the iterative conception, one that emphasizes the \nharmony between the iteration of the power set operation and the Replacement Axiom:\nas one iterates the power set axiom, more and more well-ordered sets appear.\nReplacement allows us to decorate these well-ordered sets, creating new ordinals\nin the process.  Thus the whole picture is one of balance.\nIndeed, this point about balance can be phrased without reference to any\n\u201citeration\u201d at all: there is an equilibrium in the set theoretic universe\nbetween the \u201csideways\u201d push of the Power Set Axiom and the \n\u201cupward\u201d push of the Replacement\nAxiom.[8]\n\n\nUsing the Foundation Axiom.\nFA plays no role in the formalization of mathematics or in the study of infinity.\nIt is an \u201coptional extra\u201d  for mathematics.   FA is used\nto clarify our picture of sets, just as we have described.  This often comes \nwith an implicit argument of roughly the following shape:\n\n\nAn argument.\nOne is tempted to justify FA along the following lines:\n\n\nRussell\u2019s Paradox shows that there is no set of all sets:\nthe class V cannot be a member of itself.\n\nThe iterative picture shows why no set can be a\nmember of itself.\n\nThe iterative picture also suggests FA in the form that every\nset belongs to some V\u03b1.\n\nThus FA reflects a picture which avoids Russell\u2019s Paradox,\nhence it is sensible to accept it.\n\n\n\nThe rejoinder here is that there might be other intuitive pictures\nor conceptions of sets\n that also explain, or draw lessons from, the paradoxes.   So they \n would be as sensible as FA in this regard.\n \n\n Since FA plays a conceptual role but no mathematical role,\n it is not surprising that there are widely different views on \n whether it is an important part of standard set theory ZFC or not.\n For a collection of quotes on the role of FA, see\n Barwise and Moss (1991).\n\n\nThe Foundation Axiom and object circularity.\nWe mentioned in connection with streams that according to standard set theory,\nstreams of numbers do not exist.   Here is the reasoning.\nRecall that we defined a stream to be a pair of a number and another stream.\n  Suppose that a stream\ns exists, so that the set N\u221e\nof streams is non-empty.\n  Recall that we have a function  \nfs\u2009:\u2009N \u2192 N\u221e \n by recursion:\n \n\n\n\nfs(0)\n=\ns\n\n\nfs(n+1)\n=\ntail(fs(n))\n\n\n\n\nTo save on some notation at this point, let\u2019s write hn for \nhead(fs(n))\nand \ntn\nfor\ntail(fs(n)).\nFor all n,\n\n\n\nfs(n)  = \n\u27e8\u2009hn, tn\u2009\u27e9 \n = \n {{hn},  {{hn, tn}}}; \n\n\n\nthis is true of any pair whatsoever.\nNotice that \n\n\n\nfs(n+1) \n=  tn\n\u2208\n{hn, tn}\n\u2208\nfs(n).\n\n\n\nSo we have\n\n\n\nfs(0)\n\u220b\n{h0, t0}\n\u220b\nfs(1)\n\u220b\n{h1, t1}\n\u220b\nfs(2)\n\u220b\n\u2026\n\n\n\nThis is a descending sequence in the membership relation, something forbidden by FA.\n\n\nThe same kind of remark applies to infinite trees as we discussed them,\nand certainly to hypersets.    The conclusion is that if one wants to work with such objects\nin a set theory with FA, then one must do so indirectly.    \n\n2.3 The Anti-Foundation Axiom\n\nThe Anti-Foundation Axiom AFA is stated as follows:\n\n\n Every graph has a unique decoration.\n\n\nThe theory ZFA is ZFC with FA  replaced by AFA.\nIt includes the Axiom of Choice, even though there is no \u201cC\u201d in the \nacronym.\n\n\nThe coiterative conception of set.\nAFA gives rise to, or reflects, a conception of set that is at odds\nwith the iterative conception.   For lack of a better name, we call it\nthe coiterative conception.    According to this, a set is an abstract\nstructure obtained by taking a graph G \n(a set with a relation  on it),\nand then associating to each node x in the graph a set in such a way that\nthe set associated to x is the set of sets associated to the children of x\nin G .    This association is what we called decoration earlier.\n This association might be thought of procedurally, but it need not be\nso construed.   One can instead posit a harmony between decoration\nand power sets.[9]\n\nWhat changes with AFA, and what does not change?.  \n AFA gives us unique solutions to systems of set systems;\nthis is almost immediate from the axiom and the close relation of set systems\nand graphs.    But it also gives us unique solutions for stream systems and tree systems.\nThe details of this are suggested by our work on the decoration of \n the graph related to streams and pairs which we saw\nearlier on.\n\n\nAll of the results in set theory which\ndo not use FA go through when one replaces it by AFA.  In particular, \nthe following topics are unchanged: Russell\u2019s Paradox  and the Separation\n(Subset) Axioms;\nthe modeling of ordered pairs, relations and functions; \nthe natural numbers, real numbers, etc.;  well-orderings and the ordinal numbers;\ntransfinite recursion on well-orders and well-founded relations;\nthe Axiom of Choice; problems and results concerning the sizes of infinite sets.\nThe only difference would be in modeling questions for circularly defined objects of various\nsorts,\nas we have been discussing\nthem.    \n\n\nIn terms of modeling circularity, AFA gives several new concepts\nand techniques.   These are described in our next section.\n\n3. Using AFA\n\nThis section offers\na quick introduction to the central parts of the theory\nnon-wellfounded sets: what one would need to know to use\nthe theory and to read papers on it.\n\n3.1 Bisimulation\n\nThe topic of bisimulation is one of the earliest goals in a\ntreatment of non-wellfounded sets.\n\n\n Let (G,\u2192) be a graph.\n A relation R on\nG is a bisimulation if the following holds:\nwhenever x\u2009R\u2009y, \n\n\nIf x \u2192 x\u2032, then there is some \ny \u2192 y\u2032\nsuch that  x\u2032\u2009R\u2009y\u2032.\n\n\n If  y \u2192 y\u2032, \n then there is some x \u2192 x\u2032\n such that  x\u2032\u2009R\u2009y\u2032.\n\n\n\nThese are sometimes called by the suggestive names\nzig and zag.\n\n\nBisimulation between graphs.\nBefore giving examples, we should clarify some usage.\nAt a few points, we\u2019ll speak of bisimulation between two graphs\nG and H, rather than on a single graph.\n   This can be defined in the same general way.    Note also that one can\n   take the disjoint union G + H\n    of the graphs G and H, and then \n   a bisimulation between G and H would be a \nbisimulation on G + H.\n\n\nReturning to bisimulation on a graph.\n For an example, let\u2019s look at the following graph G:\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of the  3-points have no children. \n(Point 3d is not reached from any other point, but\nthe arrows into a node are of no interest.)\n   So every relation which\nonly relates 3-points is a bisimulation  on G.\nConcretely, \n\n\n{(3a, 3b), (3c, 3a), (3d, 3d)}\n\n\nis easily seen to be a bisimulation.\n\n\nFor that matter, the empty relation is also a bisimulation on G.\n\n\nAnother bisimulation is\n\n{(2a, 2b), \n(2b, 2c), (2c, 2a),\n (3a, 3b), \n (3b, 3c), (3c, 3a)}. \n\n\nLet\u2019s call this relation R.\nIt would take a lot of checking to actually verify\nthat R is a bisimulation.\nHere is just two items of it:  We see that  2b\u2009R\u20092c.\nNow  2c \u2192 2b.  \nThus we need some node\nx so that x\u2009R\u20092b\n and  2b \u2192 x.\nFor this, we take  2a.     For our second point \nof verification, again note that \n 2b\u2009R\u2009 2c .   Since \n 2b \u2192  3b, we need some\n node x so that  2c \u2192 x and  3b\n \u2009R\u2009\n x.\n We take \n x = 3c for this.\n\n\n The largest bisimulation on our graph G is the \n relation that relates\n1\n  to itself, all 2-points to\n all 2-points, and all 3-points\n  to all 3-points.\n Note that this is an equivalence relation:\n reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.\n This is not an accident.\n\n\nProposition  For any graph H, there is a largest\n bisimulation on   H.    This relation is\n an equivalence relation denoted  \u2261b, \n  and it is  characterized by\n\nx  \u2261b\ny \niff  there is a bisimulation on\n H \n  relating x to y.\n\n\n This relation   \u2261b  is\ncalled  bisimilarity.\n\n\nWe can always form the quotient graph \n using the largest bisimulation.\nHere is how this works, using G\n from above\nas an example.    In  G/\u2261b,\nwe would have three nodes, corresponding to the\nthree  equivalence classes under the largest bisimulation;\n let\u2019s call these  classes \n 1, 2 and 3.   We put an arrow between\n two of these  classes if some (every) element of the first has an\n arrow to some element of the second.    In this way, we \n construct the quotient.  \n Here is a picture of  G\n again, along with its \n quotient  G/\u2261b\nunder the largest bisimulation:\n\n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \n\n\nThe map from G\n to   G/\u2261b\n takes the 2-points to  the point 2,\nand the 3-points to the point 3.\n\n\nUp until now, we have said what bisimulation is, but we did not describe \nits relation to anything else.    To rectify matters, here is the main result.\n\n\n Theorem\nAssume AFA.   Let G be a graph, let x and y \nbe nodes of G, and let d be the decoration of G.\nThen the following are equivalent:\n\n\n d(x) = d(y).\n\n There is a bisimulation relating x and y.\n\n\n\n\nWe are not going to prove this theorem in full here, but instead here\nare two hints.   To prove that (1) implies (2), check that \nthe kernel relation of d, \n\n\n{(u, v) : d(u) = d(v)}\n\n\nis a bisimulation on G.\n\n\nIn the other direction, the idea is to turn a bisimulation into a graph\nitself, and then extract two decorations of it; by the uniqueness part\nof AFA these must coincide.\nHere is how this is done in a concrete example.  \nWe saw above that \n\n\nR \u2009=\u2009 \n {(2a, 2b), (2b, 2c), (2c, 2a),\n(3a, 3b), (3b, 3c), \n(3c, 3a)}. \n\n\nis a bisimulation.   \nWe make it into a graph by taking the product relation.\nThis gives the following graph which we call H:\n\n\n\n\n\nLet d be a decoration (no, the decoration)\n of G.\nWe get two decorations of H,  k and l defined by\n\n\nk(u, v) = d(u), \nand  l(u, v) = d(v).\n \n\n (It is good to check that these really are decorations of H.)\n But H can have only one decoration.    So k = b.\n And then, corresponding to the fact that  \n  2a\u2009R\u20092c,\n  for example, \n we have\n\n\nd(2a) = k(2a,2b) \n=  l(2a,2b)\n=\n  d(2b).\n \n\n This concludes our sketch.  For more details, see Aczel (1988).\n\n3.2 Doing without AFA\n\nOur work on bisimulation above can be used to effect a \nreduction of the of non-wellfounded sets to that of ordinary sets,\nmuch in the spirit of what we saw for streams and functions in\nSection 1.1.\n    There are several ways to \ndescribe such a reduction.   \n\n\nA pointed graph is a triple  (G,\u2192, g) \n such that  \u2192  is \na relation on G\n and g\u2009\u2208\u2009 G.\n   A bisimulation\n between pointed graphs  (G,\u2192, g)  and \n  (H,\u21d2, h)  \nis a bisimulation  R\n between  (G,\u2192)  and \n (H,\u21d2)   such that\ng \u2009 R \u2009 h.  \n\n\nIn the remainder of this discussion, we let \np, q,  \u2026  denote \npointed graphs.    We write   p \u2261b\nq\n if there is a bisimulation\nbetween p and q.   We write \np \u03b5\nq\n if\nthere is a pointed graph  (G,\u2192, g)\n and some g \u2192 h\nin G\n so that\n\n\n\np \u2261\n (G,\u2192, h)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and\u00a0\u00a0\nq  \u2261\n (G,\u2192, g).\n\n\n\nSentences in the language of set theory talk about sets, and\nwe translate them to sentences about pointed graphs by \nrestricting all quantifiers to the class of pointed graphs, and then\ntranslating \u2208 to \u03b5, and \u2261 for  =.  For\nexample, the Axiom of Extensionality\n\n\n\u2200x,y(x=y \u2192 \n \u2200z(z \u2208 x \u2192\n z \u2208 y)).\n\n\n\nwould translate to (where p, q, r range over\npointed graphs):\n\n\n\n\u2200p,q(p \u2261 q \u2192\n \u2200r(r \u03b5 p \u2192\n r \u03b5 q)).\n\n\n\nThis last sentence is then provable.  (Hint: the union of any set\nof bisimulations on a graph is again a bisimulation on it.)\n\n\nIndeed, all of the axioms of ZFA are provable, including AFA.\nThis is a fairly long and tedious verification, but it is not so tricky.    \n  A version of it\n(for set theory with urelements, objects which are not sets)\nis the topic of a chapter in Barwise and Moss (1996).\n\n\nOne can also go further: instead of translating the identity relation\n =  into something more complex, we may keep the language simple\nand complicate the interpretation.   We would like to replace \u201cpointed graph\u201d\nby \u201c\u2261-class of pointed graph\u201d. Since these are not sets, we instead\nemploy Scott\u2019s trick and instead use \u201cset of \nwell-founded pointed graphs whose node sets are \n\u2261-equivalent\nand with the property that no pointed graph of smaller rank is \nalso  \u2261-equivalent to them.\u201d\n\n\nDoing all of this leads to relative consistency result:\n\n\nTheorem.\nIf   ZFC is consistent, then so is   ZFA,\nand vice-versa.\n\n3.3 Extended graphs\n\nThe way we have presented graphs, decorations, and AFA is a \nvery \u201cminimalist\u201d presentation.  \n If one would like some node of a graph G\nto be decorated by some set  a\n the most obvious way would be to\nadd all the elements of tc({x})\n as fresh nodes in G, with\ny\u2192 z  iff z \u2208 y.   \nThis means that one must take new copies\nif some of the sets in tc({x})\n already happen to be nodes in G.\nThis is often cumbersome:\nwhen working with graphs and decorations, one might well want to \npre-specify as much as possible the value of the decoration on\na node.    There are several ways to do this with AFA, and we\u2019ll indicate\none here.\n\n\nTwo sets are disjoint if their intersection is\nempty.    When one takes the union of two sets,\nsay a and b,  it is sometimes\na good idea to make sure that no element occurs\nin both sets.   The way to do this is to replace one or both\nof  a and b by copies.\n\n\nThe disjoint union of sets  a and b \n is  a+ b,  defined by\n\n\na+b  =  (a \u2009\u00d7 {0})\n \u222a  (b \u2009 \u00d7 {1}).\n\n\nIt is easy to see that the two sets in the union are disjoint:\nthe elements of  a+ b\n \u201cwear on their sleeve\u201d a mark of which\nset they come from.\n\n\nThe disjoint union comes with two natural functions:\n\n\ninl\n:  a \u2192 a+ b\n\u00a0 and\u00a0\u00a0\ninr\n: b \u2192 a+ b\n\n\ndefined by inl(x) = \n\u27e8x,0\u27e9 \n and  inr(x) = \n\u27e8x,1\u27e9  .\n[10]\n\nA graph extended with set parameters  (or extended graph for short)\nis a set G\n together with a function \n e: G\u2192 \n     \u2118G+V.\n If  e(g) \n  is of the form  \n\u27e8s,0\u27e9 \n for some s \u2286 G, then \nwe intend it as a node just as in our earlier treatment. \n  In particular, we want to decorate\nit with the set of decorations of its children.   If  e(g) = \n\u27e8x,1\u27e9 ,\n then\nwe want a decoration to be forced to have the value x on g.  \n\n\nFormally, a decoration of an extended graph is a function d defined on G\nso that for all g \u2208 G,\n\n\n\n\nd(g)\n = \n{\n\n{d(h) :  g \u2192 h}\n \nx\n\nif e(g) = \n\u27e8s,0\u27e9 \n\n  if  e(g) = \n\u27e8x,1\u27e9 \n \n\n\n\n\nHere is an example: \nLet G be the extended graph with node set \n{w, x, y, z}\nand with e given by\n\n\n\n\ne(w) = \n\n\u27e8{w, x, y}, 0\u27e9 \n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\ne(y)  = \n \n\u27e82,1\u27e9   \n\n\n\n\ne(x)  = \n \n\n\u27e8{z}, 0\u27e9 \n \n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\ne(z)   =\n    \n\u27e8\u2205,0\u27e9 \n\n\n\n\n\nThen a decoration d of this extended graph\n would satisfy the following conditions:\n \n\n\n\n\nd(w) = \n{d(w),1,2} \n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nd(y)  = 2\n\n\n\n\nd(x)  = {0} = 1\n  \n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nd(z)   =\n\u2205  = 0\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem\nAssume AFA.    \n Then every extended graph has a unique decoration.\n\n\nThe point we are trying to make is that there is quite a bit of theory\naround to facilitate working in ZFA in order to do modeling of\nvarious forms of circular phenomena.\n\n3.4 Collection circularity in ZFA\n\n The fact that AFA allows us to solve various kinds of\nsystems of set equations is only the beginning.  When we discussed\ninfinite trees in\n Section 1.2,\n we noted that the collection Tr of infinite trees\nshould satisfy (7), repeated below: \n\nTr\u00a0\u00a0 =\u00a0\u00a0\n {x, y} \u222a ({\u2022} \u00d7 Tr) \u222a\n  ({*} \u00d7 Tr \u00d7 Tr).\n \n\nA similar equation should hold of streams from \nSection 1.1:\n\n\nN\u221e\u00a0\u00a0 =\u00a0\u00a0  N \u00d7\nN\u221e .\n \n\nFor that matter,  the universe V\nof sets should satisfy\n \n\nV\u00a0\u00a0 =\u00a0\u00a0\u2118V\n\n\nAssuming the Power Set Axiom and the formulation of \n\u2118 as an operator\non classes, the universe \nV does satisfy this equation.\n\n\nWe are free to step back and think of these as equations which\nwe hope to solve.   For example, we could take the set N as known,\nregard N\u221e as a variable, and then consider an equation like\nX = N\u00d7X.    \nHowever, the  none of these is the kind of equation that we could hope to\nsolve in a perfectly general way using AFA: the right-hand sides are \nnot given in terms of sets of objects on the left.\nSolving more complicated systems takes special additional  work.\nHere is what is known on this.\n\n\nFirst, under FA,  \nthe first two of our three equations each have a unique\nsolution: the empty set.   Under AFA, they have many solutions.\nFor example, for the stream equation, the set of streams corresponding to\nfunctions which are eventually  0 is a solution.   \nHowever, the largest solutions are of special interest.   \nFor these, one can prove that the largest solutions are in one-to-one correspondence\nwith what we have called the unraveled forms.   And for other reasons which we\nshall see, there is a good reason to accept the claim that the largest solutions\nare good mathematical models of the intuitive concepts. \n\n\nUnder AFA, things are different.   Here is the general picture:\nAn operator on sets F is  monotone if whenever\na \u2286 b,\nthen also Fa \u2286 Fb.\n    This is a very common feature\nfor operators on sets.   The polynomial operators on sets\nare the smallest collection containing the constant operators, \nand closed under cartesian product, disjoint union, and functions from\na fixed set.    For example, if A and B are fixed sets, then \nFs  = (A \u00d7 s)  +\n B(s + A) is a polynomial operator on sets.\nIf one also allows the power set operator to occur, then we\nget the power polynomial operators.   Every power polynomial operator\nis\nmonotone.    And now, we have the following results due to  Aczel:\n\n\n\nProposition. Then \n every monotone operator  F on\nsets has a least fixed point F*   and a\n greatest fixed point  F*.    In particular, \n every polynomial operator on classes has least \n and greatest fixed points.      On classes, the same is true for\n the  larger collection of power polynomial operators.\n \n\n\nAssuming FA, the fixed points are unique; frequently they are the \nempty set.   \nWith AFA, the greatest fixed points usually have non-wellfounded \nmembers.    We shall study this in more detail when we turn to coalgebra.\nFor now,  we return to the last of the example equations\nat the top of this section, \nV\u00a0\u00a0 =\u00a0\u00a0\u2118V.\n This equation has no solutions\nin sets due to \nCantor\u2019s Theorem.\nHowever, in terms of classes, this equation does have solutions, as we\nknow.   The universal class  V\n is a solution, as we have seen.   \nAnd the class WF of well-founded sets is a solution.   This is the \nsmallest solution \u2118*, and \n V  is the largest.    Under FA, \n\u2118*\n = V\n   = \u2118*.   Under AFA, \n \u2118*\n  and \u2118* are\ndifferent: \n\u2118*  = WF, and \n\u2118* =  V\n and thus contains \nsets such as  \u03a9= {\u03a9}.\n\n4. Comparing Foundation and Anti-Foundation\n\nThe purpose of this section is to compare FA and AFA in a \ntechnical way, using ideas from category theory.    That is, the \nlanguage of category theory and especially its \nbuilt-in feature of duality are used to say something insightful\nabout the relation between FA and AFA.    Further, the dual\nstatements about the axioms\n suggest a much more systematic and thoroughgoing \nduality about a host of other concepts.    This deeper point is\nnot a strictly mathematical result but rather more of a research program,\nand so the final subsection here will detail some of what is known\nabout it.\n\n\nAs we said, our work here begins to use category theory.\nWe realize that not all readers will be familiar with that subject\nat all.    \nSo we shall \ntry to make this section as accessible as possible.\nIn particular, we\u2019ll \nonly present those notions from category theory that we actually\nneed in our work of this section.      We also illustrate all of the \ndefinitions on a few categories which will be of interest.  And as we go\non in future sections, we\u2019ll develop only the background that we \nneed.[11]\n\n\nOur use of category theory is mainly for the terminology and intuition.   \nWe know that there are philosophical issues connected with the use\nof category theory as a foundation for mathematics.     This entry does not\ndeal  with any of these issues in a head-on way.\n\n\nInitial and final objects.\n\n\nWe need a definition from category theory.\nFix a category C.\nAn object x  is initial if for every object y\nthere is exactly one morphism \nf\u2009:\u2009x \u2192 y \nDually, an object x  is final if for every object y\nthere is exactly one morphism\nf\u2009:\u2009y \u2192 x.\n\n\nIn  Set, the empty set is an initial object; for every set y,\nthe empty function is the only function from  \u2205 to y.\nIn addition, the empty set is the only initial object.\n\n\nAs for final objects, every singleton {x} is a final object.\nFor every set y, the constant function with value x is the only\nfunction from y  to x.    And the singletons are the only final objects \nin the category.\n\n\nProposition\nLet C be a category, and  a\n and b\nbe initial objects.\nThen a and b are\nisomorphic objects: there are \nmorphisms\nf\u2009:\u2009a \u2192 b \nand \ng\u2009:\u2009b \u2192 a \nand  \n such that\n  g\u22c5f = ida\nand \n f\u22c5g = idb.\n\n\nProof\nBy initiality, we get (unique) morphisms f and g as in our statement.\nNote that\ng\u22c5f is a morphism from\na to itself.   And since \na is initial\nand ida\n is also such a morphism, we see that \n g\u22c5f \n   = ida.\nSimilarly for  b.\n\n4.1 The category of sets, the category of classes\n\nWe refer the reader to the entry on \n  category theory\n for the definitions of category and functor.\n\n\nWe need to mention the objects and morphisms in the categories of sets\nand of classes, and also to spell out the functors of interest on\nthem.\n\n\nSet.\nThe objects are the sets, and the morphisms \n are triples \n\u27e8x, y, f\u27e9,  where\nf\u2009:\u2009x \u2192 y.  That is,\neach triple \u27e8 x, y, f\u27e9 is a\nmorphism from x to y.  The identity\nmorphism ida for a set a is\n\u27e8a, a, f\u27e9 , where f is\nthe identity function on a and the composition operation of\nmorphisms is given by:\n\n\n\n\u27e8y, z, g\u27e9  \u22c5 \n\u27e8x, y, f\u27e9  = \n\u27e8x, z, g \u22c5 f\u27e9 \n\n\n\nFunctors on Set.\nThe polynomial operators on sets extend to\n endofunctors on Set.     The way that these operations are defined\n on morphisms is straightforward and may be found in any book\n on category theory.   Here is a brief summary:\n For any set s, the constant functor with value s is a functor\non Set.  \n It takes every function to  ids.\nFor any two functors F and G,\nwe have a functor  F\u00d7\nG\ndefined by  (F\u00d7\nG)(a) = Fa \u00d7\nGa; here we use the \ncartesian product on sets.   If \nf\u2009:\u2009a \u2192 b, then \n\n\n(F\u00d7\n G)f(a, b)  =\n(Ff(a), Gf(b)).\n\n\nWe also have a functor F+G defined by \n (F + G)(a) = Fa+ Ga\n using the coproduct on sets, that is, the disjoint union.\n Here the action on morphisms is by cases \n \n\n\n  (F + G)(f)\n  (inl x) = Ff(x)\n  \n \n    (F + G)(f)\n  (inr x) = Gf(x)\n  \n\n\nA special case is Fx = x + 1.  That is,  \nFx is the disjoint union of x\nwith a singleton.   And if f\u2009:\u2009x \u2192 y,\n then \n Ff\u2009:\u2009Fx \u2192 Fy\nworks in much the same way, taking the new point in x to the new point in y,\nand otherwise behaving like f.\n\n\nThe power polynomial operators  also extend to endofunctors on Set:\non morphisms\nf\u2009:\u2009x \u2192 y, \nthe function \n\u2118f:\n     \u2118x \u2192 \n     \u2118y\n takes each subset a \u2286\nx\nto its  image \n\n\nf[a]  = {f(z) : z \u2009 \u2208 \u2009\n         a}.\n\n\nClass.\nHere the objects are formulas in the language of set theory\n\u03c6(x, y1,\u2026, yn) together with n sets  a1,\u2026, \n an.\nWe think of this as \n\n\n\n{b : \u03c6[b,  a1,\u2026, \n an]}.\n\n\n\nThe morphisms are then triples consisting of two \nformulas with parameters defining the domain and codomain,\nand a third one with two free parameters defining the action\nof the morphism.\n\n\nFunctors on Class.\nThe functors of interest are again the power polynomials.\nThey are defined on \n Class\n  similarly to the way they are defined on  Set.\nFor our purposes, the main difference between  the two categories\n is that\nin \nSet  we cannot solve  \n\u2118(x) = x, while we can do so in \n Class.\n\n4.2 Algebras  for a functor\n\nLet F be an endofunctor on a category \nC.\n An algebra for\nF is a pair  (c, f),\nwhere  c  is an object of C, and\nf\u2009:\u2009Fc \u2192 c.\n\n\nHere is a basic example that illustrates why these are called \nalgebras.    \nLet\u2019s take the category Set\n of sets, and the functor\n\n Ha  = (a \u00d7 a)   + \n(a \u00d7 a). \n \n\nFor the object N of natural numbers,  HN is thus\ntwo copies of N\u00d7N.\n  We\u2019ll use colors to indicate\nthe different copies, with red for the first copy and blue for\nthe second.  So we can view  HN as\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0,0)\n(0,1)\n(0,2)\n\u2026\n\n\n(1,0)\n(1,1)\n(1,2)\n\u2026\n\n\n(2,0)\n(2,1)\n(2,2)\n\u2026\n\n\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0,0)\n(0,1)\n(0,2)\n\u2026\n\n\n(1,0)\n(1,1)\n(1,2)\n\u2026\n\n\n(2,0)\n(2,1)\n(2,2)\n\u2026\n\n\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne example of an algebra for this functor\nis  (N, \u03b1), \nwhere\n\u03b1(a, b)\n = a + b and  \n\u03b1(a, b) \n= a \u00d7\nb.  In other words, \u03b1 operates on the red pairs\nby adding and on the blue pairs by multiplying.\n\n\nGetting back to the terminology of \u201calgebra\u201d, the point is that \nthe function \u03b1 does the work of the two tables.   \nThe function \u201cis\u201d the tables.\n\n\nHere is another example of an algebra.  \nThis time we are concerned on  Set  with \nFx = x +1, as defined above.\nThe algebra we have in mind is  (N, s).   Here\ns\u2009:\u2009N+1  \u2192 N \ntakes the  natural number n to its successor n+1,\nand the new point in N+1  to the number 0.\n\n\nUp until now, we have merely given examples of algebras for\ndifferent functors.\nThe advantage of the categorical  formulation is that the usual notions\nof a morphism of algebras turn out to be special case\nof a more general definition.\n\n\nLet  \n (c, f) \n  and \n   (d, g) \nbe algebras for the same functor F on the category C.\nA morphism of algebras from\n (c, f) \nto\n   (d, g) \n    is\na morphism \n\u03b1\u2009:\u2009c \u2192 d\n  so that\nthe diagram below commutes:\n\n\n\n\n\nFc\nf\u2192\nc\n\n\n\nF\u03b1\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\u03b1\n\n\n\nFd\n\u2192g\nd\n\n\n\n\n\n(This means that the two compositions, \n\u03b1 \u22c5 f and \n g\u22c5F\u03b1,\n are the same function.)\n\n\nIt now is clear that we have a category of algebras for a given functor.\nAnd so we  immediately have the concept of initial and final\nalgebras.   There is no guarantee that these exist, but in many interesting cases \nthey do.    The reason we are interested in initial algebras is their connection to\nrecursion.     \n\n\nTo see this in detail, we return to the functor \nFx = x + 1\n on Set.\nWe saw the algebra  (N, s) \n above.    We claim that this is an initial algebra.\nWhat this means is that for any algebra  \n (A, a), there is a unique algebra morphism\n h\u2009:\u2009 (N, s)  \u2192  (N, s).\n   That is, the diagram below commutes:\n\n\n\n\n\nN+1\ns\u2192\nN\n\n\n\nh+1\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\nh\n\n\n\nA+1\n\u2192a\nA\n\n\n\n\n\nThue function a from A+1 to A may be decomposed into \na map \n i\u2009:\u2009A \u2192 A \ntogether with\nan element b \u2208 a.\n  And to say that the diagram above commutes\nis the same thing as saying that \n h(0) =  b, and for all n \u2208 N,\n h(s(n)) =  a(h(n)).\n\n\nStepping back, the purported initiality of  (N, s) is the same as the following assertion:\n\n\nFor every set A, every b\u2009\u2208\u2009A,\n and every \n a\u2009:\u2009A \u2192 A,\n there is a unique\nfunction h\u2009:\u2009N \u2192 A \n such that \nh(0) = b, \nand for all \nn\u2009\u2208\u2009N,\n  h(s(n)) = a(h(n)).\n\n\n This is the standard form of the Principle of Recursion on N.\nThe upshot is that this principle is equivalent to the assertion that \n (N, s)  is an\ninitial algebra of the functor Fx = x +1.     \n\n\nOne way to interpret this equivalence is that we can take the existence\nof an initial algebra for \nFx  = \nx+ 1\n as an axiom of set theory,\nin place of the usual Axiom of Infinity.   That axiom says that there is\nan algebra for the singleton functor \nSx = {x}\n on sets which contains\n\u2205 as an element and whose structure is the inclusion.\nThis principle is easier to state than the algebraic reformulation.\nIt takes a bit of work to use the simpler standard formulation to derive\nthe Recursion Principle, and this is one of the basic topics in any\ncourse on axiomatic set theory.\n\n\nTwo general facts: \nFirst,  the structure map of an initial algebra on  Set  is always \na bijection.  This follows from a very general result in category theory due to J. Lambek.\nAnd from this we see that \u2118\n has no initial algebras on  Set, by \n Cantor\u2019s Theorem.\n\n\nInitial algebras for polynomial functors on  Set.\n\n\nLet F\u2009:\u2009 Set \u2192 Set \n be a power polynomial functor.     We know that F is \nmonotone (it preserves the subset relation on sets), and \nit is not hard to check a slightly stronger property:  F preserves\ninclusion maps between classes:    An inclusion\nis a  map ia, b\u2009:\u2009a \u2192 b \n on classes which \u201cdoesn\u2019t do anything\u201d:\na must be a subset of b,\nand for all x \u2208 a, \ni(x) = x.  \nWe say that F is standard if it preserves inclusions in \nthe sense that \nFia, b  = \niFa, Fb.\nOnce again, every power polynomial endofunctor on \nSet is standard.\n\n\nThe polynomial\noperations on sets (without power)  are also continuous:\nthey preserve countable unions of sets.   \n\n\nLet F\u2009:\u2009 Set \u2192 Set  be a polynomial endofunctor.\nWe sketch the proof that the least fixed point F*\n carries the structure\nof an initial algebra, together with the identity on it.   \n\n\nOne forms the increasing sequence\n\n\n0    \u2286 F0  \u2286 F(F0)  \u2286 \nF(F(F0)) \u2026\n\n\nWe write 0 for \u2205.\nEach of the maps shown is an inclusion, by standardness.\nLet F* be the union of the increasing sequence \nFn0 of sets.\nThen F(F*) = F*\n  by continuity.    So  (F*, id)  is an algebra for F.\nTo check initiality, let \n(A, a)\nbe an algebra for F, \nso\n a\u2009:\u2009Fa \u2192 a.\nDefine maps\n gn\u2009:\u2009Fn(0)\n  \u2192 A \n by recursion, with \n  g0\u2009:\u20090\n  \u2192 A \n the empty function\n(this is what initiality of \u2205 amounts to), and \n  gn+1 = \n  a \u22c5 Fgn.\nCheck that we have an increasing sequence of functions\n\n\ng0 \u2286\ng1 \u2286\ng2 \u2286\n \u2026\n \n\nthen take the union to get  \n\u03c6 \u2009:\u2009 F* \u2192 A.\nOne checks that this \u03c6 is a morphism of F-algebras, and indeed\nis the only such.\n\n4.3 Coalgebras for a functor\n\nWe now turn to coalgebras.\nAgain, let F be an endofunctor on a category C.\nA coalgebra for F is a pair (c, f), where \nc\nis an object of C, and \nf\u2009:\u2009c \u2192 Fc.   Comparing\nthis to the definition of an algebra, we can see that a\ncoalgebra is the same kind of structure, except that the \ndirection of the arrow is reversed.\n\n\nFor example, every graph is a coalgebra of  \u2118  on \nF\u2009:\u2009 Set \u2192 Set.\nThat is, every graph  (G,\u2192)  may be re-packaged \nas  (G, e), with\ne\u2009:\u2009G \u2192\n \u2118 \n G \ngiven by\n e(x) = {y \u2208 G :\n       x\u2192 y}.   In words, we trade in the \nedge relation of a graph with the function that assigns to each\npoint its set of children.    This re-packaging has an inverse,\nand so the notions of \u201cgraph as set with relation\u201d\nand \u201cgraph as coalgebra of \u2118\u201d \nare in this sense\nnotational variants.[12]\n\nLet \n (c, f)\n  and \n   (e, g)\n    be coalgebras for the same functor.\nA morphism of coalgebras from \n (c, f)\n  to \n   (d, g)\n    is\na morphism \n \u03b1\u2009:\u2009c \u2192 d \n  in the category C so that\nthe diagram below commutes:\n\n\n\n\n\nc\nf\u2192\nFc\n\n\n\u03b1\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\u00a0\u00a0F\u03b1\n\n\n\nd\n\u2192g\nFd\n\n\n\n\nA coalgebra (d, g) is a final (or terminal)\ncoalgebra if for every coalgebra  (c, f), there is a \nunique morphism of coalgebras \n\u03b1\u2009:\u2009(c,f) \u2192 (d,g).\n\n\nHere is another example as we wind our way back\nto set theory.\nThese are based on discussions at the beginning of this entry,\nconcerning streams of numbers \n(Section 1.1).\nWe are dealing with the functor Fa = N\u00d7a.   \nThen a \nsystem of stream equations is  a coalgebra for F.\nTo see how this works in a concrete case, we return\nto  equation (2), reiterated below:\n\n\n\n\n(2)\nx \u2248 \n\u27e80,\u2009y\u27e9 \n\n\n\ny  \u2248  \n\u27e81,\u2009z\u27e9 \n\n\n\nz  \u2248  \n\u27e82,\u2009x\u27e9 \n\n\n\n\nWe regard  this system as a coalgebra (X, e), where \nX = {x, y, z},\ne(x) = \n\u27e80,y\u27e9 , \n and similarly for e(y)  and z(x) .\nSo now we have a concrete example  of\na  coalgebra  for this F.   Another\ncoalgebra for F uses the set N\u221e  of streams as its\ncarrier set.   The coalgebra itself is  \n\n\n(N\u221e, \n\u27e8head,\n  tail\u27e9 ).\n  \n\nThis coalgebra is final.   We shall not verify this here, but instead we\napply this point.\nBy finality, \n there is a unique \n e\u2020\u2009:\u2009X \u2192 \n N\u221e\nsuch that the diagram\nbelow commutes:\n\n\n\n\n\nFc\nf\u2192\nc\n\n\nF\u03b1\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u03b1\n\n\n\nN\u221e\n\u2192\u27e8\u2009head,\n  tail\u2009\u27e9\nN \u00d7 N\u221e\n\n\n\n\nWe now  follow the elements of X around the diagram\nboth ways.\nFor x, this tells us that \n\n\n\u27e8head,\n  tail\u27e9 \n  (e\u2020(x))\n  =\n \u27e80, e\u2020(y)\u27e9 \n\n\nThat is, \ne\u2020(x) is a stream whose\nfirst component is 0 and whose second component is \ne\u2020(y).\nSimilar observations hold for\ne\u2020(y)\nand e\u2020(z), of course.\nThe upshot is that\nthe three streams\ne\u2020(x),\ne\u2020(y)\nand e\u2020(z)\nare exactly the ones we are after.\n\n\nMuch the same applies to the tree example from\nSection 1.2.\n\n4.4 The axioms again\n\nAt this point we rephrase FA and AFA to make a comparison.\nRecall that V\n is the class of all sets, and that \n V = \u2118V.  This\nmeans that (trivially) the identity on the universe maps V onto\n\u2118V, and vice-versa.  Despite this, we want to introduce notation\nfor these two maps that makes them different.  We shall write\n\n i: \n     \u2118V \u2192 V\n\n\nThus i\ntakes a multiplicity (a set of sets) and\nregards it as a unity (a set).\nWe also have a map in the other direction\n\n j: V \u2192\u2118V\n\n\nThis j takes a set and regards it as a set \nof sets.\n\n\nThe Foundation Axiom in Algebraic Form.    Except for not being a set,\n(V, i)\n is an initial algebra for  \u2118:\nfor all sets a\n and all \n f\u2009:\u2009\u2118\n         a \u2192 a,\n there is a unique\n s\u2009:\u2009V \u2192 f\n  such that\nm \n = \n f  \u22c5 \u2118  m:\n \n\n\n\n\n\u2118V\ni\u2192\nV\n\n\n\u2118m\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\u00a0\u00a0m\n\n\n\n\u2118a\n\u2192f\na\n\n\n\n\nThe Anti-Foundation Axiom in Coalgebraic Form.\nExcept for not being a set,\n(V, j)\n is a final coalgebra for  \u2118:\nfor every set b\n and every \n e: b\u2192 \n     \u2118b,\nthere exists a unique \ns\u2009:\u2009b \u2192 V\n such that\ns   = \u2118 s \u22c5 e:\n\n\n\n\n\nb\ne\u2192\n\u2118b\n\n\ns\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\u00a0\u00a0\u2118s\n\n\n\nV\n\u2192i\n\u2118V\n\n\n\n\nThe map s  is called the solution to the system\ne.\n \n\nClass forms.   We  only mentioned forms of the axioms pertaining\nto sets.     They are a little nicer when\nstated as axioms  on  Class:\n\n\nFA is equivalent to the assertion that \n(V, i)\n is an initial algebra for \u2118\n on\nClass.\n\n\nAFA is equivalent to the assertion that \n(V, j)\n is a final coalgebra for \u2118 on\nClass.\n\n4.5 Conceptual comparison\n\nA chart just below  indicates a kind of  conceptual comparison \nof iterative and coiterative ideas.      \nThe entries towards the top are dualities in the categorical sense.\nMoving downwards, the rows in the chart are more like research directions\nthan actual results.    So spelling out the details in the chart is more like\nan ongoing research project than a settled matter.\n\n\nFor many functors on Set, especially polynomial functors\nand the finite power set functor, \nthe initial algebra is the least fixed point together with the identity.\nFor the polynomial functors, this least fixed point is \nitself an algebra of terms.   \n\n\n\n\n\nalgebra for a functor\ncoalgebra for a functor\n\n\ninitial algebra\nfinal coalgebra\n\n\nleast fixed point\ngreatest fixed point\n\n\ncongruence relation\nbisimulation equivalence relation\n\n\nequational logic\nmodal logic\n\n\nrecursion: map out of an initial algebra\ncorecursion: map into a final coalgebra\n\n\nFoundation Axiom   \nAnti-Foundation Axiom   \n\n\niterative conception\ncoiterative conception   \n\n\nset with operations   \n set with transitions and observations  \n\n\nuseful in syntax   \nuseful in semantics   \n\n\nbottom-up   \n top-down  \n\n\n\n\nThe connection between greatest fixed points and final coalgebras is the\ncontent of the following result.\n\n\nTheorem [Aczel]\nFor every power polynomial F on \nClass, the greatest fixed point \ntogether with the identity on it, (F*, id),\n is a final coalgebra of F on \nClass.\nMoreover, if F is a polynomial functor, then \nF* is a set, and \n (F*, id)\nis a final coalgebra of F on Set.\n\n\nThe original result used much weaker hypotheses on F, \nusing notions which we did not define, so \nour statement is rather weaker than in Aczel\u2019s book.   Several papers\nhave gone on to weaken strengthen this Final Coalgebra Theorem.\n\nBisimulation.\nWe have given the definition of bisimulation earlier,\nin Section 3.1.\nWe discussed it in connection with graphs, but the reader may also\nknow of a notion with the same name coming from modal logic.\nActually, the theory of coalgebra studies a more general notion,\nthat of bisimulation on a coalgebra for a given functor, defined first\nin Aczel and Mendler (1989).\nThis more general notion\nspecializes to several concepts which had been proposed in their own \nfields.     In addition, it is (nearly) the dual concept of a congruence on\nan algebra; this explains our line in \nthe conceptual comparison chart.\n\nEquational logic and modal logic.\nA great deal of work has shown ways in which equational logic\nand modal logic are \u201cdual\u201d,   but to spell this out in detail would\nrequire quite a bit more category theory than we need in the rest\nof this entry.\n\n\nThere is a growing field\nof coalgebraic generalizations of modal logic.   For a survey of\nthis area, see Kurz (2006).      \n\n\nThe final coalgebra\nof a functor may be regarded as a space of complete observations.\n(As with all our points in this section, this statement is mainly for functors on\nSet, and the notion of \u201ccomplete observation\u201d\nis, of course, merely suggestive.) For example, let \nAtProp be a set whose elements are\ncalled atomic propositions, and consider the functor\nF(a) = \u2118fin(a) \u00d7\n\u2118(AtProp ).  A coalgebra for this is a set a\ntogether with one map of a into its finite subsets, and\nanother map into the collection of sets of atomic propositions.\nPutting the two maps together gives a finitely-branching\nKripke model: each point has finitely many children and some set of\natomic propositions.  Now modal logic gives us a way of\n\u201cobserving\u201d properties of points in coalgebras (Kripke\nmodels).  And the record of everything that one could observe from a\npoint is the modal theory of that point.  Further, one may take the\ncollection of all theories of all points in all finitely-branching\nKripke models and make this collection (it is a set) into the carrier\nof a final coalgebra for the functor.  Indeed, this would be one way\nto construct a final coalgebra.\n\n\nCorecursion. Returning now to \nthe chart, we present an example of a corecursive\ndefinition.\n The equation for zip \ngiven above shows \n how the zip  function on streams is\nto work.    It should satisfy \n\n\nzip(s, t)    \u2009  = \u2009 \n\u27e8head(s), \n zip(t,\n  tail(s))\u27e9  \n  \n\nHere is how zip  is uniquely defined via a corecursive definition.\nWrite  N\u221e\u00d7\nN\u221e  as S in this discussion.\nWe want a map from S to N\u221e. \nWe are dealing with S as the final coalgebra of \n the functor Fa = N \u00d7 a.\n And we\u2019ll write the structure\n on the final coalgebra as\n\u27e8\u2009head, tail&thinsp;\u27e9, just as we did it in\nSection 1.1.\nThe idea is to turn  S into the carrier set\nof a coalgebra for, say  (S, f). \nThen zip\nwill be the unique coalgebra morphism from \n (S, f) to \n (S,\n\u27e8\u2009head,tail\u2009\u27e9 ).   \nIt remains to define f.\nLet \n\n\nf(s, t) =\n\u27e8head(s),\n \u27e8t, tail(s)\u27e9\u27e9 .\n\n\nAs mentioned, by finality there is a unique \nzip\u2009:\u2009S \u2192 N\u221e \n so that\nthe diagram below commutes:\n\n\n\n\n\nS\nf\u2192\nFS\n\n\nzip\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fzip\n\n\n\nN\u221e\n\u2192\n\u27e8head,tail\u27e9\nFN\u221e\n\n\n\n\nTo make sure that this works, we follow an arbitrary pair of streams,\nsay \n\u27e8s,t\u27e9  around the square, starting in the upper-left.\n  Going down, we have the stream\n   zip(s, t).\nFrom this, the structure takes this to\n\u27e8head(zip(s, t)),\n tail(zip(s, t))\u27e9\n \u2208 FN\u221e.\nBut we could also take our \n\u27e8s, t\u27e9  across the top via f to get \n\u27e8head(s), \n    \u27e8t, tail(s)\u27e9\u27e9.\nNow Fzip applies to this pair, and\n this is where the action of F as a functor\nenters.   We get \n\u27e8head(s),\nzip(tail(t), s)\u27e9.\nSo overall, we have \n\n\nzip(s, t))  \u2009  = \u2009  \n head(s) \n \n\n tail(zip(s, t)) \n   \u2009  = \u2009     \n   zip(tail(t), s)\n\n\njust as desired.    It says:  to zip two streams, start with the head of the first,\nand then repeat this very process on the second followed by the tail of the first.\n\n\nThe main point of this demonstration is that the principle of finality is \nsufficient to define and study corecursive definitions.    There are many further\ndevelopments in this area.\n\n\nSets, again. We have already discussed at length the lines in the table concerning \nthe Foundation and Anti-Foundation Axioms, and their attendant \nconceptual backgrounds.   The point of this section is to situate\nthat entire discussion inside of a larger one.\n\n\nExamples of final coalgebras and corecursive definitions. \nOur conceptual comparison makes the point that algebras embody \nsets with operations.    This point is almost too easy:   \nthe reason behind the terminology\nof  \u201calgebras\u201d in category theory is that sets with operations may be modeled\nas algebras in the categorical sense.    For coalgebras, it is harder to make the\ncase that they directly correspond to sets with either \u201ctransitions\u201d or \u201cobservations\u201d.\nHowever, we present a few examples that motivate this point.\n\n\n\n Functor Fa \n coalgebra \n final coalgebra \n logic \n\n\n S \u00d7 a \n stream system \n infinite streams over S \n a : \u03c6 for a \u2208  S \n\n\n (S \u00d7 a) + 1 \n stream system, allowing ends \n finite and infinite streams over S \n add an \u201cend of stream marker\u201d\n\n\n \u2118a\n graph = Kripke frame = system of set equations \n pointed graphs modulo bisimulation \n a fragment of infinitary modal, no atoms\n\n\n \u2118fina\n\u00d7 \u2118(AtProp)\n\n finitely branching Kripke model over the\nset  AtProp of atomic propositions\n a certain subset of the canonical model \n a fragment of modal logic over AtProp\n\n\n\nThe table above lists a few functors on Set \n  or \nClass  along with\nfinal coalgebras or other data from \nthe conceptual comparison chart.\n\n\nFirst, for any set S, the functor Fa = S\u00d7\n a.    \nA coalgebra for this F is a stream system of equations\nas we saw it in \nSection 1.1,\n except that there\nwe made things concrete and took S to be the set of natural numbers.\nThe final coalgebra is the set S\u221e =  S \u00d7\n  S\u221e  of \nstreams over S.\n   The logical language for this functor\nwould be a sentential  (propositional) language \nwhose sentences are either true  or of the form s : \u03c6\n where s\u2208S.\nThe semantics would be the obvious one; for example\n\n\n(0, 1, 2, 3, \u2026 )  \u22a8\n 0 : 1 : 2 : true.\n\n\nOne should note that  carrier of the  final coalgebra may be taken to be   \ncertain theories in this language.   These may be described extrinsically as\nthe theories of all points in all coalgebra.   It is more informative, however, to \nset down a logical system and then consider the maximal consistent sets in the system.\nWith the right definition, the maximal consistent sets do turn out to be the carrier of a\nfinal coalgebra for the functor.\n\n\nSecond, we consider Fa = (S \u00d7 a)   + 1.\nHere 1 = {0} and + is the disjoint union operation.   However, it is \nmore common for people to represent the one and only element of \n1 using a symbol like *.\nThe coalgebras are like stream systems of equations, except now an\nequation might ask for a stream to \u201cstop\u201d by having * on the right-hand \nside.\nSo an example of a coalgebra would be \nx \u2248 \n\u27e8s,y\u27e9 ,\n y \u2248 *.\nThen the solution would  take \nx\u2020  to be the one-term sequence  s.\nThe logic for this functor would be the same logic (HML) as before, except that\nnow we add an atomic sentence to detect the ends of finite sequences.\n \n\nTurning to the last two lines,  we already know that AFA is equivalent to\nthe assertion that  (V, id)\n is a final coalgebra of \u2118; also, even without \nAFA, we have a final coalgebra whose carrier set is the pointed graphs modulo\nbisimulation.   The logic in this case is infinitary modal logic,\nactually, it is a fragment of this logic.   It turns\nout that two points in a given coalgebra have the same infinitary modal theory\niff they are bisimilar.\n \n\nThe line concerning \u2118fin(a) \u00d7\n \u2118(AtProp) is the closest to \nthe Kripke semantics of modal logic.   One might hope that the final coalgebra\nwould turn out to be the canonical model of the modal logic \nK, but this is not\nquite right.    One needs to cut down to those maximal consistent sets which are\nrealized by some point in some finitely branching model.\n \nAs the reader may notice, we are being extremely vague about matters\nconcerning the logics: is there a principled explanation of where they come from?\nWhat, if anything,\nis the relation between the final coalgebras and canonical models\nas we find them in modal logic?  The explanations here are too long and too\ninvolved for this entry.   Once again,\none place to start reading about these matters is Kurz (2006).\n\n\nThe lines in at the bottom of the  conceptual comparison chart\n are the  most programmatic of all.\n \nDoing without AFA: final coalgebras\nin ZF. We mentioned in note [2] that it is possible to alter the pairing\noperation in such a way that one may prove many of the results that\nour treatment obtains only by using ZFA.  This points is\nmentioned in Forster (1994) and developed in detail in Paulson (1999)\n(and in other papers by Paulson). One replaces the Kuratowski pair\n\u27e8x,y\u27e9 with a variant,\n({0}\u00d7 a)\u222a ({1}\u00d7 b).  (This is the\nusual disjoint union operation, also called the coproduct on\nsets.)  Then one defines variants of other notions: the cartesian\nproduct, functions, etc.  And in terms of these one can indeed study\nstreams and infinite trees, and many other sets of interest in this\nentry.  Even more, one can prove\nfinal coalgebra theorems, stating sufficient conditions\nfor the existence of a final coalgebra whose structure is the identity.\n(This is an important point for this line of work: in ZF we can \nshow the existence of final coalgebras for the same functors as in\nZFA, but in the latter theory we can get final coalgebras whose\nstructure maps are the identity.)\n\n\nOne might think that this move undermines much of the interest\nin AFA.     For Paulson, the reduction is important since he wants\nto use an automatic theorem prover to work with assertions in set theory.\nIt makes sense to work out detailed reductions so as to avoid changing\nthe set theory.    \n\nOtthers may not find this conclusive, for two reasons.  First, the\nmethod doesn\u2019t apply to equations like x =\n{x}, or to collections like\nx = \u2118fin(x).  The latter kind of\nequation is especially useful in applications.  But even more, what\nwill be of interest will be the whole assembly of what we might\ncall coalgebraic concepts: coinduction, corecursion, and\ntop-down treatments of various phenomena.  Someone who is using these\nconcepts and is also worried about modeling in set theory would\nprobably find it convenient to work with AFA, even if many of\nthe end applications could be done in standard set theory.\n \n\nTo put things differently, and to ask a question that surely belongs\nin this entry, why should one work with AFA instead\nof FA?  Much depends on the purposes one brings to set\ntheoretic modeling in the first place.  For most purposes, including\nmost of mathematics, it makes little or no difference.  To model some\ncircular phenomena, it turns out to be convenient to work with final\ncoalgebras of various functors.  It is especially nice with the\nstructure maps on those final coalgebras may be taken to be the\nidentity function.  For example, this would allow us to say that a\nstream of numbers really and truly is an ordered pair of a number and\na stream.  In this case, having AFA would be nice, but the\nresults above show that in many of the interesting cases, it is not\nactually needed.  On the other hand, if one is content to work with\nisomorphisms, then having the structure map be the identity is a kind\nof \u201coptional extra\u201d.  Further, the question of which axiom\nto adopt might appear to be besides the point.\n\n  Interested readers may consult the following supplementary\ndocument for a discussion of how the more general ideas from coalgebra\nand closely related fields help with discussions of the kinds of\nmathematical circularity which we looked at previously. \n   \n\nAdditional related modeling of circularity\n\nConclusion\n\n This entry has two major thrusts.  First, it introduced\nnon-wellfounded sets and described some of the mathematics around\nthem.  It was not comprehensive in this regard, and one should see\nPeter Aczel\u2019s book (1988) for much more, including\ndiscussions of axioms besides AFA that we did not even mention.\nOne could also see Barwise and Moss (1996) for more on some of the\npoints that were touched on \nhere.[13]\n The presentation owes much to work in coalgebra that began\nshortly after these books appeared.  So readers familiar with either\nof them would still find something new in the first sections of the\nentry.\n\n The other thrust had to do with the conceptual points made in\nSection 4.5.\nThe idea is to situate the\nmathematics of set theoretic circularity inside a larger topic,\ncoalgebra, and then to understand both points in terms of a larger\ndivision between \u201cbottom-up\u201d and \u201ctop-down\u201d\nideas.  This larger discussion is more programmatic than we would\nlike, and much remains to be done on it.  Our hope is that it helps\nreaders understand set theoretic circularity, both how it\nworks, and also why it is attractive.",
