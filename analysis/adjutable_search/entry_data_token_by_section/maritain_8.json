General Assessment\n\nAt the time of his death, Maritain was arguably the best known\nCatholic philosopher in the world. The breadth of his philosophical\nwork, his influence in the social philosophy of the Catholic Church,\nand his ardent defenses of human rights made him one of the central\nfigures of his times. His writings influenced a range of figures, from\nThomas Merton, Yves Simon, and Gabriel Marcel (with whom, however, he\nwas later estranged), to Saul Alinksy, Martin Luther King, Paul\nMartin, and Eduardo Frei in politics, to artists such as Bernanos,\nJulien Green, and Louri\u00e9, and to Popes John XXIII and Paul VI\n(the latter having translated two of Maritain\u2019s books into\nItalian, and who honored Maritain by presenting the \u201cMessage to\nMen of Thought and Science\u201d to him at the close of the Second\nVatican Council, in 1965).\n\nMaritain\u2019s philosophical work has been translated into some\ntwenty languages. As is evident from the preceding remarks, it covers\na wide range of areas\u2014though much of it was written for a\ngeneral, rather than a professional academic, audience. Still, some of\nMaritain\u2019s writings are polemical and, because much of his\nconcern (especially in the history of philosophy) was to address very\nspecific philosophical and theological issues of his time, these texts\nmay have a rather dated character.\n\nMaritain\u2019s most enduring legacy is undoubtedly his moral and\npolitical philosophy, and the influence of his work on human rights\ncan be seen, not only in the United Nations Declaration of 1948 but,\nit has been claimed, in a number of national declarations, such as the\nCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the preamble to the\nConstitution of the Fourth French Republic (1946)\u2014this last was\nlikely a reflection of Maritain\u2019s lengthy correspondence with\nthe French war hero and, later, President, General Charles DeGaulle.\nMaritain\u2019s Christian humanism and personalism have also had a\nsignificant influence in the social encyclicals of Pope Paul VI and in\nthe thought of Pope John Paul II. Interestingly, since the end of the\nCold War, there has been a revival of Maritain\u2019s political ideas\nin Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nTwo other areas in which Maritain\u2019s thought has been influential\nare his aesthetics and his philosophy of education. Although no longer\nas strong as they once were, they were particularly significant in\nLatin America and French-speaking Africa from the 1930s until recent\nyears. Maritain\u2019s work in epistemology, though clearly essential\nto his political and religious thought and to his aesthetics, has not,\nhowever, had the reception Maritain would have held it deserved.\n\nIt is not easy to place Maritain\u2019s work within the history of\nphilosophy in the twentieth century. Clearly, his influence was\nstrongest in those countries where Thomistic philosophy had pride of\nplace. While his political philosophy led him, at least in his time,\nto be considered a liberal and even a social democrat, he eschewed\nsocialism and, in Le paysan de la Garonne, was an early\ncritic of many of the religious reforms that followed the Second\nVatican Council. One can say, then, that he would be considered by\npresent-day liberals as too conservative, and by many conservatives as\ntoo liberal. Again, though generally considered to be a Thomist, the\nextent to which he was is a matter of some debate. Indeed, according\nto Etienne Gilson, Maritain\u2019s \u2018Thomism\u2019 was really\nan epistemology and, hence, not a real Thomism at all. There is, not\nsurprisingly, no generally shared view of the precise character of\nMaritain\u2019s philosophy.\n\nMaritain\u2019s work nevertheless remains influential. Since 1958\nthere has been a Jacques Maritain Center at the University of Notre\nDame in the United States, there are journals devoted to his work,\nsuch as \u00c9tudes maritainiennes / Maritain Studies,\nNotes et documents, and the Cahiers Jacques et\nRa\u00efssa Maritain, and there are currently some twenty\nnational associations which meet regularly, in addition to the\nInstitut International Jacques Maritain. The continuity of\ninterest in his thought in the English-speaking world led, in the mid\n1990s, the University of Notre Dame Press to undertake the publication\nof a Collected Works of the English-language editions of\nMaritain\u2019s writings.\n",
