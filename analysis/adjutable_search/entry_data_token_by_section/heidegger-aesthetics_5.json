    "main_text": "Heidegger\u2019s Philosophical Critique of Aesthetics: Introduction || Symptoms of Subjectivism\n2.3 Symptoms of Subjectivism\n\n\nThis returns us to the bigger question we have been pursuing, and\nwhich we are now prepared to answer: Why exactly does Heidegger\nobject to our contemporary tendency to understand and approach art in\nthis aesthetic way? In the revealingly titled essay we have been\ndrawing on, \u201cThe Age of the World Picture,\u201d Heidegger\nexplains that \u201cthe process by which art gets pushed into the\nhorizon of aesthetics\u201d is neither conceptually neutral nor\nhistorically unimportant. On the contrary, the historical process\nby which Western humanity came to understand art as\n\u201caesthetics\u201d is so freighted with significance that it\nneeds to be recognized as \u201cone of the essential phenomena of the\ncontemporary age\u201d (QCT 116/GA5 75). Strikingly, Heidegger\ngoes so far as to assert that our tendency to treat art as aesthetics\nis just as significant for and revealing of our current historical\nself-understanding as are the increasing dominance of science and\ntechnology, the tendency to conceive of all meaningful human activity\nin terms of culture, and the growing absence of any god or gods in our\nWestern world (QCT 116\u20137/GA5 75\u20136). This is a surprising and\ndeliberately provocative claim, one apparently meant to provoke us into\nnoticing and thinking through something we ordinarily overlook.\nFor, how can our understanding of art as aesthetics be just as\nessential to our current historical self-understanding as are the\ndominance of science, the growing influence of technology, the\nubiquitous discussions of \u201cculture,\u201d and the withdrawal of\ngods from our history\u2014four seemingly much larger and more\nmomentous historical developments?\n\n\nThese five \u201cessential phenomena\u201d\u2014the historical\nascendance of science, technology, aesthetics, and culture, on the one\nhand, and, on the other, that historical decline of the divine which\nHeidegger (echoing Schiller) calls the \u201cungodding\u201d or\n\u201cdegodification\u201d (Entg\u00f6tterung) of the\nworld\u2014these all are \u201cequally essential\u201d\n(gleichwesentliche), Heidegger explains, because these five\ninterlocking phenomena express and so reveal the underlying direction\nin which the contemporary world is moving historically. Science,\ntechnology, aesthetics, culture, and degodification are \u201cequally\nessential\u201d as five major historical developments that feed into\nand disclose (what we could think of\nas) the current, that is, the underlying historical\ndirection or Zeitgeist of our contemporary\n world.[19] \n In the late 1930s, Heidegger\u2019s name for the underlying direction in which\nthe age is moving is \u201csubjectivism,\u201d a movement he defines\nas humanity\u2019s ongoing attempt to establish \u201cmastery over the\ntotality of what-is\u201d (QCT 132/GA5 92). Subjectivism, in\nother words, designates humanity\u2019s increasingly global quest to\nachieve complete control over every aspect of our objective reality,\nto establish ourselves as the being \u201cwho gives the measure and\nprovides the guidelines for everything that is\u201d (QCT 134/GA5\n94). Heidegger\u2019s fundamental objection to the aesthetic approach to\nart, then, is that such an approach follows from and feeds back\ninto subjectivism, contemporary humanity\u2019s ongoing effort to\nestablish \u201cour unlimited power for calculating, planning, and\nmolding [or \u2018breeding,\u2019 Z\u00fcchtung] all\nthings\u201d (QCT 135/GA5 94).\n",
