    "main_text": "Freedom and Responsibility\n8. Moral Principles and Particular Judgments\n\nThe history of moral theory is a history of attempts to identify,\narticulate, and defend general moral principles that serve to explain\nwhen and why various types of action, institutions, or characters\ncount as right or wrong, just or unjust, virtuous or vicious. The\nassumption has consistently been that there is a general and\nprincipled account of morality to be given. And this assumption has\nsurvived the fact that few people think any particular set of\nprinciples that we have actually succeeded in articulating, is fully\nadequate. What explains the assumption? Why not hold, as\nparticularists do, that there may well be no set of general principles\nthat adequately mark moral distinctions? Or, why not think, as\nskeptics do, that our repeated failures actually to identify fully\nadequate principles shows that morality is a chimera? (See the entries\non\n moral particularism\n and\n moral particularism and moral generalism.)\n\nWrestling with these questions returns one immediately and directly to\nwondering about the nature of morality and the role it is supposed to\nplay in human life. What is it about morality\u2019s nature, or its\nrole, that would make sense of the idea that general principles are\nessential to it? Why not suppose that one case of cruelty might be\nwrong, and another not wrong, without there being any ground that\nwould justify treating them as different? Why is it so natural to\nsuppose that there must be some other difference\u2014say a\ndifference in their consequences, or a difference in what has led up\nto the act of cruelty\u2014that underwrites and justifies the thought\nthat one is wrong, but not the other? Why not grant that one of the\ntwo just happened to be wrong and the other happened not to be? Could\nnot moral properties just happen to have been distributed randomly so\nthat, in the end, there is no justification for one action having a\ncertain moral standing while another, otherwise the same, has a\ndifferent standing? These suggested possibilities are, I believe, not\nreal possibilities at all. They would each entail that moral demands\nare fundamentally arbitrary in a way that is incompatible with\nmorality\u2019s claim to authority. But what is it about morality\nthat precludes it being fundamentally arbitrary? A good answer, I\nsuspect, will lead one away from the idea that moral properties are\nmerely there in the world to be found, wholly independent of our\nconcerns and practices. But a good answer is needed. And a good answer\nis not provided simply by supplying, if one could, a consistent and\ncoherent set of principles that successfully systematized particular\nmoral judgments about acts, institutions, and characters. The\nchallenge here is not simply to show that moral judgments can be seen\nto fit a pattern; the challenge is to show that the pattern they\nfit\u2014the principle(s) to which they conform\u2014work to explain\nand justify their importance.\n",
