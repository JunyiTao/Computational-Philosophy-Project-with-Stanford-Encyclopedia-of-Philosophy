    "main_text": "The Extant Paradoxes || Other Paradoxes\n2.3 Other Paradoxes\n\n\nAristotle also gestures toward two additional ingenious arguments by \nZeno, versions of which were also known to Simplicius.\n2.3.1 The Millet Seed\n\n\n\u201cZeno\u2019s argument is not correct, that any portion of millet \nseed whatsoever makes a sound\u201d (Arist. Ph. \n7.5, 250a20\u20131). The version of this argument known to \nSimplicius represents Zeno as engaged in a fictional argument with \nProtagoras, wherein he makes the point that if a large number of \nmillet seeds makes a sound (for example, when poured out in a heap), \nthen one seed or even one ten-thousandth of a seed should also make \nits own sound (for example, in that process) (Simp. in Ph. \n1108.18\u201328). Aristotle\u2019s report is too slight a basis for \nreconstructing how Zeno may in fact have argued, and Simplicius is \nevidently reporting some later reworking. The evidence nonetheless \nsuggests that Zeno anticipated reasoning related to that of the \nsorites paradox, apparently invented more than a century later.\n2.3.2 A Paradox of Place\n\n\nToward the end of the introduction to his analysis of place, \nAristotle notes that \u201cZeno\u2019s difficulty requires some \nexplanation; for if every thing that is is in a place, it is clear \nthat there will also be a place of the place, and so on to \ninfinity\u201d (Arist. Ph. 4.1, 209a23\u20135). His \nsubsequent statement of the problem is even briefer but adds one key \npoint: \u201cZeno raises the problem that, if place is something, it\nwill be in something\u201d (Arist. Ph. \n4.3, 210b22\u20133; cf. Eudemus fr. 78 Wehrli, [Arist.] De \nMelisso Xenophane Gorgia 979b23\u20137, Simp. in \nPh. 562, 3\u20136). Zeno would appear to have argued as follows. \nEverything that is is in something, namely a place. If a place is \nsomething, then it too must be in something, namely some further \nplace. If this second place is something, it must be in yet another \nplace; and the same reasoning applies to this and each successive \nplace ad infinitum. Thus, if there is such a thing as place,\nthere must be limitless places everywhere, which is absurd. \nTherefore, there is no such thing as place. This argument could well \nhave formed part of a more elaborate argument against the view that \nthere are many things, such as that if there are many things, they \nmust be somewhere, i.e. in some place; but there is no such thing as \nplace and thus no place for the many to be; therefore, there are not \nmany things. This is, however, only speculation.\n",
