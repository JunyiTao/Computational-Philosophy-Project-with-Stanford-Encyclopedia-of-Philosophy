    "main_text": "Human Psychology and Ethics\n3. Human Psychology and Ethics\n\n The drama of human life is viewed by Plotinus against the axis of\nGood and evil outlined above.  The human person is essentially a soul\nemploying a body as an instrument of its temporary embodied life (see\nI 1).  Thus, Plotinus distinguishes between the person and the\ncomposite of soul and body.  That person is identical with a cognitive\nagent or subject of cognitive states (see I 1. 7).  An embodied person\nis, therefore, a conflicted entity, capable both of thought and of\nbeing the subject of the composite\u2019s non-cognitive states, such as\nappetites and emotions.\n\n This conflicted state or duality of personhood is explained by the\nnature of cognition, including rational desire.  Rational agents are\ncapable of being in embodied states, including states of desire, and\nof being cognitively aware that they are in these states.  So, a\nperson can be hungry or tired and be cognitively aware that he is in\nthis state, where cognitive awareness includes being able to\nconceptualize that state.  But Plotinus holds that the state of\ncognitive awareness more closely identifies the person than does the\nnon-cognitive state.  He does so on the grounds that all embodied or\nenmattered intelligible reality is an image of its eternal paradigm in\nIntellect.  In fact, the highest part of the person, one\u2019s own\nintellect, the faculty in virtue of which persons can engage in\nnon-discursive thinking, is eternally \u2018undescended\u2019.  It\nis eternally doing what Intellect is doing.  And the reason for\nholding this is, based on Plotinus\u2019 interpretation of Plato\u2019s\nRecollection Argument in Phaedo (72e-78b), that our ability to\nengage successfully in embodied cognition depends on our having access\nto Forms.  But the only access to Forms is eternal access by cognitive\nidentification with them.  Otherwise, we would have only images or\nrepresentations of the Forms.  So, we must now be cognitively\nidentical with them if we are going also to use these Forms as a way\nof classifying and judging things in the sensible world.\n\n A person in a body can choose to take on the role of a non-cognitive\nagent by acting solely on appetite or emotion.  In doing so, that\nperson manifests a corrupted desire, a desire for what is evil, the\nmaterial aspect of the bodily.  Alternatively, a person can distance\nhimself from these desires and identify himself with his rational\nself.  The very fact that this is possible supplies Plotinus with\nanother argument for the supersensible identity of the person.\n\n Owing to the conflicted states of embodied persons, they are subject\nto self-contempt and yet, paradoxically, \u2018want to belong to\nthemselves\u2019.  Persons have contempt for themselves because one\nhas contempt for what is inferior to oneself.  Insofar as persons\ndesire things other than what Intellect desires, they desire things\nthat are external to themselves.  But the subject of such desires is\ninferior to what is desired, even if this be a state of fulfilled\ndesire.  In other words, if someone wants to be in state B when he is\nin state A, he must regard being in state A as worse than being in\nstate B.  But all states of embodied desire are like this.  Hence, the\nself-contempt.\n\n Persons want to belong to themselves insofar as they identify\nthemselves as subjects of their idiosyncratic desires.  They do this\nbecause they have forgotten or are unaware of their true identity as\ndisembodied intellects.  If persons recognize their true identity,\nthey would not be oriented to the objects of their embodied desire but\nto the objects of intellect.  They would be able to look upon the\nsubject of those embodied desires as alien to their true selves.\n\n   Plotinus views ethics according to the criterion of what\ncontributes to our identification with our higher selves and what\ncontributes to our separation from that identification.  All virtuous\npractices make a positive contribution to this goal.  But virtues can\nbe graded according to how they do this (see I 2).  The lowest form of\nvirtues, what Plotinus, following Plato, calls \u2018civic\u2019 or\n\u2018popular\u2019, are the practices that serve to control the\nappetites (see I 2. 2).  By contrast, higher\n\u2018purificatory\u2019 virtues are those that separate the person\nfrom the embodied human being (I 2. 3).  One who practices\npurificatory virtue is no longer subject to the incontinent desires\nwhose restraint constitutes mere civic or popular virtue.  Such a\nperson achieves a kind of \u2018likeness to God\u2019 recommended by\nPlato at Theaetetus 176a-b.  Both of these types of virtue are\ninferior to intellectual virtue which consists in the activity of the\nphilosopher (see I 2. 6).  One who is purified in embodied practices\ncan turn unimpeded to one\u2019s true self-identity as a thinker.\n\n\nPlotinus, however, while acknowledging the necessity of virtuous\nliving for happiness, refuses to identify them.  Like Aristotle,\nPlotinus maintains that a property of the happy life is its\nself-sufficiency (see I.1.4\u20135).  But Plotinus does not agree that a\nlife focused on the practice of virtue is self-sufficient.  Even\nAristotle concedes that such a life is not self-sufficient in the\nsense that it is immune to misfortune.  Plotinus, insisting that the\nbest life is one that is in fact blessed owing precisely to its\nimmunity to misfortune, alters the meaning of\n\u2018self-sufficient\u2019 in order to identify it with the\ninterior life of the excellent person.  This interiority or\nself-sufficiency is the obverse of attachment to the objects of\nembodied desires.  Interiority is happiness because the longing for\nthe Good, for one who is ideally an intellect, is satisfied by\ncognitive identification with all that is intelligible.  If this is\nnot unqualifiedly possible for the embodied human being, it does at\nleast seem possible that one should have a second order desire,\nderiving from this longing for the Good, that amounts to a profound\nindifference to the satisfaction of first order desires.\nUnderstanding that the good for an intellect is contemplation of all\nthat the One is means that the will is oriented to one thing only,\nwhatever transient desires may turn up.\n",
