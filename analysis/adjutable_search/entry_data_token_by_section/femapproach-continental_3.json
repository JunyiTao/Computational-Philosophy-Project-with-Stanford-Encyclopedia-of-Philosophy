Continental Feminism and Queer Theory/Queer of Color Critique\n\nThe relationship between Continental feminism and queer theory is\nsimultaneously productive and fraught. While far from exhaustive, this\nentry will first highlight some of the overlapping figures and\napproaches between the two fields, including examples of scholarship\nat their intersections. It will then briefly introduce one account of\nthe tension between them. Finally, it will close with some reflections\non the shared problems across these fields, including their\nhistorically white and Anglo-Eurocentric approaches, as well as how\nrecent work in queer of color critique aligns with and points to new\ndirections in Continental feminism.\n\nIn the late 1980s and the early 1990s, \u201cqueer\u201d emerged as\na reclamation of a homophobic slur and a rallying cry for a coalition\nof the marginalized against the tyranny of the normal (Barker &\nScheele 2016; D. Hall & Jagose 2012; Warner 1993; Sedgwick 1993;\nAnzald\u00faa 1991 [2009]). Formed in the crucible of the AIDS\ncrisis, which sharpened the need to understand the violence\nexperienced by people excluded by norms related to gender and\nsexuality, \u201cqueer\u201d was meant to bring attention to the\nrange of sexual/gender practices deemed outside the purview of the\nnormal. In one genealogy of queer theory, the field develops this\nearly activist reclamation of the term queer into a wide-reaching\ncritique of how norms operate in and through dominant\nconceptualizations of identity. Given this motivating impulse of\ndeconstruction, or of denaturalizing categories such as sexuality, it\nis perhaps of no surprise that queer theory has historically been a\nfield well-populated with figures (e.g., Lacan, Foucault, Derrida) and\nmethodological approaches (poststructuralism, psychoanalysis,\nphenomenology) that have been associated with Continental philosophy,\nespecially twentieth century European philosophy.\n\nQueer theory frequently draws on, critiques, and expands the ideas of\nmany figures and approaches that are seen as early progenitors of\nContinental feminism (e.g., Beauvoir, Irigaray, Kristeva, feminist\nphenomenology, feminist poststructuralism, critical theory,\npsychoanalytic theory). As Jagose (2009) points out, however, the\ncritique of normative identity categories was not invented by queer\ntheory, given that feminist scholarship has a rich history of\nradically disrupting the category of women along lines of race and\nsexuality. Moreover, the lines between feminism and queer theory are\nhistorically blurred. For example, Judith Butler\u2014who is often\ncited as an originator of queer theory\u2014explicitly marks her\nearly work as occurring in the intersection of these fields (as well\nas a number of other critical discourses) (1997). In Gender\nTrouble (1990) and Bodies that Matter (1993), Butler\ndraws on Continental feminist figures such as Irigaray, Beauvoir, and\nKristeva, and methods ranging from psychoanalysis to poststructuralism\nand phenomenology to develop a simultaneously queer and feminist\ntheoretical lens focused on understanding the relationship between\ngender and sexuality, as well as the operation of norms and identity\ncategories more broadly (Salih 2002).\n\nA second major figure in the relationship between Continental feminism\nand queer theory is Michel Foucault, who has been extensively used in\nboth queer and Continental (and specifically poststructuralist)\nfeminist theory, but who (as opposed to Butler) did not explicitly use\nthe terms queer and feminist. While a larger account of the connection\nbetween Foucault and queer theory is beyond the scope of this entry,\nthe relationship is a rich one. In the late 1980s, Foucault\u2019s\nThe History of Sexuality, Volume One was read\nheavily by activists and scholars questioning dominant narratives\naround sexuality and identity (Halperin 1995); Foucault\u2019s work\nwas also influential not only for Judith Butler\u2019s Gender\nTrouble (1990) but also for another text often cited as\nfoundational for queer theory, Eve Sedgwick\u2019s Epistemology\nof the Closet (1990 [2008]). \n\nFoucault\u2019s genealogical approach to identity, including his\nexploration of the histories and models of power at work in modern\nconceptions of sexuality, has been important for a number of\ncontemporary scholars working at the intersections of feminism and\nqueer theory (Huffer 2010 and 2020; Russell 2010; Sawicki 2005;\nSchotten 2018; Winnubst 2006). For example, Ladelle McWhorter (1999)\ntakes up Foucault\u2019s account of ethics as a practice of the self,\nor how we work on ourselves to become particular kinds of people,\nthrough a queer framework that resists expected developmental\ntrajectories and normative timelines of a life (e.g., heterosexual\ncoupling resulting in marriage and children). And in a different vein,\nJasbir Puar (2007) has drawn on Foucault\u2019s theories of power (as\nwell as a wide range of interdisciplinary theory including\npostcolonial feminist theory) to analyze the relationship between\ncontemporary biopower and homonationalism, or how certain\n\u201cgood\u201d gay and lesbian subjects, by aligning themselves\nwith U.S. imperialism, are welcomed into the nation-state.\n\nFigures associated with Continental feminism who do not necessarily\nmark themselves or their work as queer have also been used in queer\ntheoretical projects, just as feminists have historically done with\nany number of non-feminist philosophers. For example, queer studies\nscholars have explored the relative absence of Irigaray in queer\ntheory, argued for the queer resources of her thinking (Huffer 2013;\nWinnubst 2006), called attention to the potential use of\nIrigaray\u2019s disruption of binaries for queer analyses of identity\n(Butler 1993: 36\u201339; Grosz 1989), and used Irigarayan concepts\nto develop queer analyses of longstanding feminist issues, such as the\nexperience of breast feeding (R. Lee 2018).\n\nPhenomenological methods can also track this traffic between\nContinental feminism and queer theory. For example, Sara Ahmed\u2019s\nQueer Phenomenology (2006) explores the use of phenomenology\nin queer studies by asking, among other questions, how to understand\nthe \u201corientation\u201d of sexual orientation as the way bodies\nare directed towards particular objects and away from others. In\ndeveloping this queer use of phenomenology, Ahmed acknowledges her\ndebt to feminist philosophers of the body such as Sandra Bartky, Iris\nMarion Young, Rosalyn Diprose, and Gail Weiss, as well as early\nphenomenologists such as de Beauvoir and phenomenologists of race\nincluding Linda Alcoff, Frantz Fanon, and Lewis Gordon.\n\nGiven these examples of the overlap of figures and approaches in\nContinental feminism and queer theory, it is worth asking what\ndistinguishes the approaches. One may be tempted to say that feminism\nfocuses more on gender (historically, within continental feminism,\nthis may be more commonly discussed as sexual difference) and queer\ntheory focuses more on sexuality (including questions of pleasure,\ndesire, and eroticism). Yet many working within Continental feminism,\nespecially as inflected with French theory, also focus on questions\nrelated to sexuality such as pleasure, desire, and eroticism. And\nthere are also reasons to be suspicious of how the gender-sexuality\nsplit is narrated as a feminist-queer split. While some have argued\nthat there are good reasons to draw distinctions between these fields\nin order to do justice to their distinct concerns (G. Rubin 2011;\nHalley 2006), there have also been many challenges to overly\nprogrammatic forms of this separation (Huffer 2013) and accounts of\nhow this narrative can overlook the field\u2019s mutual interest in\nunderstanding the complex relationship between gender and sexuality,\nas well as the possibility of a queer feminism (Jagose 2009).\nNevertheless, despite the overlaps in figures and archives, as well as\nthe wealth of resources in queer theory on topics that Continental\nfeminist philosophers hold dear (temporality, embodiment, identity,\nand desire, to name only a few), the relatively slow uptake of texts\nmarked explicitly as queer theory has been noticeable (Winnubst 2010).\nThis is not to erase the important work done at the intersections of\nthese fields but to acknowledge that the relationship is not a\nseamless one. In their introductory comments to a \u201cRoundtable on\nContinental Feminism\u201d, Lynne Huffer and Shannon Winnubst (2017)\nnote the relative lack of engagement with queer theory among the\ncontributions, and they ask whether Continental feminism is capacious\nenough to embrace queer theory, a question that has also been posed to\nphilosophy more broadly (Ahmed 2016b; Salamon 2009; Winnubst\n2010).\n\nFinally, both Continental feminism and queer theory have also been\nextensively critiqued for the whiteness and Anglo-Eurocentric nature\nof their archives. In one particularly well-known rendition of this\ncritique, Cathy Cohen asks whether queer theory has lived up to its\nanti-identitarian promise of creating coalitions across difference\n(2005). As a way to intervene in the whiteness of queer theory\n(Johnson and Henderson 2005), Roderick Ferguson (2004) coined the\nterm \u201cqueer of color critique\u201d to describe how various\nintersections of race, gender, sexuality, and class operate in\nnationalistic discourses of identity and belonging; it is, in\nFerguson\u2019s words,\n\n\na heterogenous enterprise made up of women of color feminism,\nmaterialist analysis, poststructuralist theory, and queer critique.\n(Ferguson 2004: 149)\n\n\nOther notable and early contributors to this sub-field include\nJos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, E. Patrick Johnson, Chandan Reddy, and\nGayatri Gopinath. Although the topics at work in queer of color\ncritique concerning identity, embodiment, temporality, and affect have\nalso been topics of central interests to Continental feminists, the\nuptake of queer of color critique, as with queer theory, has been slow\nin Continental feminism. However, as Continental feminism\nexpands\u2014as shown through this entry\u2014 the resources of\nqueer theory and queer of color critique are waiting in the wings as\ncrucial, if at times under acknowledged, interlocutors.\n\nLike Continental feminism, queer theory and queer of color critique\ncontinue the longstanding feminist tradition of sending texts and\nideas in directions they were perhaps never intended to travel. Recent\ntrajectories at the crossroads of Continental feminism and queer\nstudies include attention to neoliberal capitalism (Winnubst 2015;\nMcWhorter 2012), sex and gender in ancient Greek metaphysics (Bianchi\n2014); critical disability theory (Puar 2017; K. Hall 2014; Yergeau\n2018; and Gallop 2019), Latina feminism and existential phenomenology\n(Ortega 2016), affect and temporality (Ahmed 2019; Amin 2017; Freeman\n2019), and materialism and concepts of agency (Chen 2012). As explored\nin the next section, another important interlocutor with both\nContinental feminism and queer theory is transgender studies.\n",
