For them, both are\nsocially constructed:\n\nIf the immutable character of sex is contested, perhaps this construct\ncalled \u2018sex\u2019 is as culturally constructed as gender;\nindeed, perhaps it was always already gender, with the consequence\nthat the distinction between sex and gender turns out to be no\ndistinction at all. (Butler 1999, 10\u201311)\n\n\n(Butler is not alone in claiming that there are no tenable\ndistinctions between nature/culture, biology/construction and\nsex/gender. See also: Antony 1998; Gatens 1996; Grosz 1994; Prokhovnik\n1999.) Butler makes two different claims in the passage cited: that\nsex is a social construction, and that sex is gender. To unpack their\nview, consider the two claims in turn. First, the idea that sex is a\nsocial construct, for Butler, boils down to the view that our sexed\nbodies are also performative and, so, they have \u201cno ontological\nstatus apart from the various acts which constitute [their]\nreality\u201d (1999, 173). Prima facie, this implausibly\nimplies that female and male bodies do not have independent existence\nand that if gendering activities ceased, so would physical bodies.\nThis is not Butler\u2019s claim; rather, their position is that\nbodies viewed as the material foundations on which gender is\nconstructed, are themselves constructed as if they provide\nsuch material foundations (Butler 1993). Cultural conceptions about\ngender figure in \u201cthe very apparatus of production whereby sexes\nthemselves are established\u201d (Butler 1999, 11).\n\nFor Butler, sexed bodies never exist outside social meanings and how\nwe understand gender shapes how we understand sex (1999, 139). Sexed\nbodies are not empty matter on which gender is constructed and sex\ncategories are not picked out on the basis of objective features of\nthe world. Instead, our sexed bodies are themselves discursively\nconstructed: they are the way they are, at least to a substantial\nextent, because of what is attributed to sexed bodies and how they are\nclassified (for discursive construction, see Haslanger 1995, 99). Sex\nassignment (calling someone female or male) is normative (Butler 1993,\n 1).[6]\n When the doctor calls a newly born infant a girl or a boy, s/he is\nnot making a descriptive claim, but a normative one. In fact, the\ndoctor is performing an illocutionary speech act (see the entry on\n Speech Acts).\n In effect, the doctor\u2019s utterance makes infants into girls or\nboys. We, then, engage in activities that make it seem as if sexes\nnaturally come in two and that being female or male is an objective\nfeature of the world, rather than being a consequence of certain\nconstitutive acts (that is, rather than being performative). And this\nis what Butler means in saying that physical bodies never exist\noutside cultural and social meanings, and that sex is as socially\nconstructed as gender. They do not deny that physical bodies exist.\nBut, they take our understanding of this existence to be a\nproduct of social conditioning: social conditioning makes the\nexistence of physical bodies intelligible to us by discursively\nconstructing sexed bodies through certain constitutive acts. (For a\nhelpful introduction to Butler\u2019s views, see Salih 2002.)\n\nFor Butler, sex assignment is always in some sense oppressive. Again,\nthis appears to be because of Butler\u2019s general suspicion of\nclassification: sex classification can never be merely descriptive but\nalways has a normative element reflecting evaluative claims of those\nwho are powerful. Conducting a feminist genealogy of the body (or\nexamining why sexed bodies are thought to come naturally as female and\nmale), then, should ground feminist practice (Butler 1993,\n28\u20139). Feminists should examine and uncover ways in which social\nconstruction and certain acts that constitute sex shape our\nunderstandings of sexed bodies, what kinds of meanings bodies acquire\nand which practices and illocutionary speech acts \u2018make\u2019\nour bodies into sexes. Doing so enables feminists to identity how\nsexed bodies are socially constructed in order to resist such\nconstruction.\n\nHowever, given what was said above, it is far from obvious what we\nshould make of Butler\u2019s claim that sex \u201cwas always already\ngender\u201d (1999, 11). Stone (2007) takes this to mean that sex\nis gender but goes on to question it arguing that the social\nconstruction of both sex and gender does not make sex identical to\ngender. According to Stone, it would be more accurate for Butler to\nsay that claims about sex imply gender norms. That is, many\nclaims about sex traits (like \u2018females are physically weaker\nthan males\u2019) actually carry implications about how women and men\nare expected to behave. To some extent the claim describes certain\nfacts. But, it also implies that females are not expected to do much\nheavy lifting and that they would probably not be good at it. So,\nclaims about sex are not identical to claims about gender; rather,\nthey imply claims about gender norms (Stone 2007, 70).\n",
