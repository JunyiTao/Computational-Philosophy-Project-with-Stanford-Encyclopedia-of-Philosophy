Animal Cognition of Absences\n\nSince Heidegger thinks that animals do not experience nothingness, he\nis committed to skepticism about animal reasoning involving negation.\nConsider the Stoic example of a dog that is following a trail. The dog\nreaches a fork in the road, sniffs at one road and then, without a\nfurther sniff, proceeds down the only remaining road. The Stoics took\nthis as evidence that the dog has performed a disjunctive syllogism:\n\u201cEither my quarry went down this road or that road.\nSniff\u2014he did not go down this road. Therefore, he went\ndown that road.\u201d Heidegger must discount this as\nanthropomorphism.\n\nMany biologists and psychologists side with the Stoic\u2019s emphasis\non our continuity with animals. They deny that human beings have a\nmonopoly on nothingness. A classic anomaly for the stimulus-response\nbehaviorist was the laboratory rat that responds to the absence of a\nstimulus:\n\nOne rather puzzling class of situations which elicit fear are those\nwhich consist of a lack of stimulation. Some members of this\nclass may be special instances of novelty. An anesthetised chimpanzee\ncould be described as a normal chimpanzee with the added novelty of\n\u2018no movement\u2019; solitude could be the novelty of \u2018no\ncompanions\u2019. This is not simply quibbling with words; for there\nis very good evidence (see Chapter 13) that the failure of a stimulus\nto occur at a point in time or space where it usually occurs acts like\nany other kind of novel stimulus. However, the intensity of the fear\nevoked by the sight of a dead or mutilated body is so much greater\nthan that evoked by more ordinary forms of novelty that we perhaps\nought to seek an alternative explanation of the effects of this\nstimulus. Fear of the dark is also difficult to account for in terms\nof novelty, since by the time this fear matures darkness is no less\nfamiliar than the light. (Gray 1987, 22)\n\n\nThese anomalies for behaviorism fill rationalists with mixed emotions.\nOn the one hand, the experiments refute the empiricist principle that\neverything known about the world is learned from experience. On the\nother hand, the experiments also constitute a caution against\nover-intellectualizing absences. A correct explanation of emotional\nengagement with absences must be more general and cognitively less\ndemanding than rationalists tend to presuppose. Even mosquito larvae\nsee shadows. Doubts about whether they have consciousness do not make\nus doubt that they see shadows. So the perception of absences cannot\ndepend on consciousness or any other advanced mental state. Perhaps\nthe earliest form of vision was of these absences of light. So instead\nof being a pinnacle of intellectual sophistication, cognition of\nabsences may be primal.\n\nExistentialists endorse the high standards assumed by rationalists.\nTheir disagreement with the rationalists is over whether the standards\nare met. The existentialists are disappointed by the contrast between\nour expectations of how reality ought to behave and how it in fact\nperforms.\n\nThis sense of absurdity makes existentialists more accepting of\nparadoxes than rationalists. Whereas rationalists nervously view\nparadoxes as a challenge to the authority of reason, existentialists\nwelcome them as opportunities to correct unrealistic hopes.\nExistentialists are fond of ironies and do not withdraw reflexively\nfrom the pain of contradiction. They Stoically introspect upon the\ninconsistency in the hope of achieving a resolution that does justice\nto the three dimensionality of deep philosophical problems. For\ninstance, Heidegger is sensitive to the hazards of saying that nothing\nexists. Like an electrician who must twist and bend a wire to make it\ntravel through an intricate hole, the metaphysician must twist and\nbend a sentence to probe deeply into the nature of being.\n\nRudolf Carnap thinks Heidegger\u2019s contorted sentences\nmalfunction. To illustrate, Carnap quotes snippets from\nHeidegger\u2019s What is Metaphysics?:\n\nWhat is to be investigated is being only and\u2014nothing else; being\nalone and further\u2014nothing; solely being, and beyond\nbeing-nothing. What about this Nothing? \u2026 Does the Nothing\nexist only because the Not, i.e. the Negation, exists? Or is it the\nother way around? Does Negation and the Not exist only because the\nNothing exists? \u2026 We assert: the Nothing is prior to the Not\nand the Negation\u2026. Where do we seek the Nothing? How do we find\nthe Nothing\u2026. We know the Nothing\u2026. Anxiety reveals the\nNothing\u2026. That for which and because of which we were anxious,\nwas \u2018really\u2019\u2014nothing. Indeed: the Nothing\nitself\u2014as such\u2014was present\u2026. What about this\nNothing?\u2014The Nothing itself nothings. (Heidegger as\n\u201cquoted\u201d by Carnap 1932, 69)\n\n\nThis paragraph, especially the last sentence, became notorious as a\nspecimen of metaphysical nonsense.\n\nThe confusion caused by Heidegger\u2019s linguistic contortions is\nexacerbated by separating them from their original text and herding\nthem into a crowded pen. There is a difference between a failure to\nunderstand and an understanding of failure. The real test for whether\nHeidegger\u2019s sentences are meaningless is to see what can be made\nof them in action, applied to the questions they were designed to\nanswer.\n\nCarnap also needs to consider the possibility that Heidegger\u2019s\nsentences are illuminating nonsense. After all, Carnap was patient\nwith the cryptic Wittgenstein. In the Tractatus, Wittgenstein\nspeaks like an oracle. He even characterized his carefully enumerated\nsentences as rungs in a ladder that must be cast away after we have\nmade the ascent and achieved an ineffable insight. And Wittgenstein\nmeant it, quitting philosophy to serve as a lowly schoolmaster in a\nrural village.\n\nOther critics deny that What is Metaphysics? suffers from an\nabsence of meaning. Just the reverse: they think Heidegger\u2019s\npassages about nothing involve too many meanings. When\nHeidegger connects negation with nothingness and death, these\nlogicians are put in mind of an epitaph that toys with the principle\nof excluded middle: Mrs Nott was Nott Alive and is Nott Dead.\nAccording to these critics, Heidegger\u2019s writings can only be\nunderstood in the way we understand the solution to equivocal\nriddles:\n\nWhat does a man love more than life?\n\nHate more than death or mortal strife?\n\nThat which contented men desire,\n\nThe poor have, the rich require,\n\nThe miser spends, the spendthrift saves,\n\nAnd all men carry to their graves?\n\n\n(Leeming, 1953, 201)\n\n\nThe answer, Nothing, can only be seen through a kaleidoscope\nof equivocations.\n\nSome of the attempts to answer \u2018Why is there something rather\nthan nothing?\u2019 equivocate or lapse into meaninglessness. The\ncomedic effect of such errors is magnified by the fundamentality of\nthe question. Error here comes off as pretentious error.\n\nThose who ask the question \u2018Why is there something rather than\nnothing?\u2019 commonly get confused. But the question itself appears\nto survive tests for being merely a verbal confusion.\n\nIn any case, the question (or pseudo-question) has helped to hone the\ndiagnostic tools that have been applied to it. As the issue gets\nshaped and re-shaped by advances in our understanding of\n\u2018is\u2019, quantification and explanatory standards, it becomes\nevident that the value of these diagnostic tools is not exhausted by\ntheir service in exposing pseudo-questions. For genuine questions\nbecome better understood when we can discriminate them from their\nspurious look-alikes.\n",
