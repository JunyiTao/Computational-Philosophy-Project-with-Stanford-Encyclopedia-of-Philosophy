This can be traced back to\nHamblin (1970, ch. 8) and Lorenzen\u2019s (1969) dialogue theory. The\npanacea for fallacies that Whately recommended was more logic;\nHamblin, however, proposed a shift from the logical to the dialectical\nperspective.\n\n[W]e need to extend the bounds of Formal Logic; to include features of\ndialectical contexts within which arguments are put forward. To begin\nwith, there are criteria of validity of argument that are additional\nto formal ones: for example, those that serve to proscribe\nquestion-begging. To go on with, there are prevalent but false\nconceptions of the rules of dialogue, which are capable of making\ncertain argumentative moves seem satisfactory and unobjectionable\nwhen, in fact, they conceal and facilitate dialectical malpractice.\n(Hamblin 1970, 254)\n\n\nThe proposal here is to shift the study of fallacies from the contexts\nof arguments to the contexts of dialogues (argumentation), formulate\nrules for reasonable dialogue activity, and then connect fallacies to\nfailures of rule-following. Barth and Martens\u2019s paper (1977),\nwhich studied the argumentum ad hominem by extending\nLorenzen\u2019s dialogue tableaux method to include the definitions\nof the concepts \u201cline of attack\u201d and \u201cwinning\nstrategy,\u201d leads to a conception of fallacies as either failures\nto meet one of the necessary conditions of rational dialogical\nargumentation, or failures to satisfy sufficient conditions as\nspecified by production rules of the dialogical method (1977, 96).\n\nThe Barth and Martens paper is a bridge between the earlier (quasi-)\nformal and subsequent informal dialectical theories, and is explicitly\nacknowledged as a major influence by the Pragma-dialectical theory,\nthe brainchild of Frans van Eemeren and Rob Grootendorst (1984).\nRather than beginning from a logical or epistemological perspective\nthey start with the role of argumentation in overcoming interpersonal\ndisagreements. The Pragma-dialecticians propose that inter-personal\nargumentation can be analysed as two-party-discussions having four\nanalytical stages: a confrontation stage in which the participants\nbecome aware of the content of their disagreement; an opening stage in\nwhich the parties agree (most likely implicitly) to shared starting\npoints and a set of rules to govern the ensuing discussion; an\nargumentation stage wherein arguments and doubts about arguments are\nexpressed and recognized; and a final stage in which a decision about\nthe initial disagreement is made, if possible, based on what happened\nin the argumentation stage.\n\nThe Pragma-dialectical theory stipulates a normative ideal of a\ncritical discussion which serves both as a guide to the\nreconstruction of natural language argumentation, as well as a\nstandard for the evaluation of the analysed product of reconstruction.\nA set of ten rules has been proposed as constitutive of the\ncritical-discussion ideal, and the proponents of the theory believe\nthat rational arguers would accept them. If followed by both parties\nto the disagreement, the rules constrain the argumentation decision\nprocedure such that any resolution reached will be deemed reasonable,\nand \u201cevery violation of any of the rules of the discussion\nprocedure for conducting a critical discussion\u201d will be a\nfallacy (2004, 175). The rules range over all the four stages of\nargumentation: at the confrontation stage there is a rule which says\none may not prevent the other party from expressing their view; for\nthe argumentation stage there is a rule which requires argumentation\nto be logically strong and in accord with one or another of three\ngeneral argumentation schemes; at the closing stage there is a rule\nthat the participants themselves are to decide which party was\nsuccessful based on the quality of the argumentation they have made:\nif the proponent carries the day, the opponent should acknowledge it,\nand vice versa.\n\nThe Pragma-dialectical theory proposes that each of the core fallacies\ncan be assigned a place as a violation of one of the rules of a\ncritical discussion. For example, the ad baculum fallacy is a\nform of intimidation that violates the rule that one may not attempt\nto prevent one\u2019s discussion partner from expressing their views;\nequivocation is a violation of the rule that formulations in arguments\nmust be clear and unambiguous; post hoc ergo propter hoc\nviolates the rule that arguments must be instances of schemes\ncorrectly applied. Moreover, on this theory, since any rule violation\nis to count as a fallacy this allows for the possibility that there\nmay be hitherto unrecognized \u201cnew fallacies.\u201d Among those\nproposed are declaring a standpoint sacrosanct because that\nbreaks the rule against the freedom to criticize points of view, and\nevading the burden of proof which breaks the rule that you\nmust defend your standpoint if asked to do so (see van Eemeren 2010,\n194).\n\nClearly not all the rules of critical discussions apply directly to\narguments. Some govern other goal-frustrating moves which arguers can\nmake in the course of settling a difference of opinion, such as\nmis-allocating the burden of proof, asking irrelevant questions,\nsuppressing a point of view, or failing to clarify the meaning of\none\u2019s argumentation. In short, the Pragma-dialectical rules of a\ncritical discussion are not just rules of logic or epistemology, but\nrules of conduct for rational discussants, making the theory more like\na moral code than a set of logical principles. Accordingly, this\napproach to fallacies rejects all three of the necessary conditions of\nSDF: a fallacy need not be an argument, thus the invalidity condition\nwill not apply either, and the appearance condition is excluded\nbecause of its subjective character (Van Eemeren and Grootendorst\n2004, 175).\n\nThe Pragma-dialectical analysis of fallacies as rule-breakings in a\nprocedure for overcoming disagreements has recently been expanded to\ntake account of the rhetorical dimension of argumentation.\nPragma-dialectics takes the rhetorical dimension to stem from an\narguer\u2019s wish to have their view accepted which leads dialoguers\nto engage in strategic maneuvering vis-\u00e0-vis their dialogue\npartners. However, this desire must be put in balance with the\ndialectical requirement of being reasonable; that is, staying within\nthe bounds of the normative demands of critical discussions. The ways\nof strategic maneuvering identified are basically three: topic\nselection, audience orientation, and the selection of presentational\ndevices, and these can be effectively deployed at each stage of\nargumentation (Van Eemeren 2010, 94). \u201cAll derailments of\nstrategic maneuvering are fallacies,\u201d writes van Eemeren (2010,\n198), \u201cin the sense that they violate one or more of the rules\nfor critical discussion and all fallacies can be viewed as derailments\nof strategic maneuvering.\u201d This means that all fallacies are\nultimately attributable to the rhetorical dimension of argumentation\nsince, in this model, strategic maneuvering is the entry of rhetoric\ninto argumentation discussions. \u201cBecause each fallacy has, in\nprinciple, sound counterparts that are manifestations of the same mode\nof strategic maneuvering\u201d it may not appear to be a fallacy and\nit \u201cmay pass unnoticed\u201d (Van Eemeren 2010, 199).\nNevertheless, Pragma-dialectics prefers to keep the appearance\ncondition outside the definition of \u2018fallacy\u2019, treating\nthe seeming goodness of fallacies as a sometime co-incidental\nproperty, rather than an essential one.\n\nArgumentation evaluation on the Pragma-dialectical approach is done\nwith an eye to a single ideal model of argumentation. This approach\nhas been challenged by Douglas Walton who has written more about\nfallacies and fallacy theory than anyone else. He has published\nindividual monographs on many of the well-known fallacies, among them,\nBegging the Question (1991), Slippery Slope\nArguments (1992), Ad Hominem Arguments (1998), and a\ncomprehensive work on fallacy theory, A Pragmatic Theory of\nFallacy (1995). Over the years his views have evolved. He has\nreferred to his theory as \u201cthe Pragmatic theory,\u201d and like\nthe Pragma-dialectical theory it has a dialectical/dialogical basis;\nhowever, Walton envisions a number of distinct normative dialectical\nframeworks (persuasion dialogue, inquiry dialogue, negotiation\ndialogue, etc.) rather than the single model of a critical discussion\nproposed by Pragma-dialectics. Postulating different kinds of\ndialogues with different starting points and different goals, thinks\nWalton, will bring argumentation into closer contact with\nargumentation reality. At one point Walton had the idea that fallacies\nhappened when there was an illicit shift from one kind of a dialogue\nto another (1995, 118\u201323), for example, using arguments\nappropriate for a negotiation dialogue in a persuasion dialogue, but\nmore recently he has turned to other ways of explicating\nfallacies.\n\nAlthough Walton recognizes the class of formal fallacies, his main\ninterest is in informal fallacies, especially the ones associated with\nargumentation schemes. The idea of an argumentation scheme is central\nto Walton\u2019s theory. Schemes are patterns of commonly used kinds\nof defeasible reasoning/argumentation such as appeals to expert\nopinion and ad hominem arguments. Schemes do not identify\nfallacies but rather argument kinds that are sometimes used fairly,\nand, other times, fallaciously. With each kind of scheme is associated\na set of critical questions which guide us in deciding whether a given\nuse of an argument is correct, weak or fallacious. So, if we\nconsider:\n\n\\(E\\) is an expert in subject area \\(S\\);\n\n\\(E\\) asserts \\(p\\) based on \\(E\\)\u2019s knowledge of \\(S\\);\n\nSo, \\(p\\).\n\nto be the scheme for the appeal-to-expertise kind of\n argument,[8]\n then there will be a question for each premise: Is \\(E\\) really an\nexpert in \\(S\\)? Did \\(E\\) say \\(p\\) when s/he was acting in her/his\nprofessional capacity? (\u2026 or did s/he blurt it out while drunk\nat an association party?). If the answer to both questions is Yes,\nthen the argument creates a presumption for the conclusion\u2014but\nnot a guarantee, for the reasoning is defeasible: other information\nmay come to light that will override the presumption. If one of the\nquestions cannot be answered clearly this is an indication that the\nargument is weak, and answering No to either of the two questions\ncancels the presumption for the conclusion, i.e., makes the argument\ninto a bad argument from expert opinion. If the bad argument has\n\u201ca semblance of correctness about it in [the] context, and poses\na serious obstacle to the realization of the goal of the\ndialog,\u201d then it is a fallacy (2011,\n 380).[9]\n\nThe definition of fallacy Walton proposes (1995, 255) has five parts.\nA fallacy:\n\nan argument (or at least something that purports to be an\nargument) that\nfalls short of some standard of correctness;\nis used in a context of dialogue;\nhas a semblance of correctness about it; and\nposes a serious problem to the realization of the goal of the\ndialogue.\n\n\nHere we find that Walton has relaxed two of the necessary conditions\nof SDF. Purporting to be an argument is enough (it doesn\u2019t\nreally have to be an argument), while falling short of a standard (one\nthat will vary with the kind of dialogue under consideration) replaces\nthe invalidity condition. However, the appearance condition, here\nexpressed as fallacies having a semblance of correctness about them,\nremains in full force. The two extra conditions added to fallacy are\nthat they occur only in contexts of dialogue and that they frustrate\nthe realization of the goal of the kind of dialogue in which they\noccur. In insisting on this dialogical dimension, Walton is in full\nsympathy with those who think that fallacies can only be rightly\nanalysed within a dialectical framework similar to the ones Aristotle\noriginally studied, and later better defined by Hamblin and Lorenzen.\nWalton volunteers a shorter version of the definition of a fallacy as\n\u201ca deceptively bad argument that impedes the progress of a\ndialogue\u201d (1995, 256).\n\nWalton divides fallacies into two kinds: paralogisms and sophisms. A\nparalogism is \u201cthe type of fallacy in which an error of\nreasoning is typically committed by failing to meet some necessary\nrequirement of an argumentation scheme\u201d whereas \u201cthe\nsophism type of fallacy is a sophistical tactic used to try to\nunfairly get the best of a speech partner in an exchange of\narguments\u201d (2010, 171; see also 1995, 254). Paralogisms are\ninstances of identifiable argumentation schemes, but sophisms are not.\nThe latter are associated more with infringing a reasonable\nexpectation of dialogue than with failing some standard of argument,\n(2011, 385; 2010, 175). A further distinction is drawn between\narguments used intentionally to deceive and arguments that merely\nbreak a maxim of argumentation unintentionally. The former count as\nfallacies; the latter, less condemnable, are blunders (1995, 235).\n\nAmong the informal paralogisms Walton includes: ad hominem,\nad populum, ad misericordiam, ad\nignorantiam, ad verecundiam, slippery slope, false\ncause, straw man, argument from consequences, faulty analogy,\ncomposition and division. In the category of sophisms he places ad\nbaculum, complex question, begging the question, hasty\ngeneralization, ignoratio elenchi, equivocation, amphiboly,\naccent, and secundum quid. He also has a class of formal\nfallacies very much the same as those identified by Whately and Copi.\nThe largest class in Walton\u2019s classification is the one\nassociated with argumentation schemes and ad-arguments, and\nthese are the ones that he considers to be the most central fallacies.\nNearly all the Aristotelian fallacies included find themselves\nrelegated to the less studied categories of sophisms. Taking a long\nlook at the history of fallacies, then, we find that the Aristotelian\nfallacies are no longer of central importance. They have been replaced\nby the fallacies associated with the ad-arguments.\n\nAnother recent approach comes from virtue argumentation theory\n(modelled on virtue epistemology). Virtue argumentation theory is\ncharacterized by a distinct set of virtues thought to be essential to\ngood argumentation: willingness to engage in argumentation,\nwillingness to listen to others and willingness to modify one\u2019s\nown position (see, e.g., Cohen 2009). These may be supplemented with\nepistemic virtues and even in some cases moral virtues. Although\nvirtues and vices are dispositions of arguers and fallacies are\narguments, it is claimed that good argumentation generally results\nfrom the influence of argumentation virtues and bad argumentation\n(including the fallacies) arise because of the vices of arguers. \n\nTaking the Aristotelian view that virtues are a mean between opposite\nkinds of vices, fallacious arguments can be seen as resulting from\narguers moving in one or another direction away from a mean of good\nargumentation. Aberdein (2013, 2016) especially has developed this\nmodel for understanding many of the fallacies. We can illustrate the\nview by considering appeals to expertise: the associated vices might\nbe too little respect for reliable authorities at one extreme and too\nmuch deference to authorities at the other extreme. Aberdein develops\nthe fallacies-as-argumentation-vices analysis in some detail for other\nof the ad-arguments and sketches how it might be applied to the other\ncore fallacies, suggesting it can profitably be extended to all of\nthem. \n\nAll the fallacies, it is claimed, can be fitted in somewhere in the\nclassification of argumentational vices, but the converse is not true\nalthough it is possible to bring to light other shortcomings to which\nwe may fall prey in argumentation. Another aspect of the theory is\nthat it distributes argumentation vices among both senders and\naudiences. Speakers may infect their arguments with vices when they\nare, for example, closed minded or lack respect for persons, and\naudiences can contribute to fallaciousness by letting their\nreceptivity be influenced by na\u00efvety, an over-reliance on common\nsense, or an unfounded bias against a speaker. Perhaps the development\nof the virtue argumentation theory approach to fallacies provides a\nsupplement to Mill\u2019s theory of fallacies. He distinguished\n(1891, V, i, 3) what he called the moral (dispositional) and\nintellectual causes of fallacy. The study of the argumentative vices\nenvisioned above seems best included under the moral study of\nfallacies as the vices can be taken to be the presdisposing causes to\ncommit intellectual mistakes, i.e., misevaluations of the weight of\nevidence. \n",
