Reinach observes that, while the division of\nnumbers into two sorts, the ordinal and the cardinal, is generally\naccepted, it is widely debated which kind of number is more primitive\nor basic. Reinach attempts to resolve this debate, and in the process\nprovides an account of number predications, such as \u201cThe\nKaiser's coach is drawn by four horses,\u201d of a sort treated also\nby Frege. He begins by noting that cardinal numbers are properly\nspeaking not predicated of things. Frege, for example, argued that in\nstatements such as \u201cThe Kaiser's coach is drawn by four\nhorses\u201d the number four is predicated of a concept, namely,\nhorse that draws the Kaiser's coach. However, Reinach finds\nit to be self-evident that \u201ca concept which subsumes four\nobjects is just as little four as a concept which subsumes material\nobjects is, therefore, itself material\u201d (p. 206). Neither\nnumbers nor categorical elements such as \u201csome\u201d or\n\u201call\u201d are properties, by this argument, and accordingly\nthey are not really predicated of things. Numbers rather give the\nrange of objects that fall within the scope of a predication. Put\nanother way, numbers do not answer the question \u201chow many\u201d\nbut rather \u201chow many\nAs are B?\u201d\n\n\nReinach finds that so-called ordinal numbers are nothing but a\nshorthand way of referring to the (cardinal) number of terms a certain\nseries contains up to some given term. In any given series, we have a\nfirst term, a last term, and any number of terms in\nbetween. Naturally, we may wish to denote the position of a term\nwithin an ordered series.  Yet this can quickly become very\ncumbersome. As Reinach notes, if we use letters to denote an ordered\nseries of four terms\u2014a, b, c, and\nd\u2014then already \u201cc\u201d would be called\n\u201cthe term following the term following the opening term.\u201d\nIt is much easier simply to adopt a numerical convention according to\nwhich \u201cc\u201d is named in reflection of the fact that\nit is the term up to which the series contains three terms. Yet in no\nway does such designation constitute a new sort of number; in saying\nthe series \u2018contains three members up to this point\u2019, we\nare still making use of the cardinal number three. Reinach writes that\nthere is\n\n\nno peculiarity of series terms as such, nothing\nnumerical\u2014which might be grasped by us. The elements have their\npositions in the series, and these positions can be defined by the\nsuccessor's relation to the opening term. Nothing is said of\nnumber. \u2026 there are no ordinal numbers. Philosophy has\npossibly been flustered here because it blindly followed the\nsign-makings of the mathematicians, and thereby took words for facts.\n(p. 208)\n\n\nReinach's view of ordinal numbers may seem radical. However,\nit is not only internally consistent with his philosophy of ideal\nobjects and predication, but it seems consistent also with ordinary\nlanguage. As Reinach observes, the way that we designate the position\nof elements in a series does not always use numerical names:\n\n\nthe first is not the onest [einste]. \u2026 Also, the\nterm following the first need not be designated with the aid of a\nnumber. We, indeed, say \u201czweite,\u201d but the Latin\nsays \u201csecundus.\u201d So not all ordinal designations are\nordinal number-designations.\n",
