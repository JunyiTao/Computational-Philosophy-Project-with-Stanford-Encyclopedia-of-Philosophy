    "main_text": "Perfectionism in Politics || The Harm Principle\n3.4 The Harm Principle\n\n\nThose who reject the principle of state neutrality entrust the state\nwith the task of promoting the good. This can give rise to the worry\nthat a perfectionist account of politics is insufficiently sensitive to\nthe harm of coercion and to the value of liberty. If the state need not\nbe neutral among rival understandings of the good, then is the door not\nopen for the coercive imposition of state policies designed to promote\nthe good? In fact, many versions of perfectionism drawn from the\nhistory of political thought have paid little heed to the value of\nindividual liberty. It is an important matter, then, to what extent\nperfectionist politics can be reconciled with a proper regard for\nindividual liberty.\n\n\nTo approach this issue, it will be helpful to consider the so called\nharm principle. The harm principle, as articulated by writers in the\nliberal political tradition from Mill to Feinberg, is often taken to\nbe an essential safeguard for individual freedom in political\nsociety. At least at first pass, the harm principle substantially\nrestricts the power of governments to promote the good. It holds that\ngovernments cannot coercively interfere with persons unless doing so\nis necessary to prevent them from causing clear and direct harm to\nothers. The harm principle requires interpretation and can be\nunderstood in different ways. But for present purposes our question is\nwhether the harm principle is best understood to be an\nanti-perfectionist principle\u2014a principle that provides reasons\nfor rejecting or limiting perfectionist politics.\n\n\nThe first thing to say is that not all perfectionist policies are\ncoercive. Governments can and do promote the good noncoercively. A\ngovernment may promote the good, for example, when it intelligently\nsubsidizes art. This perfectionist policy need involve no coercive\ninterference\n whatsoever.[14]\nSo the harm principle, even if sound, would\nnot bar all perfectionist policies. It would rule out only coercive\ngovernmental policies designed to favor some options and discourage\nothers. The question then is whether this restriction is itself\nanti-perfectionist.\n\n\nHere we need to proceed with caution. The extent to which\nperfectionism licenses the coercive promotion of the good depends,\namong other things, on the degree to which autonomy or liberty is\nitself recognized to be a perfectionist good. On some versions of\nperfectionism the harm principle would be an anti-perfectionist\nprinciple, while on others it would not be. Consider, in this\nregard, Mill\u2019s own defense of the harm principle. For Mill\n\u201cindividuality\u201d is an essential component of a good human\nlife. Mill\u2019s notion of individuality can be understood to be a\nconception of autonomy. A person is autonomous for Mill if he leads his\nlife on his own terms and develops his capacities and faculties\naccording to \u201chis own mode of laying out his existence\u201d\n(Mill 1859, 64). The important point for present purposes is not Mill\u2019s\nparticular characterization of autonomy, but rather the structure of\nhis view. Autonomy is understood to be an essential aspect of a good\nhuman life, not a separate norm. And the value of autonomy explains, at\nleast in part, why Mill recommends the harm principle.\n\n\nThe Millian defense of the harm principle sits well with the\nperfectionist focus on good human lives. (Brink 2013) Its availability nicely\nillustrates how perfectionist politics can be consistent with a strong\nrejection of state coercion. But it is natural to suspect that\nMill overstates his case. Even granting that\n\u201cindividuality\u201d is an aspect of a good human life, we\nshould wonder why it takes priority over all other aspects. If a\ngovernmental policy, say a policy that criminalizes the sale and use of\ndangerous recreational drugs, would prevent many from ruining their\nlives while infringing the individuality of only a few, then, contrary\nto Mill, the government may do better in discharging its duty to\npromote good human lives by adopting the policy than by not adopting\nit.\n\n\nThis point can be pushed further. Autonomy, it can be argued,\nrequires that one have access to an adequate range of valuable or\nworthwhile options (Raz 1986). This adequacy requirement does not imply\nthat every time an option is closed off one\u2019s autonomy will be set\nback. Moreover, what may be of value is not autonomous agency per se,\nbut valuable autonomous agency. Joseph Raz explains: \u201cSince our\nconcern for autonomy is a concern to enable people to have a good life\nit furnishes us with reason to secure that autonomy which could be\nvaluable. Providing, preserving or protecting bad options does not\nenable one to enjoy valuable autonomy\u201d (Raz 1986, 412). If\nvaluable autonomy, and not autonomy per se, is what has perfectionist\nvalue, then when governments eliminate, or make it more costly for\npersons to pursue, worthless options, then they may do no perfectionist\nharm and much perfectionist good.\n\n\nOn Raz\u2019s view, the harm principle is superseded by an autonomy\nprinciple that captures the truth in it while avoiding its\nexaggerations. The autonomy principle holds that the state has negative\nduties to respect the autonomy of its citizens as well as positive\nduties to promote and sustain social conditions that contribute to its\nrealization. The harm principle, to the extent that it is sound, is\nvindicated because it follows, given certain contingent facts, from the\nautonomy principle. This leads Raz to reformulate the harm principle as\na principle \u201cthat regards the prevention of harm to anyone\n(himself included) as the only justifiable ground for coercive\ninterference with a person\u201d (Raz 1986, 412\u201313). So construed, the\nharm principle would permit the coercive enforcement of at least some\nself-regarding duties.\n\n\nBoth Mill and Raz accept versions of the harm principle. But they\naccept it not as a limit on perfectionist politics, but rather as a\nprinciple that guides the proper promotion of the good. Their political\ntheories are examples of perfectionist liberalism and their discussions\nof the harm principle show how perfectionist politics can be supportive\nof individual liberty. It can be objected, however, that the defense of\nindividual liberty provided by perfectionist liberalism is\ninsufficient. Recall that on the perfectionist view discussed here\nautonomy is an aspect of a good human life. It is not a separate norm.\nA strong and uncompromising defense of the harm principle, it may be\nthought, must be based on a different understanding of the value of\nautonomy, one that holds that the autonomy of persons cannot be\ninfringed even when doing so is, all things considered, in their best\ninterests. Autonomy, on this view, is a sovereign right, not an ideal\nto be promoted (Feinberg 1989). The nature and plausibility of this\nalternative view of autonomy, however, are not matters that can be\ntaken up\n here.[15]\n",
