    "main_text": "The Concept of Progress || Progress and Rationality\n2.5 Progress and Rationality\n\nSome philosophers use the concepts of progress and rationality as\nsynonyms: progressive steps in science are precisely those that are\nbased upon the scientists\u2019 rational choices. One possible\nobjection is that scientific discoveries are progressive when they\nintroduce novel ideas, even though they cannot be fully explained in\nrational terms (Popper 1959; cf. Hanson 1958; Kleiner 1993). However,\nanother problem is more relevant here: By whose lights should such\nsteps be evaluated? This question is urgent especially if we\nacknowledge that standards of good science have changed in history\n(Laudan 1984a). \n\nAs we shall see, the main rival philosophical theories of progress\npropose absolute criteria, such as problem-solving capacity\nor increasing truthlikeness, that are applicable to all developments\nof science throughout its history. On the other hand, rationality is a\nmethodological concept which is historically relative: in\nassessing the rationality of the choices made by the past scientists,\nwe have to study the aims, standards, methods, alternative theories\nand available evidence accepted within the scientific community at\nthat time (cf. Doppelt, 1983, Laudan, 1987; Niiniluoto 1999a). If the\nscientific community \\(SC\\) at a given point of time \\(t\\) accepted\nthe standards \\(V\\), then the preference of \\(SC\\) for theory \\(T\\)\nover \\(T'\\) on evidence \\(e\\) was rational just in case the\nepistemic utility of \\(T\\) relative to \\(V\\) was higher than that of\n\\(T'\\). But in a new situation, where the standards were different\nfrom \\(V\\), a different preference might have been rational. \n",
