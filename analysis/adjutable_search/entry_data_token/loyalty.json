Introduction\n1.1 Background\n\nMost of the detailed engagement with loyalty has come from creative\nwriters (Aeschylus, 2003; Galsworthy, 1922; Conrad, 1899, 1907, 1913),\nbusiness and marketing scholars (Goman, 1990; Jacoby & Chestnut,\n1978), psychologists (Zdaniuk & Levine, 2001), psychiatrists\n(B\u00f6sz\u00f6rm\u00e9nyi-Nagy, 1973), sociologists (Connor,\n2007), scholars of religion (Sakenfeld, 1985; Spiegel, 1965),\npolitical economists (Hirschman, 1970, 1974),\nand\u2014pre-eminently\u2014political theorists who took a\nparticular interest in nationalism, patriotism and loyalty oaths\n(Grodzins, 1956; Schaar, 1957; Guetzkow, 1955). Because of its focus\non familial relations, Confucian thought has long been interested in\nloyalty (Goldin, 2008; see also the section on\n  Filiality and Care \n in the entry on Chinese Ethics for more on loyalty and related\ndebates in Confucian and Mohist ethics). The grand Western\nphilosophical exception has been Josiah Royce (1908, 1913), who,\ninfluenced by eastern philosophy (Foust, 2012b, 2015), created an\nethical theory centering on \u201cloyalty to loyalty.\u201d Royce\nhas generated a steady but specialized interest (see, esp. Foust,\n2012a, 2011, forthcoming). Since the 1980s, though, some\nindependent philosophical discussion has begun to emerge (Baron, 1984;\nFletcher, 1993; Oldenquist, 1982; MacIntyre, 1984; Nuyen, 1999;\nKeller, 2007; Jollimore, 2012; Felten, 2012; Kleinig, 2014), not only\ngenerally and in the context of political theory, but also in the\nareas of occupational and professional ethics (McChrystal, 1992, 1998;\nTrotter, 1997; Hajdin, 2005; Hart & Thompson, 2007; Schrag, 2001;\nColeman, 2009; Foust, 2018), whistleblowing (Martin, 1992; Varelius,\n2009), friendship (Bennett, 2004), and virtue theory (Ewin, 1992).\n1.2 Roots\n\nAlthough the term \u201cloyalty\u201d has its immediate philological\norigins in Old French, its older and mostly abandoned linguistic roots\nare in the Latin lex (law). Nevertheless, dimensions of the\nphenomenon that we now recognize as loyalty are as ancient as human\nassociation, albeit often manifested in its breaches (disloyalty,\nbetrayal). The Old Testament writers were often occupied with the\nfickleness of human commitments, whether to God or to each other. To\ncharacterize such fickleness they tended to use the language of\n(un)faithfulness, though nowadays we might be inclined to use the more\nrestricted language of (in)fidelity, which has regard to specific\ncommitments. In medieval to early modern uses of the term, loyalty\ncame to be affirmed primarily in the oath or pledge of fealty or\nallegiance sworn by a vassal to his lord. That had an interesting\noffshoot as monarchical feudalism lost sway: loyal subjects who were\ndistressed by the venality of sitting sovereigns found it\nnecessary\u2014as part of their effort to avoid charges of\ntreason\u2014to distinguish their ongoing loyalty to the institution\nof kingship from their loyalty to a particular king.\n2. The nature of loyalty\n\nAs a working definition, loyalty can be characterized as a practical\ndisposition to persist in an intrinsically valued (though not\nnecessarily valuable) associational attachment, where that involves a\npotentially costly commitment to secure or at least not to jeopardize\nthe interests or well-being of the object of loyalty. For the most\npart, an association that we come to value for its own sake is also\none with which we come to identify (as mine or\nours).\n2.1 A practical disposition or only a sentiment?\n\nThe nature of loyal attachment is a matter of debate. The strong\nfeelings and devotion often associated with loyalty have led some to\nassert that loyalty is only or primarily a feeling or\nsentiment\u2014an affective bondedness that may express itself in\ndeeds, the latter more as an epiphenomenon than as its core. As Ewin\nput it, loyalty is an \u201cinstinct to sociability\u201d (Ewin,\n1990, 4; cf. Connor, 2007). But feelings of loyalty are probably not\nconstitutive of loyalty, even if it is unusual to find loyalties that\nare affectless. Arguably, the test of loyalty is conduct rather than\nintensity of feeling, primarily a certain \u201cstickingness\u201d\nor perseverance\u2014the loyal person acts for or stays with or\nremains committed to the object of loyalty even when it is likely to\nbe disadvantageous or costly to the loyal person to remain so.\n\nThose who focus on loyalty as a sentiment often intend to deny that\nloyalty might be rationally motivated. But even though expressions of\nloyalty may not be maximizing (in cost-benefit terms), the decision to\ncommit oneself loyally may be rational, for one need not (indeed,\nought not to) enter into associations blindly, or\u2014even when they\nare initially unavoidable (as with familial or national\nones)\u2014accept their demands unthinkingly. Moreover, once made,\nsuch commitments may be forfeited by the objects of loyalty should\nthere be serious failure on their part, or they may be overridden in\nthe face of significantly greater claims. One loyalty may trump\nanother; other values may trump loyalty.\n\nUnsentimental loyalties, such as the zealous but unsentimental\nprofessional loyalty of a lawyer to a client, are not unthinking, but\nhave their rationale in professional or associational tele,\nsuch as that of the adversarial system (however, see McChrystal, 1992,\n1998). It is to this shared professional commitment that the lawyer is\nultimately committed, not as a matter of mere sentiment but of\ndeliberative choice.\n\nPosing the issue as one of either \u201cpractical disposition\u201d\nor \u201csentiment\u201d is probably too stark. Some evolutionary\nbiologists/psychologists see loyalty as a genetically transmitted\nadaptive mechanism, a felt attachment to others that has survival\nvalue (Wilson, 1993, 23). Given what is often seen as the\nself-sacrificial character of individual loyalty, such loyalty is\ntaken to be directed primarily to group survival (West, 1945, 218).\nBut it is not clear what any such explanatory account shows. What\n\u201cloyalty\u201d may have begun as (defense of the group against\nthreat) and what it has come to be for reflective beings need not be\nthe same. Nor would it impugn what loyalty has come to be that it\nbegan as a survival mechanism (presuming an adaptive account to be\ncorrect).\n3. The structure of loyalty\n3.1 Loyalty and loyalties\n\nSometimes we use \u201cloyalty\u201d to refer to the practical\ndisposition to persevere in affiliational attachments. More commonly\nwe speak of loyalties to specific associations. Our generic\ndisposition to be loyal is expressed in loyalties to certain\nkinds of natural or conventional associations, such as friendships,\nfamilies, organizations, professions, countries, and religions. There\nis a reason for this. Associations that evoke and exact our loyalty\ntend to be those with which we have become deeply involved or\nidentified. This is implicit in the working\ndefinition\u2019s reference to \u201cintrinsically valued\nassociational attachments.\u201d Intrinsically valued associational\nattachments are usually those with which we have developed some form\nof social identification. We have come to value the associational bond\nfor its own sake (whatever may have originally motivated it). Our\nloyalties are not just to any groups that may exist, or even to any\ngroup with which we have some association, but only to those to which\nwe are sufficiently closely bound to call ours. My loyalties\nare to my friends, my family, my\nprofession, or our country, not yours, unless yours are also\nmine. In such identifications, the fate or well-being of the objects\nof loyalty become bound up with one\u2019s own. We feel shame or\npride in their doings. We will take extra risks or bear special\nburdens for them.\n\nAlthough our primary loyalties tend to be to associations or groupings\nthat are socially valued, such that loyalty may seem to be an\nimportant practical disposition, this need not be the case. For in\ntheory, any association can become intrinsically important to us,\nwhether or not it is generally valued, and it may do so even if it is\nsocially despised. Gangs and crime families, may become objects of\nloyalty no less than professional associations and siblings.\n3.2 Is loyalty inherently exclusionary?\n\nIt has sometimes been suggested that \u201cA can be loyal to\nB only if there is a third party C \u2026 who\nstands as a potential competitor to B\u201d (Fletcher, 1993,\n8). It is true that many, if not most, expressions of loyalty occur\nagainst the background of some challenge to B\u2019s\ninterests whose protection by A will be at some cost to\nA. Failures of loyalty often result in betrayal (of\nB, sometimes to C). Thus, defending\none\u2019s spouse in the face of criticism may also subject oneself\nto vilification (by C); refusing to leave one\u2019s\nuniversity for another (C) may involve a sacrifice of pay and\nother opportunities; and patriotic loyalty may involve volunteering\nfor military service when one\u2019s country is attacked (by\nC). Sometimes, however, the loyal friend will simply manifest\nthe loyalty by being responsive to B\u2019s need at some\ninconvenience. The loyal A will get up at 2.00am to fetch\nB when B\u2019s car has broken down or will agree\nto be best man at B\u2019s wedding even though it will\ninvolve a long flight and great expense. No third party is involved,\nbut there will be a cost to A. The incentive to disloyalty is\nmore likely to be found in the blandishments of self-interest or\nself-maximization than in external temptations to side with a\ncompetitor\u2019s interests (Kleinig, forthcoming).\n\nSome defenders as well as critics of loyalty take the frequent\npresence of C as a reason for seeing loyalty as inherently\nunfriendly. To put it in the words of the political consultant, James\nCarville, \u201csticking with\u201d B requires\n\u201csticking it to\u201d C (Carville, 2000). No doubt\nsome loyalties\u2014especially political ones\u2014frequently\nexpress themselves in such terms. But jingoism is not necessary to\npatriotic loyalty (pace Tolstoy, 1894), and in most contexts\nthe privileging of an object of loyalty (B) does not require\ntreating others (C) badly. Loyalty to one\u2019s own\nchildren need not involve the disparagement of others\u2019\nchildren.\n3.3 Universalism and particularism\n\nLoyalty is generally seen as involving particularistic, or special,\nobligations to the individual or groups to whom one is loyal and thus\nas a particularistic virtue (as contrasted with, say, the virtue of\nhonesty, which is to be exercized toward all). Although Royce elevated\n\u201cloyalty to loyalty\u201d into a universalistic principle,\nthere has been much debate concerning the relation between\nparticularistic obligations, such as those associated with loyalty and\ngratitude (McConnell, 1983), and universalistic, or general,\nobligations owed to all by virtue of their humanity. Are\nparticularistic obligations subsumable under universalistic ones or\nare they independently derived? If the latter, do they stand in\npermanent tension (obligations to the poor vs. obligations to\none\u2019s children)? How, if at all, are conflicts to be resolved?\nThe discussion has its modern roots in Enlightenment ideas of equal\nrespect and of what is therefore owed to all by virtue of their common\nhumanity. Both consequentialism and Kantian universalism have some\ndifficulty in accommodating virtues such as loyalty, and on occasion\nhave eschewed the latter. As the consequentialist William Godwin\nnotoriously asked: \u201cWhat magic is there in the pronoun\n\u2018my,\u2019 that should justify us in overturning the decisions\nof impartial truth?\u201d (Godwin, 1946, vol. 1, 127).\n\nAlthough most classical theorists have tended to accord moral priority\nto universalistic obligations, there have been important exceptions.\nAndrew Oldenquist has argued for the primacy of certain communal\ndomains defined by our loyalties (\u201call morality is tribal\nmorality\u201d), within which considerations of impartiality may\noperate: \u201cour wide and narrow loyalties define moral communities\nor domains within which we are willing to universalize moral\njudgments, treat equals equally, protect the common good, and in other\nways adopt the familiar machinery of impersonal morality\u201d\n(Oldenquist, 1982, 178, 177; cf. MacIntyre, 1984). Although Oldenquist\ndenies that there is a nontribal, universalist morality, thus seeking\nto deprive the universalist of any independent traction, he does not\ndo much to establish the primacy of the tribal apart, perhaps, from a\ncertain temporal developmental priority.\n\nBernard Williams argued that if the claims of universalism (whether of\nthe consequentialist or Kantian kind) are given pre-eminence, they\nwill alienate people from their \u201cground projects,\u201d where\nthe latter include the deep attachments associated with loyalties.\nWilliams obviously has a point, though even he conceded that such\nprojects are not impervious to universalistic challenges (Williams,\n1981, 17\u201318).\n\nMany systematic moral theorists attempt to subsume particularistic\nobligations such as loyalty under larger universalistic obligations.\nR.M. Hare, for example, adopted a two-tiered consequentialist position\nthat seeks to justify the particularistic obligations of loyalty\nwithin a broader consequentialist schema: we contribute more\neffectively to overall well-being if we foster particularistic\nobligations. Reflecting on the particularism of mother love and\nloyalty, he writes: \u201cIf mothers had the propensity to care\nequally for all the children in the world, it is unlikely that\nchildren would be as well provided for even as they are. The dilution\nof the responsibility would weaken it out of existence\u201d (Hare,\n1981, 137). Unfortunately, simply being aware of the general\nobligation may be sufficient to evacuate the particularistic\nobligation of much of its power\u2014and, indeed, to call it into\nquestion. Moreover, it may overlook the distinctive source of the\nparticularistic obligation\u2014not in the needs of children so much\nas in their being one\u2019s own.\n\nPeter Railton has attempted to find a place for loyalties within a\nbroadly consequentialist framework that avoids both alienation and the\nproblems confronting Hare\u2019s two-tiered system. According to\nRailton, there are good consequentialist reasons for acting on\nparticularistic preferences, consequentialist reasons that do not\nundercut but honor the particularism of those preferences.\nRailton\u2019s defense trades on a distinction between subjective and\nobjective consequentialism, the objective consequentialist (whom he\nsupports) being committed to the course of action available to an\nagent that would maximize the good (Railton, 1984, 152). That, he\nbelieves, does not require that the agent consciously decide to\nmaximize the good\u2014indeed, it may require that the agent not make\nsuch calculations. Overall, then, a loyalty to friends and family, and\ncommitment to ground projects may maximize good, even though, were one\nto make a subjective calculation, it would undermine the loyalty or\ncommitment. Although there is some debate about the success of this\nstrategy (Wilcox, 1987; Conee, 2001), it goes some way to countering\nthe common perception that universalistic (or impersonal) theories can\nfind no place for particularist obligations.\n\nAnother two-tiered system, but of a nonconsequentialist variety, is\nsuggested by Alan Gewirth (1988), who accords primacy to the principle\nthat it is a necessary condition for human agency that all be accorded\nequal rights to freedom and well-being. That commitment, he believes,\nwill also be sufficient to ground special obligations such as those\nfinding expression in personal, familial, and national loyalties. It\nserves as such a ground because the commitment to individual freedom\npermits the formation of voluntary associations, including\n\u201cexclusive\u201d ones, as long as they do not interfere with\nothers\u2019 basic freedom. Such voluntary associations are formed\nnot merely for instrumental purposes, as contributions to our freedom,\nbut are expressive of it. A persisting problem for this account\nconcerns the resolution of conflicts between obligations that arise\nout of our associational commitments (say, to our families) and those\nthat arise directly out of the general principle (say, to assist the\nworld\u2019s needy). This is of course a general problem, and not\njust one for Gewirth; but it raises a question about the success of\nGewirth\u2019s distinctive project, which was to develop a systematic\nalternative to the moral pluralism that he associates with Isaiah\nBerlin, Michael Walzer, and Thomas Nagel.\n\nIt may be that particularistic obligations such as those of loyalty\nhave to be considered as sui generis, products not simply of our\ncommon humanity but of our sociality, of the self-realizing\nsignificance of associational bonds\u2014most particularly\nfriendships, but also various other associational connections that\ncome to be constitutive of our identity and ingredients in our\nflourishing. That leaves, of course, the problem of resolving\nconflicts with universalistic obligations when they occur. We may,\nwith Scheffler, wish to argue that the reasons generated by\nparticularistic associations are \u201cpresumptively decisive\u201d\nin cases in which conflict arises (Scheffler, 1997, 196), though that\nwould need to be integrated in some way with judgments about the value\nto be attributed to particular associations.\n3.4 The subjects of loyalty\n\nIndividual persons are typically the one\u2019s who are loyal (i.e.,\nthe subjects of loyalty), but being loyal is not restricted to\nindividual persons. Mutuality is a feature of many loyalties, and it\nis often a normative expectation of the loyal individual that the\ncollectivity to which the individual is loyal will also be loyal in\nreturn (Ogunyemi, 2014). Just as we personify organizations, regarding\nthem as in some sense responsible actors, so we can attribute loyalty\nto them or\u2014more often\u2014 bemoan their lack of loyalty to\nthose who have been loyal to them.\n\nMay animals be loyal? Tales of canine loyalty are legion, and even\namong wild animals, especially those that move in social groups,\nloyalty is often said to be shown. To the extent that loyalty is seen\nas an adaptive sentiment, we may think that animals are capable of\nloyalty. That may be a convenient way of characterizing animal\nbehavior (what Aristotle refers to as a \u201cnatural\u201d virtue),\nthough, as Fletcher observes, the kind of loyalty shown is limited\nbecause such loyalty cannot be betrayed. The dog who is distracted by\nthe burglar\u2019s steak does not betray its owner; its training has\nsimply been inadequate. It is also limited because it is the kind of\nloyalty that, if displayed by humans, would be characterized as\n\u201cblind\u201d and therefore likely to expose one to moral peril\n(Blamires, 1963, 24).\n3.5 The objects of loyalty\n\nAs noted, the primary objects of loyalty tend to be persons, personal\ncollectivities (such as families), or quasi-persons such as\norganizations (the company for which one works) or social groups\n(one\u2019s church congregation). Some argue that it is only to such\nthat we can be loyal (Ladd, 1967; Baron, 1984). But that is at odds\nwith the view that almost \u201canything to which one\u2019s heart\ncan become attached or devoted\u201d may also become an object of\nloyalty\u2014principles, causes, brands, ideas, ideals, and\nideologies (Konvitz, 1973, 108). Royce himself argued that loyalty is\nthe \u201cwilling and practical and thoroughgoing devotion of a\nperson to a cause\u201d (Royce, 1908, 16\u201317). In response,\nthose who personalize the objects of loyalty point out that we have\nequally available to us the language of commitment or devotion and, in\nthe case of what is spoken of as \u201cloyalty to one\u2019s\nprinciples,\u201d we have the language of integrity.\n\nThere is some reason to favor the more restrictive focus for loyalty.\nOur core loyalties, which also happen to be those that are\npsychologically more powerful (Walzer, 1970, 5), tend to secure the\nviability and sometimes the integrity of our particular human\nassociations. To the extent that our moral obligations encompass not\nonly our relations with other human beings in general but also our\nrelationships with particular others\u2014our friends, families,\nfellow citizens, and so on\u2014loyalty will be partially\nconstitutive and sustaining of these particular others in contexts in\nwhich narrow or short-term self-interest is likely to be better served\nby abandoning them. If we further argue that the core of morality is\nconcerned with the quality of relationships that people have with each\nother, both as fellow humans and in the various associative groups\nthat they form, then loyalty will constitute an important dimension of\nthat relational network. Even the \u201ccause\u201d with which Royce\nassociates loyalty is ultimately articulated in terms of devotion to a\ncommunity (Royce, 1908, 20; 1913, vol. 1, xvii). Although the\nobject of loyalty is another individual or association, not a cause,\nvalue, or ideal, there is, nevertheless, an important connection\nbetween our loyalties to individuals and groups, and the causes,\nvalues, and ideals to which we subscribe. In identifying with the\nobject of our loyalty, there is usually implicit in our\nloyalty a judgment that its object meshes with that for which we\nstand. That is, embedded in those associations to which our loyalty is\ngiven are certain presumptions about the compatibility of the basic\nvalues attributable to the object of loyalty with those to which we\nare committed (not that the values themselves are what ground the\nloyalty, for that might suggest that the loyalty is to the values). To\nthe extent that we discover it to be otherwise we have a reason for\ntaking some action\u2014either to try to bring about a change in the\nobject of our loyalty (what Albert Hirschman [1970] calls giving\nvoice) or to abandon it (Hirschman\u2019s exit option) on the ground\nthat it has forfeited its claim to our loyalty. There may, of course,\nbe some sort of persistence of loyalty despite a recognition that the\nobject of loyalty is no longer worthy of it. In such cases, the\nloyalty seems to ride on some commitment to an associational ideal\n(\u201cHe will always be our son.\u201d).\n\n\nIn theory, nothing prevents the \u201cpersonal\u201d object of\nloyalty being the whole human race (pace Ladd, 1967). A\nuniversalist particularism can be found in some environmental\ncontexts, when the future of humanity is up for consideration,\nor\u2014as it was nicely illustrated in Mary Shelley\u2019s\nFrankenstein\u2014when Victor Frankenstein decided not to\njeopardize the human race by creating a companion for his monster\n(Shelley, 1831 [1957, 187]). In contexts in which the human race can itself\nbe viewed as a collectivity, loyalty to it may be\nattributed\u2014though that may sometimes generate charges of\nspeciesism (Bernstein, 1991).\n4. Loyalty as a virtue\n\nMark Twain (1935) and Graham Greene (\u201cthe virtue of\ndisloyalty,\u201d 1973) notwithstanding, there is greater agreement\nthat disloyalty is a vice than that loyalty is a virtue (Kleinig,\nforthcoming). Perhaps the frequency with which the demand for\nloyalty is used to \u201cjustify\u201d engagement in unethical\nconduct has led to cynicism about its value. There is a certain\nresonance to the saying that \u201cwhen an organization wants you to\ndo right, it asks for your integrity; when it wants you to do wrong,\nit demands your loyalty.\u201d What might it be about loyalty that\nmakes it vulnerable to such uses?\n\nThere are those who, on the basis of their particular theory of\nvirtue, deny that loyalty could be a virtue. R.E. Ewin, for example,\nargued that because loyalty can be badly placed (as in the case of the\nloyal Nazi) and because, once formed, it requires us not merely to\nsuspend our own judgment about its object but even to set aside good\njudgment (Ewin, 1992, 403, 411), its pretensions to the status of a\nvirtue are undermined, for the virtues are, he argued, internally\nlinked to some idea of good judgment. The worth of any particular\nloyalty is thus reducible to judgments about the worth of the\nassociations to which loyalty is given or the legitimacy of what is\ndone as a result of them and is not due to loyalty in general being a\nvirtue.\n\nThere are two problems with this account. First, the understanding of\nthe virtues may be thought too restrictive. As with loyalty,\nconscientiousness and sincerity can be directed to unworthy objects,\nbut conscientiousness and sincerity do not for that reason fail as\nvirtues. It is arguable that had Ewin given consideration to the view\nthat virtues operate, as Philippa Foot puts it, \u201cat a point at\nwhich there is some temptation to be resisted or deficiency of\nmotivation to be made good\u201d (Foot, 1978, 8)\u2014he might have\nbeen able to accommodate them within a catalogue of virtues.\nPerseverance in human associations often requires individuals to make\nsacrifices for the good of the individual or group with whom the\nindividual associates, sacrifices that self-interest naturally tempts\nus not to make.\n\nThe second problem has to do with the idea that loyalty requires us to\nset aside good judgment. No doubt something of that kind is attempted\nby those who seek to exploit loyalty (and other virtues such as\ngenerosity and kindness). But the well-established idea of a\n\u201cloyal opposition\u201d should give pause to the suggestion\nthat loyalty requires complaisance or servility (see section 6,\nLimiting Loyalty). Further, if the setting aside of good judgment is\nsought, there is nothing to stop a person\u2014albeit with a heavy\nheart\u2014from questioning whether the object of loyalty may have\nforfeited claims to it. The trust that tends to accompany loyalty need\nnot encompass gullibility and credulity. In the ordinary course of\nevents, the trust that accompanies loyalty has a judgment of\ntrustworthiness as its background.\n\nEwin\u2019s challenge does, nevertheless, raise the important\nquestion whether judgments about the worth of loyalty are reducible to\njudgments about the worth of the associations to which loyalty is\ngiven or the legitimacy of what is done as a result of them. Does\nloyalty have any value independent of the particular associational\nobject with which it is connected or is its value bound up exclusively\nwith the object of loyalty? There is disagreement on this (paralleling\ndisagreements about the obligatoriness of promise keeping). Some argue\nthat loyalty is virtuous or vicious depending on what is done out of\nloyalty. Others argue that loyalty is always virtuous, albeit\noverridden when associated with immoral conduct. In the case of a\nloyal Nazi whose loyalty expresses itself in anti-semitic forms, we\ncould respond in one of two ways. On the one hand, we could point to\nthe fact that the loyalty is likely to aggravate the harm caused. On\nthe other hand, were such a Nazi to act disloyally by allowing Jews\nwho bribed him to escape, we could argue that he is doubly\ndeficient\u2014self-serving and defective in his capacity to form\nclose bonds. Certainly the value of particular associations is of\nimportance to how we value loyalty to those associations; but it is\ndoubtful whether the value of loyalty is simply reducible to the value\nof the association in question. A person without loyalty or incapable\nof forming loyalties would seem to be defective as a person.\n\nIf loyalty is a virtue, what kind of virtue is it? The virtues are a\nmixed bag, conceptually and normatively. There are, for example, moral\nand intellectual virtues, Christian and pagan virtues. In the instant\ncase, there is a distinction between substantive and executive\nvirtues. The substantive virtues include compassion, fellow-feeling,\nkindness, and generosity, whereas the executive virtues include\nsincerity, courage, industriousness, and conscientiousness.\nSubstantive virtues motivate us to act well, that is, to do good, and\nare critical to our moral relations with others (and, in the case of\nprudence, to our own interests as well). The executive virtues, or, as\nthey are sometimes known, virtues of the will, are important to the\nimplementation of what the substantive virtues require of\nus\u2014sincerity in our compassion, courage in our kindness,\nconscientiousness in our generosity. They help us to surmount\nobstacles to our doing good. Loyalty, like sincerity, is an executive\nvirtue, and its worth in a particular case is especially sensitive to\nthe value of its object. Like other executive virtues, it can become\nattached to unworthy objects\u2014one may be a loyal Nazi or sincere\nracist. But that does not make their virtuousness merely contingent or\noptional. A world or person without sincerity or conscientiousness or\nloyalty would be a seriously deficient one. The capacity and ability\nto persevere in human associations that may require sacrifices from us\nare important to develop and exercise, and are what the virtue of\nloyalty consists in. Thus, insofar as we express loyalty in particular\nloyalties, we should distinguish the assessment of whether someone has\nthe virtue of loyalty from assessments of the worth of particular\nloyalties.\n\nThe executive virtues are an important ingredient in human excellence,\nbut, like all virtues, they should not be cultivated in isolation from\nthe substantive ones. When Aristotle discussed the virtues, he argued\nfor the importance of phronesis or practical wisdom in the\napplication of the virtues so that they would not be deficient,\nexcessive, or misplaced. In the fully virtuous person, the virtues\nwere never meant to be possessed in isolation but as an integrated\ncluster\u2014one of the things the ancients were plausibly getting at\nwhen they spoke of the unity of the virtues.\n\nThere is sometimes a further question about whether loyalty, even if a\nvirtue, should be seen as a moral virtue. Loyalty may be thought\nexcellent to have\u2014even a component of a good life\u2014but is\nit essentially a moral disposition? The divisions among virtues (say,\nintellectual, moral, personal, and social) are, however, at best\nunclear and probably overlapping. Kindness is almost always morally\ncommendable, but imaginativeness (often said to be an intellectual\nvirtue), courage (usually categorized as a personal virtue) and\nreliability (sometimes called a social virtue) may be shown on the\nsports field or by enemy soldiers as well as in contexts that render\nthem morally commendable. There may be no great value in attempts to\ndifferentiate loyalty (and other virtues) into rigid and exclusive\ncategories. What is almost certainly arguable is that a person who is\ncompletely devoid of loyalties would be deficient as a person\nunderstood inter alia as a moral agent.\n5. Justifying loyalty\n\nThere is a great deal of contingency to the development of loyalties.\nThe loyalties we develop to family, tribe, country, and religion often\nemerge almost naturally as we become increasingly aware of the social\nrelations that have formed us. Our identifications can be very deep\nand are often unquestioning. For some writers, this unchosenness is\nwhat distinguishes loyalty from other commitments such as fidelity\n(Allen, 1989). But loyalty also extends to consciously acquired\nrelational commitments, as we choose to associate with particular\npeople, groups, and institutions. Whether those latter loyalties\ndevelop depends on the extent to which the associations we choose to\nbe involved in acquire some intrinsic significance for us beyond any\ninstrumental value that may have first attracted us to them. Such\nexplanatory accounts, however, do not justify the loyalties we form or\nmay be inclined to form. Yet, because loyalties privilege their\nobjects, the provision of a justification is important.\n\nFor some writers, the distinction between chosen and unchosen\nloyalties is critical. Simon Keller, for example, considers that our\ngeneral unwillingness to question unchosen loyalties exhibits the lack\nof integrity often referred to as bad faith. Once we have such\nloyalties\u2014he focuses on patriotic loyalties\u2014we are\nresistant to their scrutiny and self-defensively discount challenges\nto them (Keller, 2005; 2007). There may be some truth to the view that\nwe are more likely to show bad faith as far as our unchosen loyalties\nare concerned, but it may be difficult to offer that as a general\ncomment on unchosen loyalties. There may be no more reason not to call\nour patriotism into question when we see how our country is behaving\nthan there is not to call a friendship into question when we see how\nour friend is behaving. It may be psychologically harder (and a moral\nhazard associated with loyalties) to challenge unchosen loyalties, but\nthat does not sustain a general judgment about them.\n\nSome have treated arguments for associational loyalty as though they\nwere cut from the same cloth as general arguments for associational\nobligations. They have, therefore, embedded claims for loyalty in\n\u201cfair-play\u201d or\n\u201cnatural-duty-to-support-just-institutions\u201d arguments for\nassociational obligations. But whatever the merits of such arguments\nas grounds for general institutional obligations, they do not provide\ngrounds for the particularistic obligations that we connect with\nloyalty. They do not capture the particularity of such obligations.\nEven consent-based arguments are insufficiently particularistic.\nLeaving aside the possibility that our basic political or parental or\nother associational obligations may also include an obligation to be\nloyal, we can usually fulfill what we take those obligations to be\nwithout any sense of loyalty to their objects. Obligations of loyalty\npresuppose an associational identification that more general\ninstitutional or membership obligations do not.\n\nOf the various instrumental justifications of loyalty, the most\ncredible is probably that developed by A.O. Hirschman (1970; 1974).\nHirschman assumes, along with many other institutional theorists, that\nvalued social relationships and institutions have an endemic tendency\nto decline. He claims, however, that social life would be seriously\nimpoverished were we self-advantageously to transfer or relinquish our\nassociational affiliations whenever a particular social institution\nfailed to deliver the goods associated with our connection to it, or\nwhenever a more successful provider of that good came along. On this\naccount, loyalty can be seen as a mechanism whereby we (at least\ntemporarily) persist in our association with the institution (or\naffiliation) while efforts are made (through giving voice) to bring it\nback on track. Loyalty commits us to securing or restoring the\nproductivity of socially valued institutions or affiliations. To the\nextent, then, that an institution or affiliation provides highly\ndesired or needed goods for people, they have reason to be loyal to it\nand, ceteris paribus, their loyalty should be given to the point at\nwhich it becomes clear that the institution is no longer capable of\nbeing recuperated or that one\u2019s loyal efforts will be in\nvain.\n\nBut as valuable as loyalty may be for associational recuperation, it\nis not clear that we can link its justification only to its\nrecuperative potential. For even within a generally consequentialist\nframework loyalty may play a more positive role. The loyal alumnus who\ndonates $100 million to an already healthy endowment fund is\ncontributing to institutional advancement rather than stemming\ninstitutional decline. In such a case the loyalty expresses a desire\nto further institutional interests rather than restore or even\npreserve them. The donation is seen as an expression of loyalty\nbecause it expresses a commitment to the institution in the face of\nthe alternatives available to the donor. An outside philanthropist\nmight, however, choose to donate the same amount, albeit not out of\nloyalty to the institution.\n\nMore critically, if loyalty is viewed simply in terms of the goods\nthat the associative object is able to secure or produce, the\nintrinsic value that the association has come to have for the loyal\nperson is overlooked, along with the sense of identification that it\nexpresses. It is out of that sense of identification that loyalty\narises.\n\nAn alternative account is that loyalty is owed to various associations\nas a debt of gratitude. Although gratitude as a ground of obligation\nalso stands in need of justification (McConnell, 1983), it tends to be\nmore widely acceptable as a justifying reason than loyalty. The fact\nthat we are the nonvoluntary beneficiaries of some of the associative\nrelations to which we are said to owe some of our primary\nloyalties\u2014say, familial, ethnic, or political\u2014has provided\nsome writers with a reason to think that gratitude grounds such\nloyalties (cf. Walker, 1988; Jecker, 1989).\n\nBut obligations of gratitude are not ipso facto obligations of\nloyalty: the brutalized Jew who was rescued by the Good Samaritan may\nhave had a debt of gratitude but he had no debt of loyalty (Luke\n10:25\u201337). Loyalty, moreover, may be owed where there is no\nreason for gratitude: as may be the case between friends. Obligations\nof gratitude are recompensive, whereas obligations of loyalty sustain\nassociations.\n\nThere may be a deeper reason for thinking that\u2014in some\nassociative relations\u2014loyalty ought to be fostered and shown. It\nresides in the conception of ourselves as social beings. We do not\ndevelop into the persons we are and aspire to be in the same fashion\nas a tree develops from a seedling into its mature form. Our genetic\nsubstratum is not as determinative of our final form as a\ntree\u2019s. Nor do we (generally) flourish as the persons we become\nand aspire to remain in the manner of a tree. We are social creatures\nwho are what we are because of our embeddedness in and ongoing\ninvolvement with relations and groups and communities of various\nkinds. Though these evolve over time, such social affiliations (or at\nleast some of them) become part of who we are; and, moreover, our\nassociation with such individuals, groups, and communities (though\noften instrumentally valued) becomes part of what we conceive a good\nlife to be for us. Our loyal obligation to them arises out of the\nvalue that our association with them has for us.\n\nA broad justification such as this leaves unstated what associations\nmight be constitutive of human flourishing. Perhaps there is no\ndefinitive list. But most would include friendships, familial\nrelationships, and some of the social institutions that foster,\nsustain, and secure the social life in which we engage as part of our\nflourishing. To the extent that we accept that engagement with or in a\nparticular form of association or relation is constitutive of our\nflourishing, to that extent we will consider loyalty to it to be\njustified\u2014even required.\n\nThe arguments that justify loyalty do not ipso facto justify unlimited\nsacrifice in the name of loyalty, though they do not rule out the\npossibility that, for example, a person might legitimately be willing,\nas an expression of loyalty, to lay down his life for another. That is\noften the case in wartime and may also be true of some friendships.\nThe strength of the claims of loyalty will depend on the importance of\nthe association to the person who has the association and, of course,\non the legitimacy of the association in question. Not only may some\nassociative relations be illegitimate, but the expectations of one\nassociation may come into conflict with those of another: we may have\nconflicts of loyalty. If the conflict is resolved by giving one\nloyalty precedence over another, it does not necessarily follow that\nloyalty to the one is disloyalty to the other. It is no disloyalty to\na friend who is counting on me if instead I attend to my dying\nmother\u2019s needs. Sometimes such priorities will be\nstraightforward, at other times not. Prioritization may, nevertheless,\ncall for an apology and compensation in respect of the disappointed\nparty. Even if we decide unwisely, our decision will not ipso facto\ncount as disloyalty. Disloyalty is more often associated with the\nself-serving or hypocritical abandonment of loyalty.\n6. Limiting loyalty\n\nIt has already been noted that it is not part of loyalty to be\ncomplaisant or servile, though loyalty may be corrupted into such. In\nany plausible account of loyalty as a virtue there must be openness to\ncorrective criticism on the part of both the subject and object of\nloyalty. The \u201ccorrective\u201d qualification is important. Not\nany opposition is permissible. A loyal opponent is not just an\nopponent, but one who remains loyal. What that entails is that the\nopposition stays within bounds that are compatible with the well-being\nor best interests or flourishing of the object of loyalty. Generally\nspeaking, a loyal opposition will not advocate (the equivalent of)\nrebellion or revolution for the latter would jeopardize the object of\nloyalty (and perhaps lead to its replacement by an alternative object\nof loyalty).\n\nIt is the commitment to opposition within (what are judged to be) the\nprevailing structures that has led some radical critics of loyalty\n(e.g., Agassi, 1974; Greene, 1973) to see it as\u2014at\nbottom\u2014a conservative virtue. It is conservative,\nthough in a positive sense of that word: it involves a commitment to\nsecuring or preserving the interests of an associational object, an\nobject that is, or has come to be, valued for its own sake (whatever\nelse it may be valued for). Nevertheless, the existence of a loyal\nopposition need not preclude the possibility that a more radical\nopposition might and indeed should subsequently be mounted. If the\nloyal opposition proves incapable of \u201creforming\u201d the\nobject of loyalty, the exit option (or something stronger) might be\ntaken. In such cases it could be argued that the object of loyalty was\nno longer worthy of loyalty or had forfeited its claim to it. It is\nonly if we mistakenly or misguidedly think of loyalty as making an\nunconditional claim on us that a derogatory charge of conservatism\nagainst a loyal opposition will have traction (see Kleinig, 2019).\n\nFor heuristic purposes, we can probably distinguish loyalty to a\ntype of association (such as a state) or a particular\ninstantiation of the type (such as the United States). Strictly,\nloyalty will be only to the latter, though it assists in understanding\nthe limits of loyalty if we make the distinction. If the type of\ninstitution is thought to be critical to human flourishing, then\nloyalty to it will be expected. But if the institution is of\nrelatively minor significance, the development of instantiations of\nit, along with loyalty to them, will be relatively unimportant (though\nnot necessarily to those who develop such loyalties). Whether, for\nexample, patriotism (that is, patriotic loyalty) is justified will\ndepend in part on the importance to be accorded to a state or country.\nIf we are social contractarians, then the state (broadly conceived)\noffers a significant solution to some of the problems of human\nassociation as well as an arena for social identification. We might\nthink that both the state in general and loyalty to it are important.\nThe state in general, however, needs to be embodied in a particular\nstate, and that state may be such that the loyalty it should\ngarner is forfeited by how it acts.\n\nLoyalty to a particular object is forfeited\u2014that is, its claims\nfor the protection and reinforcement of associative identity and\ncommitment run out\u2014when the object shows itself to be no longer\nworthy or capable of being a source of associational satisfaction or\nidentity-giving significance. That is, the claims run out for the\nonce-loyal associate. (Others, of course, may dispute this.) But\nwhether or not loyalty is thought to be justifiably forfeited, the\nbreakpoint may differ for different people. Consider the case of\ninfidelity. For one woman, a husband\u2019s infidelity challenges the\nfuture of the relationship but does not automatically destroy it. The\nrelationship will be considered reparable. The issues of trust that\nare involved may be addressed and the relationship repaired. But for\nanother, such infidelity may collapse the structure in which the\nrelationship has been housed.\n\nIs there a right and a wrong in such cases? Does the first woman lack\nan appreciation of the \u201csanctity\u201d of marriage/intimacy?\nDoes the second fail to appreciate our shared frailty and the\npossibilities for redemption and renewal? We should probably not\nacquiesce in the relativistic view that what is right for one is wrong\nfor the other. At the same time, however, there may be no easy answer.\nThe two positions constitute the beginnings of a consideration of the\nnature of intimacy, what it reasonably demands of us, and how we\nshould respond to transgressions of its expectations.\n\nThe same may be true of other loyalties. Our approach may be assisted\nby utilizing the earlier heuristic distinction between the general\nform of an association and its particular instantiation. We may be\nable to reach some general consensus on what a state might reasonably\nexpect of us. However, in any actual association with a particular\nstate the content of the bond may be individualized.\n6.1 Whistle blowing\n\nThe issue of loyalty\u2019s limits is usefully illustrated by the\nphenomenon of what is sometimes distinguished as external\n\u201cwhistle blowing.\u201d Although there is some debate about its\nscope, whistle blowing can be helpfully (if not fully) characterized\nas the activity of an employee within an organization\u2014public or\nprivate\u2014who alerts a wider group to setbacks to their interests\nas a result of waste, corruption, fraud, or profit-seeking (Westin,\n1981; Bowman, 1990; Miethe, 1999). Because such employees are\ngenerally considered disloyal, it has been common to characterize them\nas traitors, snitches, weasels, squealers, or rats. \u201cWhistle\nblower\u201d offers a more neutral way of referring to such people,\nand permits an inquiry into the proper limits of employee loyalty.\n\nThe normative background to whistle blowing is a belief that employees\nowe loyalty to their employing organizations. Such loyalty will\ninclude an expectation that employees not jeopardize their\norganization\u2019s interests by revealing certain kinds of\ninformation to people outside it. If employees have grievances, they\nshould be dealt with within the organization (\u201cwe wash our own\nlaundry\u201d). The case for whistle blowing, then, is driven by the\nrecognition, first of all, that internal mechanisms often fail to deal\nadequately with an organization\u2019s failures, and second, that\nbecause the interests jeopardized by those failures often include\nthose outside the organization, a wider group has a prima facie right\nto know of the costs that it faces or that have been imposed on\nit.\n\nBlowing the whistle frequently creates significant disruption within\nan organization\u2014it may lose control of its affairs as it is\nsubjected to external inquiries and constraints; it may find itself\ncrippled by costs or other restrictions; and many within it who are\nlittle more than innocent bystanders may suffer from the repercussions\nof an externally mounted investigation. Because whistle blowing\njeopardizes the organization\u2019s interests (at least as they are\nunderstood within the organization), whistle blowing is therefore seen\nas a significant act of disloyalty. Whistle blowers themselves will\noften argue that owed loyalty has been forfeited (or at least\noverridden), so that no (condemnable) disloyalty has been perpetrated.\nOccasionally they will argue that whistle blowing can be an act of\nloyalty.\n\nA resolution to such conflicting assessments must address the issue of\nloyalty\u2019s limits and, in the case of whistle blowing, it must\ntake cognizance of several considerations: (i) Because of the\ndisruption it threatens, the whistle should be blown only as a matter\nof last resort. (ii) For the same reason the organizational\nwrongdoing should be sufficiently serious. (iii) The public\ncomplaint should be well-grounded\u2014the reasons that\nsupport it should be strong enough to be publicly defensible. (iv) A\npotential whistleblower should consider whether he or she has a\nspecial role-related obligation to take some action. Although\nany member of an organization might have some responsibility for what\nis done in its name, some members will be better placed to make\nappropriate assessments of seriousness and may be more responsible for\nthe way in which the organization conducts its activities. (v) Because\nthe purpose of blowing the whistle is to bring about change, the\npotential for the whistle blowing to be effective ought to be\nconsidered. (vi) It is sometimes argued that the act of whistle\nblowing needs to be appropriately motivated\u2014it must at\nleast be done out of concern for those whose interests are being\njeopardized. This last consideration, however, may have more to do\nwith the whistle blower\u2019s praiseworthiness than with the\njustifiability of blowing the whistle. A morally compromised\nwhistleblower, however, may find his or her credibility undermined and\nthe expos\u00e9 rendered ineffective.\n\nEven if the foregoing considerations are satisfactorily addressed,\nthere remains a question whether blowing the whistle is obligatory or\nmerely permissible. As omissions, failures to blow the whistle must\nengage with debates about the moral obligatoriness of our acting to\nprevent harm. Even if it is morally obligatory, though, there may be\nreasons for not making whistle blowing legally mandatory. In addition,\nthe potential costs to a whistleblower may excuse even legally\nmandated reporting of organizational wrongdoing (Glazer & Glazer,\n1989; Martin, 1992). Although legal protections for whistle blowers\nhave been instituted in some jurisdictions, they have often proved\ninadequate (Glazer & Glazer, 1989).\n\nAnonymous whistle blowing represents a possible solution; it opens the\ndoor, however, to disruptive whistles being blown for the wrong\nreasons or after careless investigation (cf. Elliston, 1982; Coulson,\n1982).\n\nIn sum, the case of whistle blowing illustrates not only the\nimportance of loyalty to many organizations but also the care that\nneeds to be exercised when it is claimed that obligations of loyalty\nare justifiably overridden or forfeited.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aeschylus, 2003 [485BCE], <em>Oresteia</em>, trans., intro., and\nnotes Christopher Collard, New York: Oxford University Press,\n2003.", "Agassi, Joseph, 1974, \u201cThe Last Refuge of the\nScoundrel,\u201d <em>Philosophia</em>, 4(2/3): 315\u201317.", "Allen, R.T., 1989, \u201cWhen Loyalty No Harm Meant,\u201d\n<em>Review of Metaphysics</em>, 43: 281\u201394.", "Baron, Marcia, 1984, <em>The Moral Status of Loyalty</em>,\nDubuque, IO: Kendall/Hunt.", "Bennett, William J., 2004, <em>Virtues of Friendship and\nLoyalty</em>, Nashville, TN: Thomas Nelson Publishers.", "Bernstein, Mark, 1991, \u201cSpeciesism and Loyalty,\u201d\n<em>Behavior and Philosophy</em>, 19(1): 43\u201359.", "Blamires, Harry, 1963, <em>The Christian Mind</em>, London:\nS.P.C.K.", "Bloch, Herbert A., 1934, <em>The Concept of our Changing\nLoyalties: An Introductory Study into the Nature of the Social\nIndividual</em>, New York: Columbia University Press.", "B\u00f6sz\u00f6rm\u00e9nyi-Nagy, Iv\u00e1n &amp; Spark,\nGeraldine M., 1973, <em>Invisible Loyalties: Reciprocity in\nIntergenerational Family Therapy</em>, second edition, New York:\nBrunner-Mazel.", "Bowman, J.S., 1990, \u201cWhistle Blowing in the Public Sector:\nan Overview of the Issues,\u201d in <em>Combating\nCorruption/Encouraging Ethics: a Sourcebook for Public Service\nEthics</em>, W.W.
