During that\ncentury, the founders of modern aesthetics not only began to take\nnature as a paradigmatic object of aesthetic experience, they also\ndeveloped the concept of disinterestedness as the mark of such\nexperience. Over the course of the century, this concept was\nelaborated by various thinkers, who employed it to purge from\naesthetic appreciation an ever-increasing range of interests and\nassociations. According to one standard account (Stolnitz 1961), the\nconcept originated with the third Earl of Shaftesbury, who introduced\nit as a way of characterizing the notion of the aesthetic, was\nembellished by Francis Hutcheson, who expanded it so as to exclude\nfrom aesthetic experience not simply personal and utilitarian\ninterests, but also associations of a more general nature, and was\nfurther developed by Archibald Alison, who took it to refer to a\nparticular state of mind. The concept was given its classic\nformulation in Immanuel Kant\u2019s Critique of Judgment, in\nwhich nature was taken as an exemplary object of aesthetic experience.\nKant argued that natural beauty was superior to that of art and that\nit complemented the best habits of mind. It is no accident that the\ndevelopment of the concept of disinterestedness and the acceptance of\nnature as an ideal object of aesthetic appreciation went hand in hand.\nThe clarification of the notion of the aesthetic in terms of the\nconcept of disinterestedness disassociated the aesthetic appreciation\nof nature from the appreciator\u2019s particular personal, religious,\neconomic, or utilitarian interests, any of which could impede\naesthetic experience.\n\nThe theory of disinterestedness also provided groundwork for\nunderstanding the aesthetic dimensions of nature in terms of three\ndistinct conceptualizations. The first involved the idea of the\nbeautiful, which readily applies to tamed and cultivated\ngardens and landscapes. The second centered on the idea of the\nsublime. In the experience of the sublime, the more\nthreatening and terrifying of nature\u2019s manifestations, such as\nmountains and wilderness, when viewed with disinterestedness, can be\naesthetically appreciated, rather than simply feared or despised.\nThese two notions were importantly elaborated by Edmund Burke and\nKant. However, concerning the appreciation of nature, a third concept\nwas to become more significant than that of either the beautiful or\nthe sublime: the notion of the picturesque. Thus, by the end\nof the eighteenth century, there were three clearly distinct ideas\neach focusing on different aspects of nature\u2019s diverse and often\ncontrasting moods. One historian of the picturesque tradition (Conron\n2000) argues that in \u201ceighteenth-century English theory, the\nboundaries between aesthetic categories are relatively clear and\nstable\u201d. The differences can be summarized as follows: objects\nexperienced as beautiful tend to be small and smooth, but subtly\nvaried, delicate, and \u201cfair\u201d in color, while those\nexperienced as sublime, by contrast, are powerful, vast, intense,\nterrifying, and \u201cdefinitionless\u201d. Picturesque items are\ntypically in the middle ground between those experienced as either\nsublime or beautiful, being complex and eccentric, varied and\nirregular, rich and forceful, and vibrant with energy.\n\nIt is not surprising that of these three notions, the idea of the\npicturesque, rather that of the beautiful or the sublime, achieved the\ngreatest prominence concerning the aesthetic experience of nature. Not\nonly does it occupy the extensive middle ground of the complex,\nirregular, forceful, and vibrant, all of which abound in the natural\nworld, it also reinforced various long-standing connections between\nthe aesthetic appreciation of nature and the treatment of nature in\nart. The term \u201cpicturesque\u201d literally means\n\u201cpicture-like\u201d and the theory of the picturesque advocates\naesthetic appreciation in which the natural world is experienced as if\ndivided into art-like scenes, which ideally resemble works of arts,\nespecially landscape painting, in both subject matter and composition.\nThus, since the concept of disinterestedness mandated appreciation of\nnature stripped of the appreciator\u2019s own personal interests and\nassociations, it helped to clear the ground for experience of nature\ngoverned by the theory of the picturesque, by which the appreciator is\nencouraged to see nature in terms of a new set of artistic images and\nassociations. In this way the idea of the picturesque relates to\nearlier conceptions of the natural world as comprised of what were\ncalled \u201cworks of nature\u201d, which, although considered in\nthemselves to be proper and important objects of aesthetic experience,\nwere thought to be even more appealing when they resembled works of\nart. The idea also resonates with other artistic traditions, such as\nthat of viewing art as the mirror of nature. The theory of the\npicturesque received its fullest treatment in the late eighteenth\ncentury when it was popularized in the writings of William Gilpin,\nUvedale Price, and Richard Payne Knight. At that time, it provided an\naesthetic ideal for English tourists, who pursued picturesque scenery\nin the Lake District, the Scottish Highlands, and the Alps.\n",
