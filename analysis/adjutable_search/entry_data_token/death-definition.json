The first question is ontological or\nconceptual. An answer to this question will consist of a\ndefinition (or conceptualization). Examples include\ndeath as the irreversible cessation of organismic functioning\nand human death as the irreversible loss of personhood. The\nsecond question is epistemological. A complete answer to this question\nwill furnish both a general standard (or criterion)\nfor determining that death has occurred and specific clinical\ntests to show whether the standard has been met in a given case.\nExamples of standards for human death are the traditional\ncardiopulmonary standard and the whole-brain\nstandard. Insofar as clinical tests are primarily a medical\nconcern, the present entry will address them only in passing.\n\nThe philosophical issues concerning the correct definition and\nstandard for human death are closely connected to other questions. How\ndoes the death of human beings relate to the death of other living\nthings? Is human death simply an instance of organismic death,\nultimately a matter of biology? If not, on what basis should it be\ndefined? Whatever the answers to these questions, does death or at\nleast human death have an essence\u2014either de re or\nde dicto\u2014entailing necessary and jointly sufficient\nconditions? Or do the varieties of death reveal only \u201cfamily\nresemblance\u201d relations? Are life and death exhaustive categories\nof those things that are ever animated, or do some individuals fall\ninto an ontological neutral zone between life and death? Finally, how\ndo our deaths relate, conceptually, to our essence and identity as\nhuman persons?\n\nFor the most part, such questions did not clamor for public attention\nuntil well into the twentieth century. (For historical background, see\nPernick 1999 and Capron 1999, 120\u2013124.) Sufficient destruction\nof the brain, including the brainstem, ensured respiratory failure\nleading quickly to terminal cardiac arrest. Conversely, prolonged\ncardiopulmonary failure inevitably led to total, irreversible loss of\nbrain function. With the invention of mechanical respirators in the\n1950s, however, it became possible for a previously lethal extent of\nbrain damage to coexist with continued cardiopulmonary functioning,\nsustaining the functioning of other organs. Was such a patient alive\nor dead? The widespread dissemination in the 1960s of such\ntechnologies as mechanical respirators and defibrillators to restore\ncardiac function highlighted the possibility of separating\ncardiopulmonary and neurological functioning. Quite rapidly the\nquestions of what constituted human death and how we could determine\nits occurrence had emerged as issues both philosophically rich and\nurgent.\n\nVarious practical concerns provided further impetus for addressing\nthese issues. (Reflecting these concerns is a landmark 1968 report\npublished by a Harvard Medical School committee led by physician Henry\nBeecher (Ad Hoc Committee of the Harvard Medical School 1968).)\nSoaring medical expenditures provoked concerns about prolonged,\npossibly futile treatment of patients who presented some but not all\nof the traditionally recognized indicators of death. Certainly, it\nwould be permissible to discontinue life-supports if these patients\nwere dead. Concurrent interest in the evolving techniques of organ\ntransplantation motivated physicians not to delay unnecessarily in\ndetermining that a patient had died. Removing vital organs as quickly\nas possible would improve the prospect of saving lives. But removing\nvital organs of living patients would cause their deaths, violating\nboth laws against homicide and the widely accepted moral principle\nprohibiting the intentional killing of innocent human beings (see the\nentry on\n doing vs. allowing harm).\n To be sure, there were\u2014as there are now\u2014individuals who\nheld that procuring organs from, thereby killing, irreversibly\nunconscious patients who had consented to donate is a legitimate\nexception to this moral principle (see the entry on\n voluntary euthanasia),\n but this judgment strikes many as a radical departure from common\nmorality. In any event, in view of concerns about the possibility of\nkilling in the course of organ procurement, physicians wanted clear\nlegal guidance for determining when someone had died.\n\nThe remainder of this entry takes a dialectical form, focusing\nprimarily on ideas and arguments rather than on history and\nindividuals. It begins with an approach that nearly achieved consensus\nstatus after these issues came under the spotlight in the twentieth\ncentury: the whole-brain approach. (Most of what are here\nreferred to as \u201capproaches\u201d include a standard and a\ncorresponding definition of death; a few offer more radical\nsuggestions for how to understand human death.) The discussion\nproceeds, in turn, to the higher-brain approach, to an\nupdated cardiopulmonary approach, and to several more radical\napproaches. The discussion of each approach examines its chief\nassertions, its answers to questions identified above, leading\narguments in its favor, and its chief difficulties. The entry as a\nwhole is intended to identify the main philosophical issues connected\nwith the definition and determination of human death, leading\napproaches that have been developed to address these issues, and\nprincipal strengths and difficulties of these visions viewed as\ncompetitors.\n", "toc": [{"#1CurMaiVieWhoBraApp": "1.

The Current Mainstream View: The Whole-Brain Approach\n\nAccording to the whole-brain standard, human death is the\nirreversible cessation of functioning of the entire brain, including\nthe brainstem. This standard is generally associated with an\norganismic definition of death (as explained below). Unlike the older\ncardiopulmonary standard, the whole-brain standard assigns\nsignificance to the difference between assisted and\nunassisted respiration. A mechanical respirator can enable\nbreathing, and thereby circulation, in a \u201cbrain-dead\u201d\npatient\u2014a patient whose entire brain is irreversibly\nnonfunctional. But such a patient necessarily lacks the capacity for\nunassisted respiration. On the old view, such a patient\ncounted as alive so long as respiration of any sort (assisted or\nunassisted) occurred. But on the whole-brain account, such a patient\nis dead. The present approach also maintains that someone in a\npermanent (irreversible) vegetative state is alive because a\nfunctioning brainstem enables spontaneous respiration and\ncirculation as well as certain primitive\n reflexes.[1]\n\nBefore turning to arguments for and against the whole-brain standard,\nit may be helpful to review some basic facts about the human brain,\n\u201cwhole-brain death\u201d (total brain failure), and other\nstates of permanent (irreversible) unconsciousness. (The most\nimportant terms for our purposes appear in italics.) We may think of\nthe brain as comprising two major portions: (1) the \u201chigher\nbrain,\u201d consisting of both the cerebrum, the\nprimary vehicle of conscious awareness, and the cerebellum, which is\ninvolved in the coordination and control of voluntary muscle\nmovements; and (2) the \u201clower brain\u201d or\nbrainstem. The brainstem includes the medulla, which\ncontrols spontaneous respiration, the reticular activating\nsystem, a sort of on/off switch that enables consciousness\nwithout affecting its contents (the latter job belonging to the\ncerebrum), as well as the midbrain and pons.\n\nWith these basic concepts in view, it may be easier to contrast\nvarious states of permanent unconsciousness. (For a helpful overview,\nsee Cranford 1995.) \u201cWhole-brain death\u201d or\ntotal brain failure involves the destruction of the entire\nbrain, both the higher brain and the brainstem. By contrast, in a\npermanent (irreversible) vegetative state\n(PVS), while the higher brain is extensively damaged, causing\nirretrievable loss of consciousness, the brainstem is largely intact.\nThus, as noted earlier, a patient in a PVS is alive according to the\nwhole-brain standard. Retaining brainstem functions, PVS patients\nexhibit some or all of the following: unassisted respiration and\nheartbeat; wake and sleep cycles (made possible by an intact reticular\nactivating system, though destruction to the cerebrum precludes\nconsciousness); pupillary reaction to light and eyes movements; and\nsuch reflexes as swallowing, gagging, and coughing. A rare form of\nunconsciousness that is distinct from PVS and tends to lead fairly\nquickly to death is permanent (irreversible)\ncoma. This state, in which patients never appear to be awake,\ninvolves partial brainstem functioning. Permanently comatose patients,\nlike PVS patients, can maintain breathing and heartbeat without\nmechanical assistance.\n\nWith this background, we turn to the advantages and disadvantages of\nthe whole-brain approach. First, what considerations favor this\napproach over the traditional focus on cardiopulmonary function in\ndetermining death? The most prominent and arguably the most powerful\ncase for the whole-brain standard appeals to two considerations: (1)\nthe organismic definition of death and (2) an emphasis on the brain's\nrole as the primary integrator of overall bodily functioning. (Some\nwho regard a general definition of death as unnecessary have focused\non consideration (2) in defending the whole-brain standard. Some\nothers, as discussed later, have retained consideration (1) but\ndropped consideration (2).) An additional consideration that has been\ninfluential, yet is logically separable from the other two, is (3) the\nthesis that the whole-brain standard updates, without replacing, the\ntraditional approach to defining death.\n\nAccording to the organismic definition, death is the irreversible\nloss of functioning of the organism as a whole (Becker 1975;\nBernat, Culver, and Gert 1981). Proponents of this approach emphasize\nthat death is a biological occurrence common to all organisms.\nAlthough individual cells and organs live and die, organisms are the\nonly entities that literally do so without being parts of larger\nbiological systems. (Ideas, cultures, and machines live and die only\nfiguratively; cells and tissues are literally alive but are parts of\nlarger biological systems.) So an adequate definition of death must be\nadequate in the case of all organisms. What happens when a paramecium,\nclover, tree, mosquito, rabbit, or human dies? The organism stops\nfunctioning as an integrated unit and breaks down, turning what was\nonce a dynamic object that took energy from the environment to\nmaintain its own structure and functioning into an inert piece of\nmatter subject to disintegration and decay. In the case of humans, no\nless than other organisms, death involves the collapse of integrated\nbodily functioning.\n\nThe whole-brain standard does not follow straightforwardly from the\norganismic conception of death. One might insist, after all, that a\nhuman organism's death occurs upon irreversible loss of\ncardiopulmonary function. Why think the brain so important? According\nto the mainstream whole-brain approach, the human brain plays the\ncrucial role of integrating major bodily functions so only the death\nof the entire brain is necessary and sufficient for a human being's\ndeath (Bernat, Culver, and Gert 1981). Although heartbeat and\nbreathing normally indicate life, they do not constitute life. Life\ninvolves integrated functioning of the whole organism. Circulation and\nrespiration are centrally important, but so are maintenance of body\ntemperature, hormonal regulation, and various other functions\u2014as\nwell as, in humans and other higher animals, consciousness. The brain\nmakes all of these vital functions possible. Their integration within\nthe organism is due to a central integrator, the brain.\n\nThis leading case for the whole-brain standard, then, consists in an\norganismic conception of death coupled with a view of the brain as the\nchief integrator of interdependent bodily functions. Another\nconsideration sometimes advanced in favor of the whole-brain standard\npositions it as a part of time-honored tradition rather than a\ndeparture from tradition. (The argument may be understood either as an\nappeal to the authority of tradition or as an appeal to the\npracticality of not departing radically from tradition.) The claim is\nthat the traditional focus on cardiopulmonary function is part and\nparcel of the whole-brain approach, that the latter does not revise\nour understanding of death but merely updates it with a more\ncomprehensive picture that highlights the brain's crucial role:\n\nThree organs\u2014the heart, lungs, and brain\u2014assume special\nsignificance \u2026 because their interrelationship is close and the\nirreversible cessation of any one very quickly stops the other two and\nconsequently halts the integrated functioning of the organism as a\nwhole. Because they were easily measured, circulation and respiration\nwere traditionally the basic \u201cvital signs.\u201d But [they] are\nsimply used as signs\u2014as one window for viewing a deeper and more\ncomplex reality: a triangle of interrelated systems with the brain at\nits apex. [T]he traditional means of diagnosing death actually\ndetected an irreversible cessation of integrated functioning among the\ninterdependent bodily systems. When artificial means of support mask\nthis loss of integration as measured by the old methods,\nbrain-oriented criteria and tests provide a new window on the same\nphenomena (President's Commission 1981, 33).\n\n\nAccording to this view, when the entire brain is nonfunctional but\ncardiopulmonary function continues due to a respirator and perhaps\nother life-supports, the mechanical assistance presents a false\nappearance of life, concealing the absence of integrated functioning\nin the organism as a whole.\n\nThe whole-brain approach clearly enjoys advantages. First, whether or\nnot the whole-brain standard really incorporates, rather than\nreplacing, the traditional cardiopulmonary standard, the former is at\nleast fairly continuous with traditional practices and understandings\nconcerning human death. Indeed, current law in the American states\nincorporates both standards into disjunctive form, most states\nadopting the Uniform Determination of Death Act (UDDA) while others\nhave embraced similar language (Bernat 2006, 40). The UDDA states that\n\u201c\u2026 an individual who has sustained either (1)\nirreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions, or\n(2) irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain,\nincluding the brainstem, is dead,\u201d (President's Commission 1981,\n119). Similar legal developments have occurred in Canada (Law Reform\nCommission of Canada 1981; Canadian Congress Committee on Brain Death\n1988). The close pairing of the whole-brain and cardiopulmonary\nstandards in the law suggests that the whole-brain standard does not\ndepart radically from tradition.\n\nThe present approach offers other advantages as well. For one, the\nwhole-brain standard is prima facie plausible as a specification of\nthe organismic definition of death in the case of human beings.\nMoreover, acceptance of whole-brain criteria for death facilitates\norgan transplantation by permitting a declaration of death and\nretrieval of still-viable organs while respiration and circulation\ncontinue, with mechanical assistance, in a \u201cbrain-dead\u201d\nbody. Another practical advantage is permitting, without an advance\ndirective or proxy consent, discontinuation of costly life-support\nmeasures on patients who have incurred total brain failure. While most\nproponents of the whole-brain approach insist that such practical\nadvantages are merely fortunate consequences of the biological facts\nabout death, one might regard these advantages as part of the\njustification for a standard whose defense requires more than appeals\nto biology (see subsection 4.2 below).\n\nThe advantages proffered by this approach contributed to its\nwidespread social acceptance and legal adoption in the last few\ndecades of the 20th century. As mentioned, every American\nstate has legally adopted the whole-brain standard alongside the\ncardiopulmonary standard as in the UDDA. It is worth noting, however,\nthat a close cousin to the whole-brain standard, the brainstem\nstandard, was adopted by the United Kingdom and various other\nnations. According to the brainstem standard\u2014which has the\npractical advantage of requiring fewer clinical tests\u2014human\ndeath occurs at the irreversible cessation of brainstem function. One\nmight wonder whether a person's cerebrum could function\u2014enabling\nconsciousness\u2014while this standard is met, but the answer is no.\nSince the brainstem includes the reticular activating system, the\non/off switch that makes consciousness possible (without affecting its\ncontents), brainstem death entails irreversible loss not only of\nunassisted respiration and circulation but also of the capacity for\nconsciousness. Importantly, outside the English-speaking world, many\nor most nations, including virtually all developed countries, have\nlegally adopted either whole-brain or brainstem criteria for the\ndetermination of death (Wijdicks 2002). Moreover, most of the public,\nto the extent that it is aware of the relevant laws, appears to accept\nsuch criteria for death (ibid). Opponents commonly fall within one of\ntwo main groups. One group consists of religious\nconservatives\u2014and, recently, a growing number of secular\nacademics\u2014who favor the cardiopulmonary standard, according to\nwhich one can be brain-dead yet alive if (assisted) cardiopulmonary\nfunction persists. The other group consists of those liberal\nintellectuals who favor the higher-brain standard (to be discussed),\nwhich, notably, has not been adopted by any jurisdiction.\n\nThe widespread acceptance in the U.S. of the whole-brain standard and\nthe broader international acceptance of some sort of \u201cbrain\ndeath\u201d criteria\u2014whether whole-brain or brainstem\u2014are\nremarkable considering the subtlety of issues surrounding the\ndefinition and determination of death. Yet this near-consensus has\nbeen broader than it is deep. Increasingly, both in academic and\nclinical circles, doubts about \u201cbrain death\u201d are being\nvoiced. Following are several major challenges to the whole-brain\nstandard\u2014and, implicitly, to the brainstem standard. (Several\nadditional challenges are implicit in arguments supporting the\nhigher-brain approach.)\n\nThe first challenge is directed at proponents of the whole-brain\napproach who claim that its standard merely updates, without\nreplacing, the traditional cardiopulmonary standard. A major\ncontention that motivates this thesis is that irreversible cessation\nof brain function will quickly lead to irreversible loss of\ncardiopulmonary function (and vice versa). But extended maintenance on\nrespirators of patients with total brain failure has removed this\ncomponent of the case for the whole-brain standard (PCB 2008, 90). The\nremaining challenges to the whole-brain approach are not specifically\ndirected to those who assert that its standard merely updates the\ntraditional cardiopulmonary standard.\n\nFirst, in the case of at least some members of our species, total\nbrain failure is not necessary for death. After all, human\nembryos and early fetuses can die although, lacking brains, they\ncannot satisfy whole-brain criteria for death (Persson 2002,\n22\u201323). An advocate could respond by introducing a modified\ndefinition: In the case of any human being in possession of a\nfunctioning brain, death is the irreversible cessation of\nfunctioning of the entire brain. While this may be practically useful\nin the world as we know it for the foreseeable future, this definition\nis not conceptually satisfactory if it is possible in principle for\nsome human beings with brains (that is, who have functioning brains at\nany point in their existence) to die without destruction of their\nbrains. The \u201cin principle\u201d is important here, for this is\nnot possible in our world currently. But suppose we develop the\nability to transplant brains. (The thought-experiment that follows\nappears in McMahan 2002, 429.) Recall that the whole-brain standard is\ngenerally thought to receive support from an organismic definition of\ndeath. But such a conception of human death, one could argue, only\nmakes sense on the assumption that we are essentially human organisms\n(see discussion of the essence of human persons in section\n2.1)\u2014as some proponents explicitly acknowledge (see, e.g., Olson\n1997). According to the present critique, the brain is merely a\npart of the organism. Suppose the brain were removed from one\nof us, and kept intact and functioning, perhaps by being transplanted\ninto another, de-brained body. Bereft of mechanical assistance, the\nbody from which the brain was removed would surely die. But this body\nwas the living organism, one of us. So, although the original brain\ncontinues to function, the human being, one of us, would have died.\nTotal brain failure, then, is not strictly necessary for human death.\nA possible rebuttal to this challenge from one who accepts that we are\nessentially organisms is to argue that the existence of a functioning\nbrain is sufficient for the continued existence of the organism (van\nInwagen 1990, 173\u2013174, 180\u2013181). If so, then in the\nimagined scenario the original human being would survive the brain\ntransplant in a new body. Thus, the rebuttal concludes, it is false\nthat a human being could die although her brain continued to live.\n\nPerhaps more threatening to the whole-brain approach is the growing\nempirical evidence that total brain failure is not sufficient\nfor human death \u2014assuming the latter is construed, as\nwhole-brain advocates generally construe it, as the breakdown of integrated\norganismic functioning mediated by the brain. Many of our integrative\nfunctions, according to the challenge, are not mediated by the brain\nand can therefore persist in individuals who meet whole-brain criteria\nfor death by standard clinical tests. Such somatically integrating\nfunctions include homeostasis, assimilation of nutrients,\ndetoxification and recycling of cellular wastes, elimination, wound\nhealing, fighting of infections, and cardiovascular and hormonal\nstress responses to unanesthetized incisions (for organ procurement);\nin a few cases, brain-dead bodies have even gestated a fetus, matured\nsexually, or grown in size (Shewmon 2001; Potts 2001). It has been\nargued that most brain functions commonly cited as integrative merely\nsustain an existing functional integration, suggesting that the brain\nis more an enhancer than an indispensable integrator of bodily\nfunctions (Shewmon 2001). Moreover, several studies have demonstrated\nthat most patients diagnosed as brain dead continue to exhibit some\nbrain functions including the regulated secretion of vasopressin, a\nhormone critical to maintaining a body's balance of salt and fluid\n(Halevy 2001). This hormonal regulation is a brain function that\nrepresents an integrated function of the organism as a whole (Miller\nand Truog 2010).\n\nAnother, related problem for the sufficiency of total brain failure\nfor human death arises from reflection on locked-in syndrome.\nPeople with locked-in syndrome are conscious, and therefore alive, but\ncompletely paralyzed with the possible exception of their eyes. With\nintensive medical support they can live. The interesting fact for our\npurposes is that some patients with this syndrome exhibit no more\nsomatic functioning integrated by the brain than some brain-dead\nindividuals. Whatever integration of bodily functions remains is\nmaintained by external supports and by bodily systems other than the\nbrain, which merely preserves consciousness (Bartlett and Youngner\n1988, 205\u20136). If total brain failure is supposed to be\nsufficient for death, and if this is true only because the\nformer entails the loss of somatic functioning integrated by the\nbrain, then the loss of those functions should also be sufficient for\ndeath. But these patients, who are clearly alive, show that this is\nnot so. Either the whole-brain definition must be rejected or\nthis particular reason for accepting the whole-brain approach must be\nrejected and some other good reason for accepting it found.\n\nRecently, a new rationale\u2014distinct from the one that understands\nhuman death in terms of loss of organismic functioning mediated by the\nbrain\u2014has been advanced in support of the whole-brain standard\n(PCB 2008, ch. 4). According to this rationale, a human being dies\nupon irreversibly losing the capacity to perform the fundamental\nwork of an organism, a loss that occurs with total brain failure.\nThe fundamental work of an organism is characterized as follows: (1)\nreceptivity to stimuli from the surrounding environment; (2) the\nability to act upon the world to obtain, selectively, what the\norganism needs; and (3) the basic felt need that drives the organism\nto act as it must to obtain what it needs and what its receptivity\nreveals to be available (ibid, 61). According to a sympathetic reading\nof the ambiguous discussion in which this analysis is advanced, any\npatient who meets even one of these criteria is alive and therefore\nnot dead. A patient with total brain failure meets none of these\ncriteria, even if a respirator permits the continuation of\ncardiopulmonary function. By contrast, PVS patients meet at least the\nsecond criterion through spontaneous respiration (a kind of acting\nupon the world to obtain what is needed: oxygen); and locked-in\npatients meet the first criterion if they can see or experience bodily\nsensation and certainly meet the third insofar as they are conscious.\nOne difficulty with this \u201cfundamental work\u201d rationale for\nthe whole-brain standard, a rationale that is intended to capture\n\u201cwhat distinguishes every organism from non-living things\u201d\n(ibid), is that some present-day robots, which are certainly not alive,\nseem to satisfy the first two criteria. If one insisted, contrary to\nthe reading deemed sympathetic, that a being must satisfy all three\ncriteria\u2014as robots do not since they lack felt needs\u2014in\norder to qualify as living, the same may be asserted not only of\ninsentient animal life but also of presentient human fetuses and of\nunconscious human beings of any age. Another difficulty of the\n\u201cfundamental work\u201d rationale for the whole brain standard is that it\nwas intended to replace the idea that integrated functional unity\nwithin an organism is what constitutes life\u2014but the latter idea\nis extremely plausible and helps to explain what any \u201cfundamental\nwork\u201d would be working toward (cf. Thomas 2012, 105). Whether any variation\nor modification of the present rationale for the whole-brain standard\ncan survive critical scrutiny remains an open question.\n\nSome traditional defenders of the cardiopulmonary approach believe\nthat the insufficiency of whole-brain criteria for death is evident\nnot only in exceptional cases, such as those described earlier, but in\nall cases in which patients with total brain failure exhibit\nrespirator-assisted cardiopulmonary function. Anyone who is breathing\nand whose heart functions cannot be dead, they claim. The champion of\nwhole-brain criteria may retort that such a body is not really\nbreathing and circulating blood; the respirator is doing the work. The\ntraditionalist, in response, will likely contend that what is\nimportant is not who or what is powering the breathing and heartbeat,\njust that they occur. Even complete dependence on external support for\nvital functions cannot entail that one is dead, the traditionalist\nwill continue, as is evident in the fact that living fetuses are\nentirely dependent on their mothers' bodies; nor can complete\ndependence on mechanical support entail that one is dead, as is\nevident in the fact that many living people are utterly dependent on\npacemakers.\n\nA third major criticism of the whole-brain approach\u2014at least in\nits legally authoritative formulation in the United\nStates\u2014concerns its conceptual and clinical adequacy. The\nwhole-brain standard, taken at its word, requires for human death\npermanent cessation of all brain functions. Yet many patients\nwho meet routine clinical tests for this standard continue to have\nminor brain functions such as electroencephalographic activity,\nisolated nests of living neurons, and hypothalamic functioning (see,\ne.g., Potts 2001, 482; Veatch 1993, 18; Nair-Collins and Miller\nforthcoming). Indeed, the latter, which controls neurohormonal\nregulation, is indisputably an\nintegrating function of the brain (Brody 1999, 73). Now one\ncould maintain the coherence of the whole-brain approach by insisting\nthat the individuals in question are not really dead and that\nphysicians ought to use more thorough clinical tests before declaring\ndeath (see, e.g., Capron 1999, 130\u2013131). But whole-brain\ntheorists tend to agree that these individuals are dead\u2014that the\nresidual functions are too trivial to count against a judgment of\ndeath (see, e.g., President's Commission 1981, 28\u201329; Bernat\n1992, 25)\u2014suggesting that the problem lies with the formulation\nof the whole-brain standard rather than with its spirit.\n\nWithin this spirit and in response to this challenge, a leading\nproponent of the whole-brain approach has revised both (1) the\norganismic definition of death to \u201cthe permanent cessation of\nthe critical functions of the organism as a whole\u201d and\n(2) the corresponding standard to permanent cessation of the\ncritical functions of the whole brain (Bernat 1998, 17). The\norganism's critical functions may be identified by reference to its\nemergent functions\u2014that is, properties of the whole\norganism that are not possessed by any of its component parts\u2014as\nfollows: \u201cThe irretrievable loss of the organism's emergent\nfunctions produces loss of the critical functioning of the organism as\na whole and therefore is the death of the organism,\u201d (Bernat\n2006, 38). The emphasis on critical functions, of course, allows one\nto declare dead those patients with only trivial brain functions.\nAccording to this revised whole-brain approach, the critical functions\nof the organism are (1) the vital functions of spontaneous breathing\nand autonomic circulation control, (2) integrating functions that\nmaintain the organism's homeostasis, and (3) consciousness. A human\nbeing dies upon losing all three. Whether this or some similar\nmodification of the whole-brain approach adequately addresses the\npresent challenge is a topic of ongoing debate (see, e.g., Brody 1999,\nBernat 2006). What seems reasonably clear is that not all functions of\nthe brain will count equally in any cogent defense of the whole-brain\napproach.\n\nThe judgment that some brain functions are trivial in this context\ninvites a reconsideration of what is most significant about what the\nhuman brain does. According to an alternative approach, what is far\nand away most significant about human brain function is\nconsciousness.\n2. A Progressive Alternative: The Higher-Brain Approach\n\nAccording to the higher-brain standard, human death is the\nirreversible cessation of the capacity for consciousness.\n\u201cConsciousness\u201d here is meant broadly, to include any\nsubjective experience, so that both wakeful and dreaming states count\nas instances. Reference to the capacity for consciousness\nindicates that individuals who retain intact the neurological hardware\nneeded for consciousness, including individuals in a dreamless sleep\nor reversible coma, are alive. One dies on this view upon entering a\nstate in which the brain is incapable of returning to consciousness.\nThis implies, somewhat radically, that a patient in a PVS or irreversible\ncoma is dead despite continued brainstem function that permits\nspontaneous cardiopulmonary function. Although no jurisdiction has\nadopted the higher-brain standard, it enjoys the support of many\nscholars (see, e.g., Veatch 1975; Engelhardt 1975; Green and Wikler\n1980; Gervais 1986; Bartlett and Youngner 1988; Puccetti 1988; Rich\n1997; and Baker 2000). These scholars conceptualize, or define, human\ndeath in different ways\u2014though in each case as the irreversible\nloss of some property for which the capacity for consciousness is\nnecessary. This discussion will consider four leading argumentative\nstrategies in support of the higher-brain approach.\n2.1 Appeals to the Essence of Human Persons\n\nOne strategy for defending the higher-brain approach is to appeal to\nthe essence of human persons on the understanding that this essence\nrequires the capacity for consciousness (see, e.g., Bartlett and\nYoungner 1988; Veatch 1993; Engelhardt 1996, 248; Rich 1997; and Baker\n2000, 5). \u201cEssence\u201d here is intended in a strict\nontological sense: that property or set of properties of an individual\nthe loss of which would necessarily terminate the individual's\nexistence. From this perspective, we human persons\u2014more\nprecisely, we individuals who are at any time human persons\u2014are\nessentially beings with the capacity for consciousness such\nthat we cannot exist at any time without having this capacity at that\ntime. We go out of existence, it is assumed, when we die, so death\ninvolves the loss of what is essential to our existence.\n\nUnfortunately, the use of terminology in these arguments can be\nconfusing because the same term may be used in different ways and\nterms are frequently used without precise definition. It is sometimes\nclaimed, for example, that we are essentially persons. But\nwhat, exactly, is a person? Some authors (e.g., Engelhardt 1996, Baker\n2000) use the term to refer to beings with relatively complex\npsychological capacities such as self-awareness over time, reason, and\nmoral agency. Then the claim that we are essentially persons implies\nthat we die upon losing such advanced capacities. But this means that\nat some point during the normal course of progressive\ndementia the demented individual dies\u2014upon losing complex\npsychological capacities, however these are defined\u2014despite\nthe fact that a patient remains, clearly alive, with the capacity for\n(basic) consciousness. This view is extraordinarily radical and\nappears inconsistent with the higher-brain approach, which equates\ndeath with the irreversible loss of the capacity for (any) consciousness.\nA proponent of the view that we are essentially persons in the present\nsense, however, may hold that practical considerations\u2014such as\nthe impossibility of drawing a clear line between sentient persons and\nsentient nonpersons, and the potential for abuse of the\nelderly\u2014recommend the capacity for consciousness as the only\nsafe line to draw, thereby vindicating the higher-brain view\n(Engelhardt 1996, 250). Meanwhile, other proponents of the view that\nwe are essentially persons (e.g., Bartlett and Youngner 1988)\napparently hold that any member of our species who retains the\ncapacity for consciousness qualifies as a person. This view, unlike\nthe previous one, straightforwardly supports the higher-brain\nstandard. Still other authors (e.g., Veatch 1993) hold that we are\nessentially human beings where this term refers not to all\nmembers of our species but just to those judged to be persons by the\nprevious group of authors: members of our species who have the\ncapacity for consciousness. And some authors who defend the\nhigher-brain standard (e.g., McMahan 2002) assert that we are\nessentially minds or minded beings, which is to say\nbeings with the capacity for consciousness. In each case, an appeal to\nour essence is advanced to support the higher-brain standard.\n\nTaking this collection of arguments together, the reasoning might be\nreconstructed as follows:\n\nFor humans, the irreversible loss of the capacity for\nconsciousness entails (is sufficient for) the loss of what is\nessential to their existence;\nFor humans, loss of what is essential to their existence is (is\nnecessary and sufficient for) death;\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nFor humans, irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness\nentails (is sufficient for) death.\n\n\nWe have noted that various commentators who advance this reasoning\nhold that we are essentially persons in a sense requiring complex\npsychological capacities. We have noted that this implies that for\nthose of us who become progressively demented, we die\u2014go out of\nexistence\u2014at some point during the gradual slide to\npermanent unconsciousness. Even if practical considerations recommend\nsafely drawing a line at irreversible loss of the capacity of\nconsciousness for policy purposes, the implication that, strictly\nspeaking, we go out of existence during progressive dementia\nwill strike many as incredible. At the other end of life there is\nanother problematic implication. For if we are essentially persons (in\nthis sense), then inasmuch as human newborns lack the capacities that\nconstitute personhood, each of us came into existence after\nwhat is ordinarily described as his or her birth.\n\nFor those attracted to the general approach of understanding our\nessence in terms of psychological capacities, a promising alternative\nthesis is that we are essentially beings with the capacity for at\nleast some form of consciousness who die upon irreversibly losing that\nvery basic capacity. Stated more simply, we are essentially minded\nbeings, or minds, and we die when we completely \u201close our\nminds.\u201d (Note that this thesis is consistent with the claim that\nwe are also essentially embodied.)\n\nWhat, then, about the human organism associated with one of us minded\nbeings? Surely the fetus that gradually developed prior to the\nemergence of sentience or the capacity for consciousness\u2014that\nis, prior to the emergence of a mind\u2014was alive. On the other end\nof life, a patient in a PVS who is spontaneously breathing,\ncirculating blood, and exhibiting a full range of brainstem reflexes\nappears to be alive. Consider also anencephalic infants, who are born\nwithout cerebral hemispheres and never have the capacity for\nconsciousness: They, too, seem to be living organisms, their grim\nprognosis notwithstanding. In response to this challenge, a proponent\nof the higher-brain approach may either (1) assert that the\npresentient fetus, PVS patient, and anencephalic infant are not alive\ndespite appearances (Puccetti 1988) or (2) allow that these organisms\nare alive but are not of the same fundamental kind as we are: minded\nbeings (McMahan 2002, 423\u20136). Insofar as life is a biological\nconcept, and the organisms in question satisfy commonly accepted\ncriteria for life, option (1) seems at best hyperbolic. At best, the\nclaim is really that these organisms, though alive, are not alive in\nany state that matters much, so we may count them as dead or nonliving\nfor our purposes. This claim, in turn, may be understood as depending\non option (2), on which we may focus. This option implies that for\neach of us minded beings, there is a second, closely associated being:\na human organism. The prospects of the present strategy for defending\nthe higher-brain approach turn significantly on its ability to make\nsense of this picture of two closely associated beings: (1) the\norganism, which comes into existence at conception or shortly\nthereafter (perhaps after twinning is no longer possible) and dies\nwhen organismic functioning radically breaks down, and (2) the minded\nbeing, who comes into existence when sentience emerges and\nmight\u2014in the event of PVS or irreversible coma\u2014die before the\norganism does. (For doubts on this score, see DeGrazia 2005, ch.\n2).\n\nAppealing to the authority of biologists and common sense, some\nphilosophers (e.g., Olson 1997) charge as indefensible the claim that\nwe (who are now) human persons were never presentient fetuses. One\nmight also find puzzling the thesis that there is one definition of\ndeath, appealing to the capacity for consciousness, for human beings\nor persons and another definition, appealing to organismic\nfunctioning, for nonhuman animals and the human organisms associated\nwith persons. It is open to the higher-brain theorist, however, to\nallow that there are also two closely associated beings in the case of\nsentient nonhuman animals\u2014the minded being and the\norganism\u2014with the death of, say, Lassie (the minded dog)\noccurring at her irreversible loss of consciousness (McMahan 2002, ch.\n1). But some will find unattractive the failure to furnish a single\nconception of death that applies to all living things. To be sure, not\neveryone finds these objections compelling.\n\nOne of the most significant challenges confronting the present\napproach is to characterize cogently the relationship between one of\nus and the associated human organism. The relationship is clearly not\nidentity\u2014that is, being one and the same\nthing\u2014because the organism originates before the mind, might\noutlive the mind, and therefore has different persistence conditions.\nThis strongly suggests, perhaps surprisingly, that we human persons\nare not animals. If you are not identical to the human organism\nassociated with you, then since there is at most one animal sitting in\nyour chair, you are not she and are therefore not an animal (Olson\n1997). Yet many consider it part of educated common sense that we are\nanimals.\n\nMight you be part of the organism associated with\nyou\u2014namely, the brain (more precisely, the portions of the brain\nassociated with consciousness) (McMahan 2002, ch. 1)? But the brain\nseems capable of surviving death, when you are supposed to go out of\nexistence. Are you then a functioning brain, which goes out\nof existence at the irreversible loss of consciousness? But it seems\nodd to identify the functioning brain\u2014as distinct from\nthe brain\u2014as you. How could you be some organ only when it\nfunctions? Presumably you are a substance (see the entry on\n substance),\n a bearer of properties, not a substance only when it has certain\nproperties. One might reply that the functioning brain is itself\na substance, a substance distinct from the brain, but that, too,\nstrains credibility. Might you instead be not the brain, but the mind\nunderstood as the conscious properties of the brain? That\nwould imply that you are a set of properties, rather than a substance,\nwhich is no less counterintuitive. Note that the charge of\nincredibility is not directed at the assertion that the mind\nis the functioning brain, or is a set of brain properties, and not a\ndistinct substance\u2014a thesis in good standing in the philosophy\nof mind (see the entries on\n identity theory of mind\n and\n functionalism).\n The charge of incredibility is directed at the assertion that\nyou are a set of properties and not a\n substance.[2]\n\nAnother possibility regarding the person/organism relationship is that\nthe human organism constitutes the person it eventually comes\nto support (Baker 2000). One might even claim the legitimacy of\nsaying\u2014employing an \u201cis\u201d of constitution\u2014that\nwe are animals (or organisms), just as we can say that a\nstatue constituted by a hunk of bronze, shaped in a particular way, is\na hunk of bronze (ibid). Challenges to this reasoning includes doubts\nthat we may legitimately speak of an \u201cis\u201d of constitution;\nif not, then the constitution view implies that we are not animals\nafter all. Another challenge, which applies equally to the view that\nwe minds are parts of organisms, concerns the counting of conscious\nbeings. On either the constitution view or the part-whole view, you\nare essentially a being with the capacity for consciousness. Closely\nassociated with you\u2014without being (identical to) you, due to\ndifferent persistence conditions\u2014is a particular animal. But\nthat animal, having a functioning brain, would also seem to be a\nconscious being. Either of these views, then, apparently suggests that\nfor each of us there are two conscious beings, seemingly one too many.\nDespite such difficulties as these, the thesis that we are essentially\nminded beings remains a significant basis for the higher-brain approach to human death.\n2.2 Appeals to Personal Identity\n\nA second argumentative strategy in defense of the higher-brain\napproach claims to appeal to our personal identity while remaining\nagnostic on the question of our essence (Green and Wikler 1980).\nThe fundamental claim is that, whatever we are essentially, it is\nclear that one of us has gone out of existence once the capacity for\nconsciousness has been irreversibly lost, supporting the higher-brain\nstandard of death. Clearly, though, any view of our numerical identity\nover time\u2014our persistence conditions\u2014is conceptually\ndependent on a view of what we essentially are (DeGrazia 1999;\nDeGrazia 2005, ch. 4). If we are essentially human animals, and not\nessentially beings with psychological capacities, then, contrary to\nthe above argument, it is not clear\u2014indeed, it is\nfalse\u2014that we go out of existence upon irreversible loss of the\ncapacity for consciousness; rather, we die upon the collapse of\norganismic functioning. The appeal to personal identity in support of\nthe higher-brain standard depends on the thesis that we are\nessentially minded beings and therefore inherits the challenges facing\nthis view, as discussed in the previous subsection. Nevertheless, the\nappeal to personal identity, construed as a distinct argumentative\nstrategy, was somewhat influential in early discussions of the definition of death (see, e.g., President's\nCommission 1981, 38\u20139).\n2.3 The Claim that the Definition of Death is a Moral Issue\n\nAnother prominent argumentative strategy in support of the\nhigher-brain approach contends that the definition of death is a\nmoral issue and that confronting it as such vindicates the\nhigher-brain approach (see, e.g., Veatch 1975, 1993; Gervais\n1986, ch. 6). In asking how to determine that a human has died,\naccording to this argument, what we are really asking is when we ought\nto discontinue certain activities such as life-support efforts and\ninitiate certain other activities such as organ donation, burial or\ncremation, grieving, change of a survivor's marital status, and\ntransfer of property. The question, in other words, is when\n\u201cdeath behaviors\u201d are appropriate. This, the argument\ncontinues, is a moral question, so an answer to this question should\nbe moral as well. Understood thus, the issue of defining human death\nis best addressed with the recognition that irreversible loss of the\ncapacity for consciousness marks the time at which it is appropriate\nto commence death behaviors.\n\nIs the definition of death really a moral issue? To say that someone\nhas died does seem tantamount to saying that certain behaviors are now\nappropriate while certain others are no longer appropriate. But it\nhardly follows that the assertion of death is itself a moral claim. An\nalternative hypothesis is that the sense of moral import derives from\nthe fact that certain moral premises\u2014for example, that we\nshouldn't bury or cremate prior to death\u2014are shared by virtually\neveryone. Moreover, the concept of death is (at least originally) at\nhome in biology, which offers many instances in which a determination\nof death\u2014say, of a gnat or a clover\u2014seems morally\nunimportant. Rather than asserting that death itself is a moral\nconcept, it might be more plausible to assert that death, a biological\nphenomenon, is generally assumed to be morally important\u2014at\nleast in the case of human beings\u2014given a relatively stable\nbackground of social institutions and attitudes about \u201cdeath\nbehaviors.\u201d Furthermore, due to the moral salience of human\ndeath, discussions about its determination are often prompted by a\nmoral or pragmatic agenda such as interest in organ transplantation or\nconcerns about expensive, futile treatment. But these observations do\nnot imply that death is itself a moral concept.\n\nEven if it were, it would hardly follow that the higher-brain standard\nis preferable to other standards. A person with relatively\nconservative instincts might hold that death behaviors are morally\nappropriate only when the whole-brain or cardiopulmonary standard has\nbeen met. We need to ask, therefore, what grounds exist for the\nclaim\u2014advanced by proponents of the higher-brain\nstandard\u2014that death behaviors are appropriate as soon as someone\nhas irreversibly lost the capacity for consciousness. Perhaps the best\npossible grounds are that irreversible loss of consciousness entails\nan existence lacking in value for the unconscious individual\nherself. It appears, then, that the strongest specification of\nthe present line of reasoning actually relies upon the next (and\nfinal) argumentative strategy to be considered\u2014and might, as we\nwill see, lead to the conclusion that we should permit individuals to\nselect among several standards of death.\n2.4 The Appeal to Prudential Value\n\nThe idea here is to defend the higher-brain approach on the basis of\nclaims about prudential value (for a discussion, see DeGrazia 2005,\n134\u20138). Conscious life, it is argued, is a precondition for\nvirtually everything that we value in our lives. We have an enormous\nstake in continuing our lives as persons and little or no stake in\ncontinuing them when we are permanently unconscious. The capacity for\nconsciousness is therefore essential not in a metaphysical\nsense connected to our persistence conditions, but in the evaluative\nsense of indispensable to us. One need not claim that the\ncapacity for consciousness underlies everything of prudential value,\njust that it underlies the overwhelmingly greater part of what matters\nto us prudentially. And although, for many people, consciousness may\nnot be sufficient for what matters prudentially\u2014insofar\nas they find indispensable, say, some degree of self-awareness and\nmeaningful interaction with others\u2014it is certainly necessary;\nand the basic capacity for consciousness (as opposed to\nself-consciousness or personhood) is the only safe place to demarcate\ndeath for policy and social purposes. We should therefore regard\nirreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness as a human being's\ndeath\u2014even if the original concept of death is biological and\nbiological considerations favor some less progressive standard.\n\nHow persuasive is this case for the higher-brain approach? One might\nchallenge the assumption that prudential, as opposed to moral,\nconsiderations ought to be decisive in adopting a standard for human\ndeath. On the other hand, as suggested in our discussion of the\nprevious argumentative strategy, moral considerations may not favor a\nparticular standard of death except insofar as they rest on prudential\nconsiderations\u2014our present concern. But even if we accept the\nclaim that human death should be understood on the basis of prudential\nvalues, we confront the prospect of reasonable pluralism about\nprudential value. While supporters of the higher-brain approach (who\ntend to be liberal intellectuals) are likely to have prudential values\nin line with this approach, many other people do not. If a patient has\na stake in his family's need for closure should he enter a\nPVS\u2014an interest that may be self-regarding as well as\nother-regarding\u2014this fact would count against allowing the PVS\nto constitute death in his case. If an Orthodox Jew or conservative\nChristian believes that (biological) life is inherently precious to\nits possessor, even if the individual cannot appreciate its value at a\ngiven time, this would count against the higher-brain standard in the\ncase of the individual in question. Perhaps, then, the appeal to\nprudential value favors not the higher-brain standard for everyone but\na pro-choice view about standards of death. A jurisdiction\nmight, for example, have one default standard of death but permit\nconscientious exemption from that standard and selection of a\ndifferent one within some reasonable range of options (Veatch 2019).\n\nIn reply to this argument, a proponent of the appeal to prudential\nvalue might contend that it is simply irrational to value biological\nexistence without the possibility of returning to consciousness. But\nthis reply assumes the experience requirement: that only\nstates of affairs that affect one's experience can affect one's\nwell-being (for a discussion, see Griffin 1986, 16\u201319). The\nexperience requirement is not self-evident. Some people believe that\nthey are worse off for being slandered even if they never learn of the\nslander and its repercussions never affect their experience. Some even\nbelieve, following Aristotle's suggestion, that the quality of one's\nlife as a whole can be affected by posthumous states of affairs such\nas tragedy befalling a loved one. Although the intelligibility of this\nbelief in posthumous interests might be challenged, the following is\nsurely intelligible: States of affairs that don't affect one's\nexperience but connect importantly with one's values can affect one's\ninterests at least while one exists. Desire-based accounts of\nwell-being (see, e.g., Hare 1981) standardly accept this principle,\nfor what is desired may occur without one's awareness of its\noccurrence and without affecting one's experience. These\nconsiderations illuminate the intelligibility of one's prudential\nvalues extending to a period of time when one is alive but\nirreversibly unconscious.\n\nIn view of apparently reasonable pluralism regarding prudential\nvalues, including reasonable disagreement about the experience\nrequirement, it seems doubtful that appeal to prudential value alone\ncan support the higher-brain standard for everyone. At the same time,\nand more generally, the higher-brain approach remains an important\ncontender in the debate over the definition of death.\n3. A Proposed Return to Tradition: An Updated Cardiopulmonary Approach\n\nPrior to the brain-death movement, death was traditionally understood\nalong the lines of the cardiopulmonary standard: death as the\nirreversible cessation of cardiopulmonary function. In the\nsupportive background of this consensus on the cardiopulmonary\nstandard hovered several general definitions or conceptualizations of\ndeath. Some champions of the traditional standard (e.g., Becker 1975)\nhave conceptualized death in the same organismic terms that proponents\nof the whole-brain standard invoke: death as the irreversible\ncessation of functioning of the organism as a whole. Other champions\nof tradition have conceptualized death in more spiritual terms such as\nthe departure of the animating (or vital) principle or\nloss of the soul.\n\nIn determining whether someone was dead, one could check for a pulse,\nmoisture on a mirror held in front of the mouth, or other indications\nthat the heart and lungs were working. Before the development of\nrespirators and other modern life-supports, a working heart and lungs\nindicated continuing brainstem function. As we have seen, however,\nmodern life-supports permitted cardiopulmonary function without brain\nfunction, setting up a competition between traditional and whole-brain\ncriteria for determining death. Although, as noted above, the\nwhole-brain approach achieved near-consensus status, this approach is\nincreasingly questioned and faces significant difficulties. Its\ndifficulties and those facing the more radical higher-brain\nalternative have contributed to renewed interest in the traditional\napproach.\n\nFurther contributing to renewed interest in the traditional\napproach\u2014and warranting a brief digression\u2014is an approach\nto organ donation that capitalizes on the fact that current American\nlegal standards for death are disjunctive, permitting satisfaction of\neither the whole-brain standard or the cardiopulmonary standard,\nwhichever applies first, for a declaration of death. This approach to\norgan donation, called donation after cardiac death (DCD) or\nnon-heart-beating organ donation, was very rare until\ninstituted with much publicity by the University of Pittsburgh in the\nearly 1990s in response to a perception that awaiting a neurological\ndetermination of death for (heart-beating, respirator-maintained)\norgan donors was insufficient to meet the demand for viable organs. In\nthe Pittsburgh program, a respirator-dependent patient who had\npreviously agreed to forgo life supports and donate vital organs is\ntaken to an operating room and disconnected from the respirator,\nleading predictably to cardiac arrest. Two minutes after cardiac\narrest, the patient is declared dead on the basis of the\ncardiopulmonary standard: \u201cirreversible cessation of circulatory\nand respiratory functions.\u201d This procedure allows organ\nprocurement to commence very shortly after cardiac arrest, providing\nrelatively fresh organs for transplant. (Organs, of course, would not\nbe viable if medical staff awaited a declaration of total brain\nfailure\u2014which requires confirmatory tests hours after initial\ntests\u2014in the patients in question, who will not incur total\nbrain failure unless respirator support is discontinued.)\n\nThe practice of DCD, which has expanded to several medical centers,\nhas provoked considerable controversy. Critics have charged that in\nDCD vital organs are removed before patients are really dead, implying\nthat organ procurement kills the patients. Some proponents of the\nwhole-brain approach argue that the patients are not yet dead because\nonly total brain failure (or perhaps that of the brainstem)\nconstitutes human death. But current American law in its disjunctive form\nsuggests otherwise\u2014at least for legal purposes. Other critics of\nDCD charge that a patient cannot be dead two minutes after cardiac\narrest because the loss of cardiopulmonary functioning is not\nirreversible: Victims of heart attack are sometimes revived more than\ntwo minutes after the arrest. One might reply that the loss of\nfunctioning is irreversible because, the patient having requested\nremoval of life supports, no one may violate the patient's\nrights by resuscitating him or her (Tomlinson 1993). It seems fair to\nreply, however, that a decision not to resuscitate does not mean that\nresuscitation is impossible as suggested by the concept of\nirreversibility. Has the latter concept been conflated in DCD\nwith the concept of permanence? Permanent loss of function\ndoes not imply that resuscitation is impossible, just that it will not\n occur.[3]\n These concerns about abandoning the standard of irreversible loss of\ncardiopulmonary function apply even to more modest proposals, such as\nthat advanced by the Institute of Medicine (2000), in which a\ndeclaration of death and DCD proceed after a waiting period of\nfive minutes: Resuscitation is sometimes possible more than\nfive minutes after a heart attack. Proponents of DCD might reply that\npermanence, rather than irreversibility, is the appropriate standard\nin this context (see, e.g., Bernat 2006, 41) or that DCD represents an\ninstance where it is permissible to remove vital organs from someone\nwho is dying but not yet dead. Certainly, any proponent of DCD will\nsee the current law's (disjunctive) acceptance of cardiopulmonary\ncriteria for death as offering a major practical advantage over any\npolicy that accepted only whole-brain criteria.\n\nWe return to the view of those who champion only the\ncardiopulmonary standard. Proponents of this approach believe that it\ncorrectly implies, contrary to competing standards, that a human body\nthat is breathing and maintaining circulation is alive regardless of\nwhether continuation of these functions requires external support (as\nwith \u201cbrain-dead\u201d patients, locked-in patients, and normal\nfetuses) (Shewmon 2001; Potts 2001). At the same time, the usual\ncharacterization of the traditional approach is problematic in\nsuggesting that the difference between human life and death comes down\nto the state of two organs: heart and lungs. This reductionistic\npicture arguably obscures the holistic nature of bodily\nfunctioning.\n\nA more realistic picture, some argue, features integrative unity as\nexisting diffusely throughout the organism. As a leading proponent\nputs it, \u201cWhat is of the essence of integrative unity is neither\nlocalized nor replaceable: namely the anti-entropic mutual interaction\nof all the cells and tissues of the body, mediated in mammals by\ncirculating oxygenated blood\u201d (Shewmon 2001, 473). On this view,\nthe brain, like the heart and lungs, is a very important component of\nthe interaction among body systems, but is not the supremely important\nintegrator as suggested by the (mainstream) whole-brain approach. Nor\nis the functioning of other organs and bodily systems passively\ndependent on the brain. The brain's capacity to augment other systems\npresupposes their preexisting capacity to function. This is true even\nof a brain function as somatically integrating as the maintenance of\nbody temperature: the \u201cthermostat\u201d may be in the brain,\nbut the \u201cfurnace\u201d is the energy metabolism diffused\nthroughout the body. If not covered with blankets, brain-dead bodies\nmaintained on respirators will grow colder\u2014but not comparably to\ncorpses (ibid, 471).\n\nAlthough a realistic picture of organismic functioning must be\nholistic, according to this updated traditional approach, it should\nalso portray certain functions as central. Tradition is correct that\nrespiration and circulation are especially crucial, but respiration is\nnot simply lung function and circulation is not just a working heart.\nBoth organs, after all, can be artificially replaced as the organism\nmaintains integrated functioning. Respiration and circulation occur\nthroughout the body as oxygenated blood circulates to different organs\nand bodily systems\u2014a condition necessary and sufficient for the\nintegrated organismic functioning that constitutes life. Unlike\nwhole-brain and higher-brain death, loss of respiration and\ncirculation leads relentlessly to the breakdown of cells, tissues,\norgans, bodily systems, and eventually the organism as a whole. Hence\nan updated traditional standard, which we might call the\ncirculatory-respiratory standard: death as the\nirreversible cessation of circulatory-respiratory\nfunction.\n\nThe chief advantage of such an updated traditional approach, according\nto proponents, is that it most adequately characterizes the difference\nbetween life and death\u2014where the latter is understood in terms\nof organismic functioning\u2014in a full range of cases. Such cases\ninclude several that the whole-brain and higher-brain standards handle\nless plausibly such as prenatal human organisms prior to brain\ndevelopment as well as locked-in patients and \u201cbrain-dead\u201d\nindividuals whose vital functions are maintained with mechanical\nassistance. The present approach also avoids some of the conceptual\nproblems facing the higher-brain approach, as discussed earlier.\n\nNevertheless, the traditional approach, whether updated or not, faces\nsignificant issues. One concern is that the approach overemphasizes\nour biological nature, suggesting we are nothing more than organisms,\nand by demoting the brain from prominence underemphasizes the mental\nlife that is generally thought to distinguish our species from others.\nWe human beings are not merely organisms or animals, the argument\ncontinues; we are also (after normal development) conscious beings and\npersons whose nature, one might say, is to transcend nature with\nculture. Our conception of human death should be faithful to a species\nself-image that does justice not only to our animality but also to our\npersonhood (cf. Pallis 1999, 96).\n\nWhole-brain (or brainstem) theorists and higher-brain theorists will\nextend this line of argument in different directions. The higher-brain\ntheorist will suggest that our capacity for consciousness, a\nprecondition for higher capacities and personhood, is so important\nthat permanent loss of the basic capacity should count as death. The\nwhole-brain theorist who develops the present line of reasoning will\nmaintain greater contact with the organismic conception of death,\nstressing the brainstem's role in integrating vital functions and\nclaiming either that (a) consciousness is a critical function of the\norganism, permitting it to interact adaptively to its environment\n(Bernat 1998), (b) consciousness is a characteristic aspect of the\nfundamental work of organisms like us, or (c) consciousness is crucial\nto our personhood, a feature no less important to what we are than our\nanimality. The latter option, in effect, would move the whole-brain\ntheorist to a dual-aspect understanding of human nature, as just\ndiscussed: human persons as essentially both persons\nand animals (cf. Schechtman 2014).\n\nA second major challenge confronting any traditional approach is the\nspecter of highly unpalatable practical consequences (Magnus, Wilfond, and Caplan 2014). Currently the\nwhole-brain standard is enshrined in law. Suppose we reversed\nlegislative course and returned to traditional criteria (whether\nupdated in formulation or not). Then a patient who satisfied\nwhole-brain criteria but not traditional criteria would count as alive. Unless we overturned the\n\u201cdead-donor rule\u201d\u2014the policy of permitting\nextraction of vital organs only from dead bodies\u2014then it would\nbe illegal to procure organs from these living patients who have\nincurred total brain failure; yet the viability of their organs would\nrequire maintaining respiration and circulation with life-supports.\nThere is broad agreement that having to wait until traditional\ncriteria are met to harvest organs would constitute a great setback to\norgan transplantation (even if donation after cardiac death, which\ninvokes traditional criteria, is permitted). Moreover, a legal return\nto traditional criteria for death might lead physicians to feel they\nhad lost the authority to discontinue treatment\nunilaterally\u2014when a family requests continued\ntreatment\u2014upon a determination of total brain failure despite\nwhat many would consider the futility of further treatment.\nFurthermore, laws for determining death would have to be revised.\n\nA defender of tradition might respond that we can avoid most of these\nunsavory consequences while legally adopting traditional criteria for\ndetermining death (see, e.g., DeGrazia 2005, 152\u20138). We could,\nfor one thing, abandon the dead-donor rule, permitting the harvesting\nof vital organs when authorized by appropriate prospective consent of\nthe donor even though taking the organs, by causing the donor's death,\nwould instantiate killing (Truog and Robinson 2003; Sade 2011). We\ncould also authorize physicians\u2014through hospital policies,\nprofessional guidelines, or laws\u2014to withdraw\nlife-supports unilaterally upon a declaration of total brain failure (perhaps even\nupon a determination of irreversible unconsciousness) in cases where\ncontinued treatment is unnecessary for organ procurement and appears\notherwise futile. Not all of what are traditionally considered\n\u201cdeath behaviors\u201d need to be permanently anchored to a\ndeclaration of death. Thus we currently use advance directives and\nother considerations to justify withdrawal of life-supports in some\ncircumstances, although several decades ago such withdrawal had to\nawait a determination of death. There is no reason to regard further\nreforms of our practices surrounding death as beyond responsible\nconsideration. Thus, despite rowing against the tide of the\nbrain-death movement, the traditional approach has reclaimed the\nstatus of a serious contender in the debate over the definition of\ndeath.\n4. Further Possibilities\n\nIn recent decades, the debate over the definition of death has\ngenerally been understood as a competition between the approaches\ndiscussed here: traditional, whole-brain (or brainstem), and\nhigher-brain standards and their corresponding conceptualizations.\nEach of these approaches, however, makes certain assumptions that\nmight be contested: (1) that death is more or less determinate, more\nevent-like than process-like, (2) that there is a uniquely correct\ndefinition of death, which can be formulated in terms of necessary and\njointly sufficient conditions, and (3) that human death is morally a\nvery important marker. Now we will consider three nonstandard ways of\nthinking about death, each of which directly challenges one of these\nassumptions.\n4.1 Death as a Process, Not a Determinate Event\n\nEach of the approaches considered so far asserts the correctness of a\nsingle standard of death. Might different standards be appropriate for\ndifferent purposes? If so, then the debate characterized in previous\nsections has reflected, to some extent, an exercise in futility: a\nsearch that wrongly seeks a determinate event, which can be captured\nby a single standard, rather than a process.\n\nAccording to two authors who develop this line of reasoning, the\nnearly simultaneous emergence of organ transplantation and mechanical\nventilators provoked three practical questions: (1) When may doctors\ntake organs for transplantation? (2) When may doctors unilaterally\ndiscontinue treatment? (3) When is a patient dead for legal purposes\nand appropriately transferred to an undertaker? (Halevy and Brody\n1993). Rather than assuming that one standard for death will\nadequately answer these three questions\u2014a possibility rendered\ndoubtful by the interminable debate over standards\u2014we should\nanswer each question on its merits, disaggregating death\naccordingly.\n\nProviding one example of how these practical questions might be\nanswered, the authors argue that organ procurement is appropriate when\nthe whole-brain standard has been met (apparently precluding DCD),\nunilateral discontinuation of treatment is appropriate when the\nhigher-brain standard has been met, and a patient should legally count\nas dead when traditional criteria have been met (ibid). (Here we need\nnot consider the authors' specific arguments for these\ndeterminations.)\n\nBut why must each answer invoke a standard of death? An alternative\nwould be to adopt an updated traditional standard, which would supply\nlegal criteria for death, while denying that unilateral\ndiscontinuation of treatment and organ procurement must await death.\nTo be sure, harvesting vital organs from living patients would require\nan exception to the dead-donor rule, the social risks of which might\nwell be avoided if death were disaggregated along the lines suggested.\nBut the alternative possibility of separating death from particular\n\u201cdeath behaviors\u201d motivates the question of whether there\nare further grounds for disaggregating death into a process.\n\nA possible further ground is the thesis that life and death, although\nmutually exclusive states, are not exhaustive: \u201cAlthough no\norganism can fully belong to both sets [life and death], organisms can\nbe in many conditions (the very conditions that have created the\ndebates about death) during which they do not fully belong to either.\n\u2026 Death is a fuzzy set,\u201d (Brody 1999, 72). What are we to\nthink of this proposal?\n\nIt seems undeniable that the boundary between life and death is not\nperfectly \n sharp.[4] \n The specification of any\nstandard will require some arbitrary line-drawing. Operationalizing\nthe whole-brain standard requires a decision about which brain\nfunctions are too trivial to count and need not be tested for. Making\na traditional standard clinically useful requires a cut-off point of\nsome number of minutes without heartbeat or respiration for the loss\nof functioning to count as irreversible. A higher-brain approach needs\ncriteria for determining what sorts of brain damage constitute\nirreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness and which count as\nreversible. Yet, while some arbitrariness is inevitable, and\nhighlights a blurred boundary, the blurring in each instance concerns\nvery specific criteria and clinical tests for determining that a\nstandard has been met, not the standard itself. None of the blurred\nboundaries just considered is inconsistent with the claim that some\nstandard is uniquely correct. Moreover, if essentialism regarding\nhuman persons is true\u2014that is, if we human persons have an\nessence locating us in our most basic kind (e.g., animal, minded\nbeing)\u2014this would strengthen the case for a uniquely correct\nstandard by suggesting a foundation for one.\n\nBut we must consider the possibility that there is no correct\nstandard. Perhaps death is no more determinate than adulthood. Some\npeople are clearly adults and some people are clearly not adults. But,\nas any college professor knows, many people are ambiguously\nadults\u2014mature enough to count as adults in some ways but not in\nothers. Socially and legally, we treat 16-year-olds as adults for\npurposes of driving, 18-year-olds as adults for purposes of voting and\nbearing the full weight of criminal law, 21-year-olds as adult enough\nto drink alcoholic beverages, and so on. Nor is this disaggregation of\nadulthood incoherent or even particularly awkward; rather, it seems to\nfit the facts about the gradual development of maturity, acquisition\nof experience, and accumulation of birthdays. Disaggregating death,\none might argue, would be similarly faithful to facts about the\nfrequently very gradual demise of human persons.\n\nEven if this argument persuades us that death is more process-like\nthan event-like\u2014and to do this it must persuade us that it is\ndeath itself, not dying, that is process-like\u2014it does\nnot follow that we ought to draw several lines for the determination\nof death. Consider the confusion that would likely result from such\nstatements as \u201cGrandmother is partly dead, but less dead than\nGrandfather, although he's not fully dead.\u201d People are so\naccustomed to thinking of life and death as mutually exclusive,\nexhaustive sets that there would be considerable practical advantage\nin insisting on some sensible line that demarcates death in this way.\nIt is true that disaggregating adulthood poses no insuperable\npractical difficulties, but death is importantly different. For we\ngenerally assume that one goes out of existence (at least in this\nworld) at death, a rather momentous change with\u2014at least in the\nstatus quo\u2014far-reaching social and legal ramifications.\nConfusion as a result of plural lines for death may be more troubling\nand more likely, for the idea of someone's only partly existing is of\nquestionable intelligibility. On the other hand, a proponent of\ndisaggregating death might reply that (1) we could either reserve the\nlanguage of death for the traditional standard or get used to the\nlanguage of someone's being partially dead, and (2) we should\nappreciate that existence is sometimes partial as in the case\nof a half-assembled car.\n4.2 Death as a Cluster Concept not Amenable to Classical Definition\n\nMost discussions of the definition and determination of death assume\nthat there is a uniquely correct definition of death. Definitions,\nclassically understood, are supposed to state necessary and jointly\nsufficient conditions for the correct application of a word or\nconcept. They may be thought to capture de re essences\nexisting independently of human thought, language, and interests, or\nde dicto essences determined solely by linguistic meaning.\nThe major approaches we have considered have tried both to define\ndeath by capturing its essence and to advance a standard for\ndetermining human death that coheres with the definition. But what if\nthe term \u201cdeath\u201d cannot be defined in any such way?\n\nOne might insist that death can be defined, as the competing\ndefinitions demonstrate. But, of course, the trick is to define the\nterm adequately. For example, the organismic definition\u2014death as\nthe irreversible cessation of functioning of the organism as a\nwhole\u2014makes no reference to consciousness. Yet surely, one might\nargue, any organism that maintains consciousness should count as alive\neven if the organism as a whole has irreversibly ceased to function\n(whether or not this possibility is merely theoretical). Definitions\nassociated with the higher-brain approach\u2014such as human death as\nthe irreversible loss of mind\u2014implausibly imply that a PVS\npatient is dead despite exhibiting spontaneous breathing and\ncirculation, brainstem-mediated reflexes, and the like. The best\nexplanation for the shortcomings of leading efforts to define death,\nthe argument continues, is that death is not amenable to definition in\nterms of necessary and sufficient conditions (Chiong 2005). Let's\nconsider two distinct ways this thesis might be developed.\n\nFirst, one might argue that the concept of death exhibits only\n\u201cfamily resemblance\u201d relations among its instances, as\nWittgenstein argued was the case for the concepts of game,\nlanguage, and many others (Wittgenstein 1953). There are\nvarious features of an organism that count towards its being dead, yet\nthere is no authoritative list of features all of which must be\nsatisfied for it to be dead. Each of the following, for example, seems\nrelevant: unconsciousness, absence of spontaneous efforts to breathe,\nabsence of heartbeat, inertness, lack of integrated bodily functions,\nincapacity to grow, and physical decay. If all of these conditions are\npresent, an organism has surely died. But producing an authoritative\nshortlist of necessary and sufficient conditions seems futile. One\nscholar has advanced a parallel claim about the concept of life:\n\nWhen some property is central to the cluster\u2014as I've argued\nconsciousness is\u2014then possessing only this one property may be\nsufficient for membership in [the class of living things]. However,\nmerely possessing one or several properties that are peripheral to the\ncluster may not be sufficient for membership. [S]ome robots are\norganizationally complex and functionally responsive, though\nintuitively not alive (Chiong 2005, 26).\n\n\nAnother direction in which to take the thesis that death is not\namenable to classical definition is to argue that death is a natural\nkind whose essence may be obscure. Kripke influentially argued that\nnatural kinds\u2014kinds determined by nature rather than by human\nthinking, language, or interests\u2014often resist adequate\ndefinition because their essential features may be entirely unknown to\nthose referring to the kind in question (Kripke 1970). To define a\nterm by reference to the features people originally used to pick out\nthe kind in question won't do, because those features may be\naccidental, not essential, and speakers may even be mistaken about\nthem. Those naming the kind whale might have thought whales\nwere the largest fish in the ocean, but whales are not fish and their\nsize relative to other creatures is a contingent matter. We can refer\nmeaningfully to whales, to the creatures picked out by the term\nwhale (the name for the kind), without knowing the essential\nfeatures of whales, features likely to involve subtle biological\ndetails. Perhaps death, too, is a natural kind whose essence is\nobscure (a possibility entertained in Chiong 2005, 24\u201325). A\nlikely challenge to this argument is that we already know a great deal\nabout the physical processes involved in death, making it unlikely\nthat death has a hidden essence the failure to discover which impedes\nadequate definition.\n\nImportantly, though, one can claim that death is a natural kind\nwithout accepting any kind of essentialism. An alternative to the\nessentialist conception is the homeostatic property cluster theory of\nnatural kinds (Millikan 1999). On this view, natural kinds do not, or\nat least need not, share essential properties. They are comprised by\nmembers sharing a stable cluster of similarities, which are brought\nabout by \u201chomeostatic causal mechanisms\u201d (such as, in the\ncase of species, common developmental programs and selective\npressures). On this view, X (e.g., a fetus) might be a member of a\nnatural kind (e.g., our species) despite lacking one of the properties\n(e.g., the potential for rationality) among the cluster of\nsimilarities. Death and its opposite, life, might similarly be natural\nkinds lacking essences, each kind being associated with a cluster of\nproperties that tend to go together and support one another without\nbeing necessarily coinstantiated (see, e.g., Chiong 2005). If\nso, death cannot be defined in a set of necessary and sufficient\nconditions\u2014in which case no such definition can justify a\nparticular standard.\n\nIf death has no essence and resists definition, what is the upshot?\nOne possible inference\u2014that the boundaries of death are\nvague\u2014would partially merge this approach with the previous one,\nwhich construed death as a process. We have noted that one response to\nthe claim of vague boundaries (the response favored in the previous\napproach) is to embrace several lines, each for a different purpose,\nin determining death. Another possibility is to understand the vague\nboundaries as inviting discretion in the matter of producing a single\nstandard of death. So long as a particular standard does not have\nclear and highly implausible implications, it is admissible for\nconsideration on this view. Society may then select, among admissible\nstandards, whichever is most attractive for practical purposes. It has\nbeen argued, along these lines, that the higher-brain standard is\ninadmissible for implying that those in PVS are dead while the\ntraditional cardiopulmonary standard is inadmissible for implying (in\nprinciple) that a still-conscious individual might be dead, clearing\nthe ground for the whole-brain standard, which has no fatal\nimplications and is attractive from a practical standpoint (Chiong\n2005).\n\nHaving already explored difficulties (and strengths) of each standard,\nhow might we evaluate the more general thesis that death is not\namenable to classical definition? One strategy open to critics of this\nreasoning, of course, is to argue that some definition is adequate.\nAnother is to defend the disaggregation of death, as previously\ndiscussed. A third strategy would be to argue that our failure thus\nfar to produce an adequate definition does not mean that none is\npossible. Some concepts can be adequately captured by classical\ndefinitions even if it is difficult to produce them. It would appear\npremature, therefore, to render a judgment on the success of the\npresent approach to understanding human death.\n4.3 Death as Separable from Moral Concerns\n\nA final assumption underlying the mainstream discussion of the\ndefinition of death is that human death is a morally crucial marker.\nWere it not, then accuracy in the definition of death would be of\npurely ontological, conceptual, or scientific interest. This attitude,\nof course, is not the prevailing one. Not only do we tend to regard\nmany behaviors as appropriate only if an individual has died; the\ncriminal law treats as momentous the question of whether one person\nhas killed\u2014that is, caused the death of\u2014another person,\neven if such considerations as motive, deliberation, and special\ncircumstances are also important.\n\nIt is not difficult to see, though, how one might challenge this\npresumption of death's moral salience. After all, we have already\nbegun to remove certain behaviors from the class of death behaviors.\nFor example, in many circumstances termination of life supports need\nnot await a patient's death. And, as we have noted, there are calls to\nabandon the dead-donor rule in the context of organ transplantation.\nWe might go further in separating death from the cluster of moral\nconcerns traditionally associated with it. For example, without\nembracing the higher-brain approach to death, we could hold that\nirreversible loss of the capacity of consciousness entails a loss of\nmoral status, at which point traditional death behaviors are\nappropriate (Persson 2002). We might even overhaul the criminal law\nwith respect to killing:\n\nIt is then the irrevocable loss of the capacity for consciousness that\nis the great loss; so it is for the causing of it that criminal law\nshould mete out the severest punishment. Killing, or the causing of\n(biological) death, should be punished to this degree only if, as is\nnormally the case, it brings along the irrevocable loss of the\ncapacity for consciousness (ibid, 32).\n\n\nOne implication of this proposal is that harvesting organs from PVS\npatients, thereby killing them, would not be punishable insofar as\nthese patients, having irrevocably lost the capacity for\nconsciousness, have already suffered \u201cthe great loss\u201d and\nno longer possess moral status. Some attracted to this approach will\nwant to argue further that the crime of murder is really that of\ncausing the irrevocable loss of the capacity for consciousness\nwithout first obtaining voluntary, informed consent from the\nperson to be killed. The\nitalicized qualification would create conceptual space for a\njustification of active euthanasia (see the entry on\n voluntary euthanasia).\n\nThe present proposal to separate the issue of death from what is\nmorally important is somewhat radical. Yet its chief ground for doing\nso, the claim that the capacity for consciousness is what underlies\nmoral status, cannot be dismissed. On the other hand, this claim\napparently relies on the thesis (which we considered in connection\nwith the higher-brain approach) that only what affects one's\nexperience can affect one's interests. As we saw, this thesis is far\nfrom self-evident. For those who disagree with it, the time of\ndeath\u2014the time at which one no longer exists (at least in this\nworld)\u2014is likely to retain some of the moral importance\ntraditionally accorded to it. Moreover, even if the philosophical case\nfor demoting the moral importance of death were airtight, we cannot\nresponsibly dismiss widely held sensibilities, including those at odds\nwith the present approach, in constructing public policies concerning\ndeath. Certainly it is contestable to what extent the public could\nembrace further demotion of the moral importance of death, and to what\nextent its limited ability to do so matters for public policy.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"RefCit\">References Cited</a>", "<a name=\"OthImpWor\">Other Important Works</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"RefCit\">References Cited</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Ad Hoc Committee of the Harvard Medical School, 1968, \u201cA\nDefinition of Irreversible Coma\u2014Report of the Ad Hoc Committee\nof the Harvard Medical School to Examine the Definition of Brain\nDeath,\u201d <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em> 205\n(6): 337\u201340.", "Baker, L.
