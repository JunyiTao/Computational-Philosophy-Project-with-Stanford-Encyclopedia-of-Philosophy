    "main_text": "Ontic Structural Realism (OSR)\n4. Ontic Structural Realism (OSR)\n\nWorrall\u2019s statement of structural realism in his 1989 paper is\nnot explicitly epistemic, and some of his remarks prompt a different\ninterpretation:\n\n\nOn the structural realist view what Newton really discovered are the\nrelationships between phenomena expressed in the mathematical\nequations of his theory. (1989: 122)\n\n\nSome philosophers of physics had already more explicitly signalled a\nsignificant departure from traditional realist metaphysics. For\nexample, Howard Stein says:\n\n\n[O]ur science comes closest to comprehending \u201cthe real\u201d,\nnot in its account of \u201csubstances\u201d and their kinds, but in\nits account of the \u201cForms\u201d which phenomena\n\u201cimitate\u201d (for \u201cForms\u201d read \u201ctheoretical\nstructures\u201d, for \u201cimitate\u201d, \u201care represented\nby\u201d). (1989: 57)\n\n\nMichael Redhead (1999: 34) says: \u201cthe best candidate for what is\n\u2018true\u2019 about a physical theory is the abstract structural\naspect\u201d. Accordingly, Ladyman (1998) argues that structural\nrealism ought to be developed as a metaphysical position according to\nwhich, since the continuity in scientific change is of \u201cform or\nstructure\u201d, the success of science should be accounted for in\nterms of the representation of modal relations among phenomena, not in\nterms of continuity of reference to objects and properties. Giere\n(1985) first suggested that a form of structural realism results from\nconjoining modal realism with constructive empiricism to form a modal\nempiricism. The idea of modal structure is central to OSR in the work\nof French, Ladyman, Ross and others, and is an abstraction of causal\nstructure and nomological structure, that is intended to also include\nsymmetry principles and perhaps more (the structure of dispositions\ndescribed by Mumford (2004) and Psillos\u2019s (2002) idea of\nnomological structure are more restrictive ideas of modal structure).\nThe reason why it is claimed that some modal structure is retained on\ntheory change, as well as the approximate truth of empirical\nregularities, is that counterfactuals, explanations and predictions\nare retained in a limited domain or regime when an old theory is\nsuperseded. For example, the reason the same side of the Moon always\nfaces the Earth was explained by Newton in the third book of the\nPrincipia in terms of a gravitational tidal lock, and this explanation\nand related counterfactuals and predictions are retained in current\nphysics even though Newtonian gravitation has been superseded by\nGeneral Relativity. Nora Berenstain and Ladyman (2012) argue that a\ncommitment to natural necessity is implicit in arguments for\nscientific realism, and that all scientific realists should be\nrealists about modal structure as a form of natural necessity, and so\nshould reject Humean supervenience. However, Esfeld (2009) develops a\nHumean take on structural realism, as does Lyre (2010). Ruyant (2019)\nconsiders how to understand continuity of modal structure in the\nhistory of science in terms of a modalised Ramsey sentence which he\nargues supports modal empiricism as distinct from structural\nrealism.\n\nOSR has attracted most sympathy among some philosophers of physics and\nphysicists. This is natural since, while Worrall\u2019s motivation\nfor introducing structural realism was solely the need for a realist\nresponse to the pessimistic meta-induction, the proposal of OSR in\nLadyman (1998) and its development in French and Ladyman (2003a,b) and\ntheir subsequent work was also motivated by two other problems:\n\nidentity and individuality of quantum particles and\nspacetime points, and entanglement;\nscientific representation, in particular the role of\nmodels and idealisations in physics.\n\n\nTheir concern with\n (a)\n followed that of many of the pioneers of structuralism in\ntwentieth-century philosophy of science including Cassirer, Eddington\nand Weyl. (Russell\u2019s and Carnap\u2019s versions of\nstructuralism were more directly motivated by epistemological and\nsemantic problems than by ontological issues arising from physics.)\nFrench did seminal work on the identity and individuality of quantum\nparticles with Michael Redhead (French & Redhead 1988). In\nrelation to\n (b),\n Redhead also wrote a classic paper on theories and models (1980), and\nFrench and Ladyman (1999) defended and developed the model-theoretic\napproach to scientific theories; Ladyman and Ross (2007), Gordon\nMcCabe (2007), French (2014) and Wallace (2022) all defend OSR\nas a view that takes account of the ineliminability of mathematics in\nhow physics represents.\n\nOSR may be advocated as a response to current physics as a whole (for\nexample, see Tegmark 2008), or in part (see below). Karim\nTh\u00e9bault (2016) considers quantisation in order to formulate\nOSR. Dorato and Morganti (2022) consider structural realism as an\nontology for Rovelli\u2019s Relational Quantum Mechanics. Saunders\nand David Wallace have deployed structuralism to solve the problem of\nhow macroscopic objects with more or less determinate properties can\nbe recovered from the Everett interpretation of quantum states (the\nso-called preferred basis problem) (Saunders 1993b, 1995, and Wallace\n2003). Saeed Masoumi (2021b) defends OSR by considering how to break\nthe underdetermination of different forms of Newtonian physics.\n(Different versions of OSR are also elaborated and defended against\nvarious criticisms in Ladyman and Ross (2007), French and Ladyman\n(2011), Ladyman (2011), French (2014) and further sources cited\nbelow.)\n\nOntic structural realists argue that current physics teaches us that\nthe nature of space, time and matter are not compatible with standard\nmetaphysical views about the ontological relationship between\nindividuals, intrinsic properties and relations. On the broadest\nconstrual OSR is any form of structural realism incorporating an\nontological or metaphysical thesis that inflates the ontological\npriority of structure and relations. The attempt to make this precise\nsplinters OSR into different forms (three of these are discussed in\nAinsworth (2010) and he argues against two of them), and all of the\nfollowing claims have been advocated by some defenders of OSR at some\ntime (and some of them overlap, or differ largely or solely only in\nemphasis).\n\n(1)\nEliminativism: there are no individuals (but there is relational\nstructure).\n\n\nA crude statement of ESR is the claim that all we know is the\nstructure of the relations between things and not the things\nthemselves, and a corresponding crude statement of OSR is the claim\nthat there are no \u201cthings\u201d and that structure is all there\nis, and in particular there are no individual things. This is called\nand \u201celiminative structural realism\u201d by Psillos (2001) who\nobjects to the elimination of objects from ontology, and\n\u201cradical structuralism\u201d by van Fraassen (2006), who argues\nit collapses the distinction between abstract and concrete structure\nand between pure mathematics and physics. For a recent defence of an\nexplicitly eliminativist version of OSR see French (2010, 2016,\n2019a). For a form of eliminativism about individuals in metaphysics\ndeveloped without reference to structural realism see Dasgupta\n(2009).\n\nEliminativism is criticised on the grounds that there cannot be\nrelations without relata. This objection has been made by various\nphilosophers including Cao (2003b), Dorato (2000), Psillos (2001,\n2006a), Busch (2003), Morganti (2004) and Chakravartty (1998, 2003)\nwho says:\n\n\none cannot intelligibly subscribe to the reality of relations unless\none is also committed to the fact that some things are related. (1998:\n399)\n\n\nThe idea is that structure requires individuals, since structure is\nrelations, and relations require relata which are individuals. Even\nmany of those sympathetic to OSR object that it amounts to crediting\nrelations without relata (Esfeld & Lam 2008; Lyre 2004; Stachel\n2006; and Yaghmaie 2021).\n\nHowever, there are at least two ways to make sense of the idea of\nrelations without relata:\n\n\n\nThe idea of a universal. For example, when we refer to the relation\nreferred to by \u201clarger than\u201d, it is because we have an\ninterest in its formal properties that are independent of the\ncontingencies of its instantiation. To say that all that there is are\nrelations and no relata, is perhaps to follow Plato and say that the\nworld of appearances is not properly thought of as part of the content\nof knowledge. (See Esfeld & Lam 2008: 5, and the opening epigram\nin Psillos 2006a) This Platonic version of OSR is perhaps what Howard\nStein has in mind:\n\n\n\u2026 if one examines carefully how phenomena are\n\u201crepresented\u201d by the quantum theory\u2026 then\u2026\ninterpretation in terms of \u201centities\u201d and\n\u201cattributes\u201d can be seen to be highly dubious\u2026 I\nthink the live problems concern the relation of the Forms \u2026 to\nphenomena, rather than the relation of (putative) attributes to\n(putative) entities \u2026. (Stein 1989: 59)\n \n\n\nThe relata of a given relation always turn out to be relational\nstructures themselves on further analysis. As Stachel puts it,\n\u201cit\u2019s relations all the way down\u201d (although he\ndenies the claim, 2006). See Saunders (2003d: 129) and Ladyman and\nRoss (2007) for the idea that there may be no fundamental relata, and\nhence that it is relational structure all the way down. The idea that\nthere may be no fundamental level to reality is discussed in Schaffer\n(2003). Much discussion of OSR in ever form relates to issues of\nfundamentality and the relative ontological priority of objects,\nproperties and relations. Horgan and Potrc (2000) take the fundamental\nlevel to be the whole universe so that there are not really any\nrelations because there is only one thing. Schaffer 2010 argues that\nthere are no external relations, in the sense that all relations are\ninternal to the one thing that is everything. Other metaphysicians who\ndoubt, deny or downgrade relations include John Heil, E.J.Lowe and\nPeter Simons (see Marmodoro & Yates 2016). \n\n\nAnother response to the relations without relata objection is to argue\nthat OSR does not require that there be no relata, just that the\nrelata not be individuals. However, there is no unanimity about the\ndifference between individuals, objects, and entities among\nphilosophers. One way of putting the issue is to ask whether all\nobjects are individuals, or whether individuals are objects satisfying\nsome additional criteria (for example, having identity over time or\ntransworld identity, see Ladyman 2016). Clearly, debates about OSR are\nnot productive unless the terminology is univocal, and the\nphilosophical logic of individuals, objects and relations is explicit,\nand, given the extent of disagreement among philosophers about these\nmatters, the sources cited here and in general should be read with the\npossible differences in terminology in mind.\n\n(2)\nThere are relations (or relational facts) that do not supervene on\nthe intrinsic and spatio-temporal properties of their relata.\n\n\nThe interpretation of entangled states in quantum mechanics in terms\nof strongly non-supervenient relations is due to Carol Cleland (1984).\nHowever, the idea that there could be relations which do not supervene\non the non-relational properties of their relata runs counter to a\ndeeply entrenched way of thinking among some philosophers, whose\nconception of structure is usually based on predicate logic and set\ntheory. Hence, it is often assumed that a structure is fundamentally\ncomposed of individuals and their intrinsic properties, on which all\nrelational structure supervenes. The view that this conceptual\nstructure reflects the structure of the world is called\n\u201cparticularism\u201d by Paul Teller (1989) and \u201cexclusive\nmonadism\u201d by Dipert (1997). It has been endorsed by many\nphilosophers, including Aristotle and Leibniz.\n\nSpatio-temporal relations might be exempted from this prescription\nsince the idea that the position of an object is intrinsic to it is\nassociated with a very strong form of substantivalism. Hence, a\nstandard view is that the relations between individuals other than\ntheir spatio-temporal relations supervene on the intrinsic properties\nof the relata and their spatio-temporal relations. This is David\nLewis\u2019s Humean supervenience:\n\n\n[A]ll there is to the world is a vast mosaic of local matters of\nparticular fact, just one little thing and then another \u2026 We\nhave geometry: a system of external relations of spatio temporal\ndistance between points (of spacetime, point matter, aether or fields\nor both). And at these points we have local qualities: perfectly\nnatural intrinsic properties which need nothing bigger than a point at\nwhich to be instantiated \u2026 All else supervenes on that. (1986:\nx)\n\n\nTim Maudlin argues against this on the basis of quantum entanglement\nand argues that this means the end of ontological reductionism, and\nabandoning the combinatorial conception of reality that comes from\nthinking of the world as made of building blocks, each of which exists\nindependently of the others (1998: 59) and: \u201cThe world is not\njust a set of separately existing localized objects, externally\nrelated only by space and time\u201d (1998: 60). Similarly, advocates\nof OSR such as French and Ladyman emphasise that the non-supervenient\nrelations implied by quantum entanglement undermine the ontological\npriority conferred on individuals in most traditional metaphysics.\nSome relations are at least ontologically on a par with individuals,\nso either relations are ontologically primary, or neither is\nontologically primary or secondary. (Oliver Pooley 2006 and Esfeld\n& Lam 2008 hold the latter view, but Esfeld 2003, 2004 goes\nfurther and claims that if there are intrinsic properties they are\nontologically secondary and derivative of relational properties [see\nbelow].) Primitive nonsupervenient relations of entanglement are a\nform of primitive modal structure. As discussed above and below, many\nadvocates of OSR take the objective modal structure of the world to be\nontologically fundamental, in the sense of not supervening on the\nintrinsic and spatio-temporal properties of their relata. The\noperational theory research programme in physics considers quantum\nmechanics in a more general space of theories that is analogous to the\nspace of possible worlds of modal logic. Emily Adlam (2022) interprets\nthe different constraints placed on correlations in different\noperational theories as different specifications of modal structure.\nSee also Constructor Theory (Deutsch 2013), which is a formalism for\nphysical theories based on possible and impossible transformations of\nstates.\n\n(3)\nIndividual objects have no intrinsic natures.\n\n\nOn this view, individual objects of a particular kind are\nqualitatively identical. They are not individuated by an haecceity or\nprimitive thisness. Classical particles can be and often are so\nregarded, because if a principle of impenetrability is adhered to, no\ntwo such particles ever have all the same spatio-temporal properties.\nIf there are spatio-temporal properties that distinguish each thing\nfrom every other thing, the identity and individuality of physical\nobjects can be reduced to other facts about them. The bundle theory of\nindividuation was developed by empiricists to account for the\nindividuation of physical objects in terms of properties that are\nwithin the reach of natural science (such properties are called\n\u201cqualitative\u201d by Saunders).\n\nThis is a standard metaphysical position that implies nothing so\nradical as any version of OSR. It is relevant because it is often\ntaken to require the Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles\n(PII), which states in contrapositive form that there are no distinct\nobjects having all the same properties (the discernibility of the\ndistinct). PII is trivially true if its scope is taken to include\nproperties that involve particular objects such as haecceities since\nclearly no two objects have the same haecceity, so it must be\nrestricted so that such properties are not in its scope. The problem\nwith PII is that prima facie in Quantum Mechanics entangled quantum\nstates of many particles attribute exactly the same intrinsic and\nrelational properties to each of them. For example, the famous singlet\nstate of two fermions, such as electrons, attributes to the pair the\nrelation that their spins in any given direction are opposite to each\nother, but does not attribute a definite spin in any direction to\neither particle alone. Given that they may also be attributed exactly\nthe same spatial wavefunction, as when they are both in the first\norbit of an atom, for example, then such particles would seem to\nviolate PII. This leads to a dilemma that was articulated by Steven\nFrench and Michael Redhead (1988); either quantum particles are not\nindividuals, or they are individuals but the principle of\nindividuation that applies to them must make reference to some kind of\nempirically transcendent haecceity, bare particularity or the\nlike.\n\nFrench and Krause (2006) argue that quantum particles and spacetime\npoints are not individuals, but that they are objects in a minimal\nsense, and they develop a non-classical logic according to which such\nnon-individual objects can be the values of first-order variables, but\nones for which the law of identity, \u201cfor all x,\nx is identical to x\u201d, does not hold (but\nneither does \u201cx is not identical to x\u201d).\nKatherine Brading and Alexander Skiles (2012) consider the\nplausibility of arguing for structural realism on the basis of this\nunderdetermination. The relationship between OSR and PII is assessed\nin Ainsworth (2011). The appeal to this problem of metaphysical\nunderdetermination is criticised by Chakravartty (2003), who argues\nthat it cannot be significant since it also obtains in the case of\neveryday objects. Morganti (2004) argues in favour of transcendental\nindividuation, and also points out that if quantum mechanics is not\ncomplete and there are hidden variables as in Bohm theory, the quantum\nparticles may be individuated by their intrinsic and spatio-temporal\nproperties after all. Saunders argues that there is no\nunderdetermination for reasons explained in\n (5)\n below.\n\n(4)\nThere are individual objects or things, but they do not have any\nirreducibly intrinsic properties.\n\n\nMichael Esfeld (2004) rejects\n (1)\n and argues that:\n\n\n(a) relations require relata\n\n\nbut denies that:\n\n\n(b) these relata must have intrinsic properties over and above the\nrelations in which they stand.\n\n\nAs mentioned above Esfeld holds that there are things and relations\nbut neither is ontologically primary or secondary. On this view, all\nthe properties of individual objects are relations to other objects.\nThis view is called \u201cmoderate structural realism\u201d by\nEsfeld (and Esfeld & Lam 2008, 2011 and see also Lam & Esfeld\n2012). It avoids the problems with\n (1)\n above, and is compatible with\n (2)\n and\n (3).\n Any version of\n (4)\n that is combined with (3) arguably makes individuals ontologically\ndependent on relational structure (see\n (6)\n below).\n\nBenacerraf (1965) argues that there cannot be objects possessing only\nstructural properties. The idea of such objects is denounced as\n\u201cmysticism\u201d by Dummett (1991), and criticised in the\ncontext of structural realism by Busch (2003). These objections go\nback to Russell:\n\n\n\u2026it is impossible that the ordinals should be, as Dedekind\nsuggests, nothing but the terms of such relations as constitute a\nprogression. If they are to be anything at all, they must be\nintrinsically something; they must differ from other entities as\npoints from instants, or colours from sounds. What Dedekind intended\nto indicate was probably a definition by means of the principle of\nabstraction\u2026But a definition so made always indicates some\nclass of entities having\u2026 a genuine nature of their own (1903:\n249 [ch. XXX, \u00a7 242]).\n\n\nOn the other hand, D.W. Mertz (1996) defends \u201cnetwork instance\nrealism\u201d and rejects the \u201ctyranny of the monadic\u201d\narguing that individuated relation instances are ontologically\nfundamental. McKenzie (2016) argues on the basis of considering\nfundamentality in particle physics that particles are not defined by\nintrinsic properties.\n\n(5)\nFacts about the identity and diversity of objects are\nontologically dependent on the relational structures of which they are\npart.\n\n\nSaunders (2003a, 2003b and 2006) argues that there is a notion of\ndiscernibility (discussed by Quine 1976) that is satisfied even by\nelectrons in the singlet state described above. Two objects are\n\u201cweakly discernible\u201d iff they satisfy some relation that\nis irreflexive in the pair of them. By the uncontentious converse of\nPII, sometimes known as \u201cLeibniz\u2019 law\u201d, namely the\nPrinciple of the Indiscernibility of Identicals (or contrapositively\nput, the Distinctness of the Discernible), if the relation\n\\(a\\mathbin{R}b\\) holds but the relation \\(b\\mathbin{R}a\\) does not,\nthen there must be distinct relata \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Electrons in the\nsinglet state stand in the relation of having opposite spin, and, an\nelectron cannot have an opposite spin to itself, so, argues Saunders,\nthey are weakly discernible. In this way the facts about the identity\nand diversity of objects are ontologically dependent on the\nqualitative relations they bear to each other.\n\nThis runs counter to the usual way of thinking according to which\nthere are individuals in spacetime whose existence is independent of\neach other, and facts about the identity and diversity of these\nindividuals are determined independently of their relations to each\nother (Stachel 2006 calls this \u201cintrinsic individuality\u201d).\nIt is widely held that relations between individuals cannot\nindividuate (account for the identity and diversity) of those same\nindividuals or, as it is often put, \u201crelations presuppose\nnumerical diversity and so cannot account for it\u201d. The argument\nis that without distinct individuals that are metaphysically prior to\na relation, there is nothing to stand in the relation irreflexively\nthat is supposed to confer individuality on the relata. The issue was\nfamously discussed by Russell (1911), and see also MacBride (2006).\nLadyman and Ross (2007), Saunders (2006) and Stachel (2006) argue that\nfacts about the identity and diversity of fermions are not intrinsic,\nand obtain only in virtue of the relations into which they enter. On\nthis view the individuality of quantum particles is ontologically on a\npar with, or secondary to the relational structure of which they are\nparts. Stachel (2006) calls this \u201ccontextual\nindividuality\u201d and he extends this to spacetime points (see\n \u00a74.3\n below).\n\nHannes Leitgeb and Ladyman (2007) note that in the case of\nmathematical structures there is nothing to rule out the possibility\nthat the identity and diversity of objects in a structure is a\nprimitive feature of the structure as a whole that is not accounted\nfor by any other facts about it (Ladyman (2007) also discusses such\nprimitive contextual individuality). One important question so far not\nmuch discussed is whether on the contextualist view the identity and\ndiversity of the objects depends on the whole structure or just part\nof it. Another important issue is which if either of identity and\ndiversity is primitive. Ladyman, Linnebo, and Pettigrew (2012) present\nsome results about the relative strengths of different forms of\ndiscernibility in languages with and without names and identity (see\nalso Ladyman 2015, 2016). In particular it turns out that weak\ndiscernibility in a language without names is equivalent to absolute\ndiscernibility in a language with names. In the light of this it is\nperhaps not surprising that in the recent literature the position that\nquantum particles can be absolutely discerned after all is defended in\ndifferent ways by various authors (see Bigaj 2022 for a recent and\ncomprehensive discussion of questions about the identity and\nindividuality of quantum particles). Bigaj (2014) interprets the\nontological dependence of objects on relational structures in terms of\ncounterfactual identification, not identity and diversity, to propose\nan essentialist version of non-eliminativist OSR. For criticism of\nnon-eliminative OSR in particular see Chakravartty (2012).\n\n(6)\nThere are no self-subsistent objects, and relational structure is\nontologically subsistent.\n\n\nThis claim is associated with quantum holism and holism more generally\n(see Horgan & Potrc 2000 and 2002). As mentioned above this is\narguably implied by the conjunction of\n (3)\n and\n (4),\n and also by\n (5).\n The basic idea of ontological self-subsistence is that of being able\nto exist without anything else existing. The notions of ontological\ndependence and ontological subsistence are often employed in\ndiscussions of structuralism, but are in need of clarification (see\nLinnebo 2007). Kerry McKenzie (2014) uses Fine\u2019s recent analyses\nof ontological dependence to argue against eliminativist OSR and in\nfavour of moderate structural realism based on a case study from\nparticle physics, and McKenzie (2020) formulates OSR in terms of\ndetermination. Vassallo, Naranjo, and Koslowski (2022) defend a\nmetaphysics of self-subsisting structures for classical mechanics.\n\n(7)\nIndividual objects are constructs\n\n\nFrench (1999) and French and Ladyman (2003a) maintain that individuals\nhave only a heuristic role. Poincar\u00e9 similarly argued that\n\u201cthe gross matter which is furnished us by our sensations was\nbut a crutch for our infirmity\u201d (1898: 41). Ladyman and Ross\n(2007) argue that objects are pragmatic devices used by agents to\norient themselves in regions of spacetime, and to construct\napproximate representations of the world. Anyone who defends\neliminativism as in\n (1)\n above must similarly offer a non-ad hoc account of the point\nand value of reference to and generalization over objects in science.\nFor example, cognitive science may show that we are not able to think\nabout certain domains without hypostatising individuals as the bearers\nof structure. This is a subject for further study.\n\nThe articles in Landry and Rickles (2012) explore some of the above\nissues. See McKenzie\u2019s (2013) review of the collection. See also\nthe collection Bokulich and Bokulich (2011). Jo Wolff (2012) considers\nthe relationship between objects and structures, arguing that the\nformer are not reducible to the latter, and suggesting that a form of\nontic structural realism may be defended in terms of the claim that\nobjects are ontologically dependent on structures.\n",
