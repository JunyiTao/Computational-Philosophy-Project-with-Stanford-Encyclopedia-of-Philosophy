    "main_text": "History of Fallacy Theory || Mill\n2.8 Mill\n\nJohn Stuart Mill\u2019s contribution to the study of fallacies is\nfound in Book V of his comprehensive A System of Logic,\nRatiocinative and Inductive, first published in 1843. It stands\nout most strikingly for placing the study of fallacies within his\nframework of inductive reasoning, a direct rejection of\nWhately\u2019s deductivist approach to reasoning and fallacies. Mill\nheld that only inductive reasoning counts as inferring and accordingly\nhe introduces new categories as well as a new classification scheme\nfor fallacies.\n\nMill drew a division between the moral and the intellectual causes of\nfallacies. The former are aspects of human nature such as biases and\nindifference to truth which incline us to make intellectual mistakes.\nThese dispositions are not themselves fallacies. It is the\nintellectual errors, the actual taking of insufficient evidence as\nsufficient, that are fallacious. The various ways in which this can\nhappen are what Mill took as the basis for classifying fallacies.\n\u201cA catalogue of the varieties of evidence which are not real\nevidence,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis an enumeration of\nfallacies\u201d (1891, Bk.V iii \u00a71).\n\nMill divided the broad category of argument fallacies into two groups:\nthose in which the evidence is distinctly conceived and those in which\nit is indistinctly conceived. Fallacies falling under evidence\nindistinctly conceived (Bk. V, vii) were further described as\nfallacies of confusion. These result from an indistinct conception of\nthe evidence leading to a mistaking of its significance and thereby to\nan unsupported conclusion. Some of the traditional Aristotelian\nfallacies such as ambiguity, composition and division, petitio\nprincipii, and ignoratio elenchi, are placed in this\ncategory. Although Mill followed Whately closely in his exposition of\nthe fallacies of confusion, he does not mention any\nad-arguments in connection with ignoratio\nelenchi.\n\nAs for the category of fallacies of evidence distinctly conceived, it\ntoo is divided. The two sub-classes are fallacies of ratiocination\n(deduction) and fallacies of induction. The deductive fallacies (Bk.V,\nvi) are those that explicitly break a rule of the syllogism, such as\nthe three-term rule. But also included are the conversion of universal\naffirmatives and particular negatives (\u201cAll PS\u201d does not\nfollow from \u201cAll SP,\u201d and \u201cSome P not S\u201d does\nnot follow from \u201cSome S not P\u201d). Also included in this\ncategory is the secundum quid fallacy.\n\nThe other sub-class of fallacies distinctly conceived bring out what\nis distinctive about Mill\u2019s work on the fallacies: that it is\nthe first extensive attempt to deal with fallacies of induction. He\ndivided inductive fallacies into two further groups: fallacies of\nobservation (V, iv) and fallacies of generalization (Bk. V, v).\nFallacies of observation can occur either negatively or positively.\nTheir negative occurrence consists in non-observation in which one has\noverlooked negatively relevant evidence. This is similar to what the\nPort-Royal Logic considered a faulty enumeration, and one of\nMill\u2019s examples is the continued faith that farmers put in the\nweather forecasts found in almanacs despite their long history of\nfalse predictions. Observation fallacies occur positively when the\nmistake is based on something that is seen wrongly, i.e., taken to be\nsomething that it is not. Such mal-observations occur when we mistake\nour inferences for facts, as in our inference that the sun rises and\nsets (Bk. V, iv, 5).\n\nFallacies of generalization, the other branch of inductive fallacies,\nresult from mistakes in the inductive process which can happen in\nseveral ways. As one example, Mill pointed to making generalizations\nabout what lies beyond our experience: we cannot infer that the laws\nthat operate in remote parts of the universe are the same as those in\nour solar system (Bk. V, v, 2). Another example is mistaking empirical\nlaws stating regularities for causal laws\u2014his example was\nbecause women as a class have not hitherto equalled men as a class,\nthey will never be able to do so (Bk. V, v, 4). Also placed in the\ncategory of fallacies of generalization is post hoc ergo propter\nhoc, which tends to single out a single cause when there are in\nreality many contributing causes (Bk. V, v, 5). Analogical arguments\nare identified as a false basis for generalizations; they are\n\u201cat best only admissible as an inconclusive presumption, where\nreal proof is unattainable\u201d (Bk. V, v, 6).\n\nMill also included what he calls fallacies of inspection, or a\npriori fallacies (Bk. V, iii) in his survey of fallacies. These\nconsist of non-inferentially held beliefs, so they fit the belief\nconception of fallacies rather than the argument conception. Among\nMill\u2019s examples of a priori fallacies are metaphysical\nassumptions such as that distinctions of language correspond to\ndistinctions in nature, and that objects cannot affect each other at a\ndistance. Even the belief in souls or ghosts is considered an a\npriori fallacy. Such beliefs will not withstand scrutiny, thought\nMill, by the inductive method strictly applied.\n\nA System of Logic is the most extensive work on fallacies\nsince Aristotle\u2019s Sophistical Refutations. Mill\u2019s\nexamples are taken from a wide range of examples in science, politics,\neconomics, religion and philosophy. His classificatory scheme is\noriginal and comprehensive. Frederick Rosen (2006) argues that\nMill\u2019s pre-occupation with the detection and prevention of\nfallacies is part of what motivates the celebrated second chapter of\nOn Liberty. Despite these considerations, the Logic\nis not much referenced by fallacy theorists.\n",
