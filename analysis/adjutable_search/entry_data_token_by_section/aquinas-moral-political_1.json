To this\nstandard interpretation other interpreters, such as Grisez, Finnis,\nand Rhonheimer, object on grounds such as these:\n\n(i) Aquinas\u2019 austerely self-disciplined purposes as an\nAristotelian commentator make quite insecure any assumption that he\ntreats as fundamental to his own thinking any and every proposition\nwhich is treated by Aristotle as fundamental and expounded in\nAquinas\u2019 relevant commentary without adverse comment.\n\n(ii) The \u201cdistinctive function\u201d argument is not\nprominent or adduced as fundamental (or at all) in Aquinas\u2019 more\nfree-standing treatments of morality.\n\n(iii) The argument is treated by Aquinas\u2019 commentary as yielding\nthe conclusion that felicitas (human happiness or\nflourishing) consists in a complete life lived in accordance with\nreason and hence, by entailment, with virtue. But in the Summa\nTheologiae this is argued to be only an imperfect and incomplete\nfelicitas, and the problematic character of such a concept is\napparent from the Summa\u2019s definition of\nfelicitas (and synonymously beatitudo) as perfect\ngood and complete satisfaction of all desires.\n\n(iv) The \u201cdistinctive function\u201d argument is inherently\nunsatisfying in ways that could hardly have failed to be apparent to\nso able a philosopher as Aquinas. (a) In Aquinas\u2019 rendering, it\ndepends on the postulate that \u201cnature does nothing in\nvain\u201d, which in turn depends, according to Aquinas, on the\npremise that nature is the product of divine creative rationality, a\npremise which Aquinas himself argues is, though provable, by no means\nself-evident. (b) It seems arbitrary to assume that, if there is an\nappropriate function or operatio of human beings, it must be\npeculiar to them. For peculiarity or distinctiveness has no inherent\nrelationship to practical fittingness, and in fact Aquinas elsewhere\ndenies that rationality is peculiar to human beings since he holds\nthat there are other intelligent creatures (the angels, understood to\nbe created minds unmixed with matter, occupying what would otherwise\nbe a surprising gap in the hierarchy of beings which ascends from the\nmost material and inactive kinds through the vegetative kinds, the\nanimal kinds, and the rational animal humankind, to the one utterly\nactive and intelligent, non-dependent and uncreated divine being).\n\n(v) The root of the weakness of the \u201cpeculiar/distinctive\nfunction\u201d argument is that it is looking in the wrong direction,\ntowards a metaphysical proposition concerning the nature of things,\ninstead of towards what is intelligibly good as an opportunity,\nperhaps even the supreme opportunity, for me and anyone like me (any\nhuman being). And it is a truly fundamental methodological axiom of\nAquinas\u2019s philosophy, from beginning to end of his works, that\nin coming to understand the nature of a dynamic reality such as human\nbeing, one must first understand its capacities, to understand which\none must first understand its act(ivities), to understand which one\nmust first come to understand those activities\u2019 objects. But the\nobjects of human activities are intelligible opportunities such as\ncoming to know, being alive and healthy, being in friendship with\nothers, and so forth \u2013 objects whose attractiveness,\nfittingness, opportuneness, or appropriateness is in no way dependent\nupon, or even much enhanced by, the thought that they are\ndistinctively characteristic of human beings as opposed to other\nanimals.\n\n(vi) The fact that an operatio is distinctive of human beings\ndoes not entail that that operatio is truly valuable, still\nless that it is obligatory, or that it is more valuable than\nalternative and incompatible ways or objectives of acting. For a\npremise containing no evaluative or normative term cannot entail a\nconclusion including such a term. If, on the other hand, the postulate\nthat a certain operatio is the proper (or even a proper)\nfunction of human beings is asserted to be itself evaluative and/or\nnormative rather than, or as well as, factual/descriptive, then some\naccount is needed of the postulate\u2019s source or justification (or\nself-evidence?). Aquinas has a fairly careful account of the\nself-evidence of a number of foundational evaluative and normative\nprinciples, but only one or two of them are said by him to point to\nkinds of operatio distinctive of human beings; two of the\nfoundational principles are explicitly said by him to direct to goods\nthat are not peculiar to human beings.\n\n(vii) The analogy comparing one\u2019s life as a whole to arts and\ncrafts, each with its own distinctive function, operatio,\nseems weak, questionable and indeed question-begging. For life as a\nwhole is open-ended both in having no knowable duration (see 2.2.\nbelow) and in requiring judgment about the choice-worthiness of ends\nas well as means and techniques (see 4.4.1. below). Moreover, Aquinas\nlike Aristotle regularly insists on the irreducibility of the\ndistinction or distinctions between, on the one hand, ars or\nfactio (arts, crafts, techniques) and actio (the\nprecise subject-matter of morality and morally significant\nchoices).\n",
