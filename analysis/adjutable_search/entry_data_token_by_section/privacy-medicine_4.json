    "main_text": "Informational Privacy || Anonymity\n1.4 Anonymity\n\nAnonymity has value in a variety of public health and medical research\ncontexts. Research publications commonly shield the identities of\nbiomedical research subjects or clinical patients. Special attention\nis paid to genetic information. Although a number of prominent\nscientists and lay people have made their genomes public, genetics\nresearch and scholarly publication standards call for protection of\nthe identities of research subjects and their families. Bioethicists\ndistinguish between identifiable, de-identified and anonymized whole\ngenome sequencing data. (Presidential Commission, 2012) In the US,\nde-identified data is not protected under the laws protecting human\nsubjects known as the Common Rule. Concerns can arise about whether\nparticular methods of de-identification and anonymization adequately\nshield individuals from invasion of privacy and breaches of\nconfidentiality (Yoo et al. 2018). \u201cDifferential privacy\u201d\nis an anonymization approach to personal data sharing favored by some\ncomputer scientists that has potential value to health care data\n(Dwork 2006).\n\nThe use of the anonymously deployed personal diary for learning about\nand assessing health-related behavior is commonplace (Minichiello et\nal. 2000). Research subjects are asked to record contraception use,\ncondom use and other sexual practices in diaries which become research\ntools. Researchers must take care to warn research subjects about the\ndangers of disclosing information which could expose them to social or\nlegal sanctions. \n\nIn the context of COVID-19, North American policy makers were\npresented with members of the public who concealed their infected\nstatus and chose to travel on airplanes, congregate and not wear\nmasks. In the heyday of the HIV/AIDS crisis in North America,\npolicymakers similarly struggled to find ethically sound approaches to\ninfectious disease control in the face of imperfect compliance with\nrecommended best practices. Controversy arose in the 1990s over\nanonymous testing. Anonymous HIV/AIDS testing is now routinely\nperformed but was once controversial among ethicists. Anonymity was\ndefended on the ground that it encouraged testing by individuals\nwishing to control when, whether and to whom to disclose their\nHIV/AIDS status (Fairchild et al. 2007a). On the other hand, it was\nrecognized that behavioral surveillance is a potentially useful\ncomponent of aggressively protecting public health (Fairchild et al.\n2007b; Gallagher et al. 2007; Burr 1999); in some situations,\nanonymous testing could make tracking patterns of infection more\ndifficult. It was suggested that anonymous testing allowed infected\npersons to engage in dangerous, morally irresponsible sexual behavior\nwithout accountability. Proponents of anonymous testing replied that\npolicy-makers and ethicists should not assume that men and women who\nlearn they are HIV positive on the basis of anonymous tests would\negoistically conceal their status from sexual partners. A few\nindividuals will knowingly impose serious risks on others, but newly\ninformed positive test-takers may responsibly notify past and future\npartners, refrain from risky behaviors, and seek medical care. The\nethical issues surrounding HIV/AIDS have changed now that the\ncondition is less stigmatizing and, in developed countries, is a\ntreatable chronic condition rather than a death sentence. \n",
