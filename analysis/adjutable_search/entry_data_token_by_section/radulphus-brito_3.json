    "main_text": "Grammar || The Modi significandi or the Principles of Grammatical Speech\n3.2 The Modi significandi or the Principles of Grammatical Speech\n\nThe principles of the grammatical expression\u2014what makes an\nexpression grammatical\u2014are the modes of signifying (modi\nsignificandi) of its constituent parts (Rosier-Catach 1995),\nwhich are the parts of speech (partes orationis), i.e., noun,\nverb, participle, pronoun, preposition, adverb, conjunction, and\ninterjection. The modes of signifying are, in turn, the formal\nconstituent features of these parts (QPm; QPm-1980:\n138\u2013139).\n\nA part of speech is the result of a series of hylomorphic compositions\nstarting with articulated sound (vox). First, the word\n(dictio) is the result of the hylomorphic composition of an\narticulate sound (vox) and the relation of signification\n(ratio\n significationis).[4]\n This relation links the articulate sound to the thing signified\n(res significata, for res significata, see\nRosier-Catach 1995), regardless of the thing\u2019s different modes\nof being (modi essendi; for modi essendi, see Donati\n2013). In fact, things and their modes of being are not identical. For\ninstance, a horse may happen to be a particular horse, a universal\nhorse, my horse, etc., but being particular, being universal, being\nmine, etc. are all different from being a horse.\n\nA part of speech (pars orationis) is the result of the\nhylomorphic composition of a word and a mode of signifying. The mode\nof signifying, in turn, is derived from some of the modes of being a\nthing may have (QPm; QPm-1980: 164). For instance, a\n\u2018walk\u2019 has the mode of signifying of a qualified\nsubstance, because it indicates the action of walking as a qualified\nsubstance (QPm; QPm-1980: 192\u2013193). This mode\nof signifying directly results from a particular mode of understanding\n(modus intelligendi) the action of walking, namely from\nunderstanding it as a qualified substance. Generally speaking, then,\nthe modes of signifying are taken from their corresponding modes of\nunderstanding; and the modes of understanding, in turn, are taken from\nthe modes of being of things. This is, in fact, the fundamental tenet\nof the modistic grammar to which Brito adheres: the modes of\nsignifying follow from the modes of understanding things, which in\nturn follow from the modes of being of things. Note, however, that a\nwalk is in itself an action and not a substance. But this is not a\nproblem for grammar\u2019s scientific status because a grammatical\nitem takes its mode of signifying from the possible modes of being of\nthings and not necessarily from the actual modes of being of a\nword\u2019s significate (QPm; QPm-1980: 164).\nConsequently, every mode of signifying is ultimately grounded in a\nreal mode of being, making the science of grammar grounded in\nsomething real. \n\nHaving established that every mode of signifying corresponds, through\na mode of understanding, to a thing\u2019s mode of being, Brito goes\non to introduce a distinction between active and passive modes of\nsignifying, as well as between active and passive modes of\n understanding.[5]\n The passive mode of understanding and the passive mode of signifying\nare the mode of being as understood and the mode of being as indicated\nby the part of speech, respectively. Therefore, although the passive\nmode of signifying, the passive mode of understanding, and the mode of\nbeing are features of the same thing, they are notionally\ndifferent.\n\nThe active mode of understanding and the active mode of signifying are\nthe intellectual apprehension of the mode of being and the\ncorresponding relation of consignification whereby the part of speech\nindicates that mode of being (QPm; QPm-1980: 153).\nHence, the active mode of understanding and the active mode of\nsignifying are both notionally different and features of different\nthings. Nevertheless, they are linked by a causal relation, because\nthe mode of understanding immediately causes the mode of signifying.\nThus, the active modes of signifying and understanding are similar\n(QPm; QPm-1980: 158).\n\nFinally, the active and passive modes of signifying are notionally\nidentical, but they are features of different things. This is because\none and the same relation of consignification is considered on the one\nhand as a feature of a grammatical item and, on the other, as a\nfeature of a thing. The same goes for the active and passive modes of\nunderstanding (QPm; QPm-1980: 170).\n\nSince grammar is mainly concerned with the principles of grammatical\nspeech, one could expect these principles to be the active modes of\nsignifying\u2014the formal features of the words that constitute a\ngrammatical phrase. However, since the active modes are notionally\nidentical to the passive ones, Brito claims that, from a formal\nperspective, both the active and the passive modes of signifying are\nthe principles of grammatical constructions. The modes of being, on\nthe contrary, are the principles of grammatical constructions only\ninsofar as they are consignified by the parts of speech (QPm;\nQPm-1980: 173).\n\nA grammatical phrase is formed when the modes of signifying of its\nconstituent parts are compatible with each other (QPm;\nQPm-1980: 132). Hence, \u2018a man runs\u2019 is a\ngrammatical construction, because the mode of signifying of \u2018a\nman\u2019 (i.e., the mode of the qualified substance) and that of\n\u2018runs\u2019 (i.e., the mode of being performed) are compatible\nwith each other. These modes of signifying are in turn compatible with\neach other because the modes of being that \u2018a man\u2019 and\n\u2018runs\u2019 consignify are compatible with each other.\n",
