    "main_text": "Philosophical Foundations || Human Nature\n2.2 Human Nature\n\nThe second pillar of the fa political philosophy is the view of human\nnature (or, as Harris [forthcoming] prefers to call it, human\nmotivations). The fa texts eschew the discussion of whether\nor not human badness or goodness are inborn, or whether or not all\nhumans possess fundamentally similar qualities. What matters is,\nfirst, that the overwhelming majority of humans are selfish and\ncovetous; second, that this situation cannot be changed through\neducation or self-cultivation; and, third, that this selfishness can\nbecome an asset to the ruler rather than a threat. That \u201cthe\npeople follow after benefit as water flows downward\u201d (Book\nof Lord Shang 23.3, \u201cRulers and ministers\u201d) is a\ngiven: the task is to let the people satisfy their desire for glory\nand riches only in the ways that accord with the state\u2019s needs.\nThe Book of Lord Shang explains:\n\n\nWherever the name (repute) and benefit meet, the people will go in\nthis direction.\u2026 Farming is what the people consider bitter;\nwar is what the people consider dangerous. Yet they brave what they\nconsider bitter and perform what they consider dangerous because of\nthe calculation [of a name and benefit]. \u2026 When benefits come\nfrom land, the people exhaust their strength; when the name comes from\nwar, the people are ready to die. (Book of Lord Shang\n6.4\u20136.5, \u201cCalculating the land\u201d)\n\n\nThat people covet wealth was a commonplace in the texts of competing\nthinkers; but the Book of Lord Shang adds a second universal\nmotivating force\u2014the quest for \u201ca name\u201d\n(ming \u540d), a term that refers both to fame and\nreputation and to enhanced social status (Pines 2020b; cf. Lewis\n2021). This quest should be properly understood and manipulated so as\nto direct the people to the pursuits deemed necessarily by the state,\nviz. agriculture and warfare (see section 3 below).\n\nThe fa thinkers\u2019 view of the people as covetous and\nselfish was not exceptional to this intellectual current: it was\nshared, among others, by the major Confucian thinker,\n Xunzi\n \u8340\u5b50 (d. after 238 BCE). Yet unlike Xunzi and other\nConfucian thinkers, the fa texts dismiss the possibility that\nelite members\u2014the cultivated \u201cnoble men\u201d\n(junzi \u541b\u5b50)\u2014would be able to overcome\ntheir selfishness. Hence, the fa thinkers dismiss the common\nrecommendation to staff the government with morally upright\n\u201cnoble men\u201d as na\u00efve if not outright manipulative.\nShen Dao explains:\n\n\nAmong the people, everybody acts for himself. If you [try to] alter\nthem and cause them to act for you, then there will be none whom you\ncan attain and employ. \u2026 In circumstances where people are not\nable to act in their own interests, those above will not employ them.\nEmploy the people for their own [interests], do not employ them for\nyour sake: then there will be none whom you cannot make use of.\n(Harris 2016: 112)\n\n\nShen Dao dismisses the possibility that officials will be driven by\nmoral commitment; actually, such exceptional selfless individuals\nshould not be employed at all. This sentiment recurs in Han\nFeizi, a text that expresses with utmost clarity its belief that\nevery member of the elite\u2014like any member of\nsociety\u2014pursues his own interests (Goldin 2020: 201\u201328).\nLike Shen Dao, Han Fei acknowledges the existence of selfless\nindividuals, such as lofty recluses who despise glory and riches, but\ndismisses them as politically useless. As for morally upright\nofficials, these are too rare individuals to be relied upon.\n\u201cToday, there are no more than ten honest and trustworthy men of\nservice (shi \u58eb), but there are hundreds of offices\nwithin the boundaries. If you insist on exclusively appointing honest\nand trustworthy men of service, then there will be not enough people\nfor the official positions\u201d (Han Feizi 49.11,\n\u201cFive vermin\u201d).\n\nHaving dismissed the common expectation that top echelons of political\nsystem would be filled in with morally cultivated persons, the\nfa thinkers propose an alternative. A proper system should be\nbased on impersonal standards and norms, which would function well\nunder any type of political leaders.\n",
