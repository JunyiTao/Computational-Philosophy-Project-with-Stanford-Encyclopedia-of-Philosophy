    "main_text": "\n\nThe study of gender in Confucian philosophy is a complicated task,\nsince there is no conceptual equivalent of \u201cgender\u201d in the\nChinese linguistic construct. Instead of deriving from a set of\nnatural dispositions or bodily functions, man and woman in the\nConfucian textual tradition are kinship- and ritual-dependent. The\nprocess of genderization where a person becomes a socially\nrecognizable \u201cman\u201d (nan \u7537) or\n\u201cwoman\u201d (n\u00fc \u5973) is concomitant with\nthe process of ritualization where gender differentiation is embedded\nin various familial/social roles marked along the lines of\n\u201cinside\u201d (nei \u5167) and \u201coutside\u201d\n(wai \u5916). The sphere of nei, when it is\ncoupled with woman, denotes a restrictive ritual and physical boundary\nthat is mainly concerned with household management and familial roles\nof wife and mother. Women of talents and virtues who are able to\ntransgress the restrictive ritual boundary of nei into the\nexpansive realm of wai are few and far between.\n\nBeyond examining the \u201cstandard\u201d canonical Confucian texts,\nthe incorporation of historical records of women\u2019s biographies\nsuch as the biographies of \u201cexemplary women\u201d\n(lien\u00fc \u5217\u5973) and the didactic texts for\nwomen such as the Four Books for Women (N\u00fcsishu\n\u5973\u56db\u66f8) in the discussion of gender is necessary,\nsince Confucianism\u2014the inexact translation of its Chinese\ncounterpart, Ru \u5112\u2014is not a study of a singular\nthinker; rather it is a family of thoughts with an extensive and\ndiverse textual tradition. This uniquely women-centric literary genre\nnot only provides us with a wealth of women\u2019s biographical\nrecords and perspectives but also offers a rare window into the\nemergence of gender-based consciousness legitimizing both female\nreadership and female authorship, despite the fact that advanced\nliteracy is ritually reserved for men only. This is one of the\nparadoxical fallouts from these conservative didactic texts that aim\nat fostering female dependency and compliance to patrilineage.\n\nThe prioritization of patrilineage underpins the Chinese family system\nand is codified in various ritual practices. The marriage rite, for\ninstance, has two different meanings for men and women. For women,\nmarriage is an occasion of exodus from her natal family and hence her\npersonhood/womanhood hinges on her ability to fully integrate into her\nhusband\u2019s patrilineage. For men, marriage serves two ritual\nfunctions: ensuring the continuity of sacrificial services in his\nancestral hall, and posterity. And since only patrilineage counts,\nhaving a male heir is of utmost importance not just for men, but also\nfor new brides and mothers-in-law alike who oftentimes participate in\ngender oppressive practices in order to amass sufficient resources, to\nproduce or acquire the coming of a male heir. Footbinding, although\nunconnected to Confucian philosophy textually, nonetheless is a\npopular entrance into the study of gender oppression in pre-modern\nChina. The familiar exoticization of footbinding is a clear case of\n\u201corientalism\u201d seeing non-western cultures as barbaric and\noppressive to the so-called \u201cthird-world\u201d women.\n\nDismissing the ethical valence of non-western traditions as devoid of\nfeminist potential, if not outright anti-feminist, is a common\nsentiment in feminist discourse inter-culturally. This is true in the\ncontemporary feminist engagement with Confucian philosophy as well.\nPushbacks against this feminist caricature of Confucianism from the\nChinese-comparative communities began to surface around the mid-1990s,\nfirst focusing on the positive comparison between care ethics and\nConfucian ren \u4ec1, and then expanding into possible\nConfucian applications to various contemporary issues such as\nabortion, same-sex marriage, elder care, etc. Building on this\npositive feminist engagement with Confucian philosophy, here proposed\nis a hybrid feminist theory\u2014Confucian feminism\u2014using\nConfucian terms, methods, and concerns as a theoretical basis to\naddress women\u2019s issues, experiences, and concerns in the\ncontemporary world. This hybrid feminist theory is a forward-looking\nproject intended to spur further positive feminist engagement with\nConfucian philosophy in order to formulate diverse and viable\nconceptual tools for women to envision their own liberatory future\nbeyond the confine of the western philosophical canon.\n",
