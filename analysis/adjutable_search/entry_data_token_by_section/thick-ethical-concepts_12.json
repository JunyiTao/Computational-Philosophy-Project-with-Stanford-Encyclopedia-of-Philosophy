    "main_text": "The Delineation Question: How Do Thick and Thin Concepts Differ? || Thick and Thin Differ in Kind\n5.1 Thick and Thin Differ in Kind\n\nOne way for thick and thin to differ in kind would be for thin terms\nexpress purely evaluative concepts and for thick terms to express\nconcepts that aren\u2019t purely evaluative but encode also\nnon-evaluative information. An early version of this proposal is due\nto Bernard Williams: thin terms are wholly action-guiding whereas\nthick terms are both action-guiding and world-guided (Williams 1985:\n152). His particular version is problematic: the notion of\naction-guidingness isn\u2019t as clear as one would like and many\nphilosophers take also thin terms to be world-guided in the sense that\ntheir application depends on how the world is. (For a more recent\nversion, see Dancy 2013: 47\u201351.) In its general form, this\nproposal presupposes the Semantic View but is available to both\nSeparabilists and Inseparabilists. Similarly, although Williams denies\nThin Centralism concerning the relations of conceptual and explanatory\npriority between thick and thin concepts, the general proposal could\nbe combined with Thin Centralism or the No Priority view. A potential\nproblem for it is that it isn\u2019t clear whether all paradigmatic\nthin concepts are wholly evaluative, given the intuitive idea that\nthick terms are those that somehow involve both evaluation and\nnon-evaluative description. If ought implies can as\na conceptual or analytic matter, then its application will be\nrestricted by the non-evaluative condition that the agent is able to\nperform the action (V\u00e4yrynen 2013: 7). In that case\nought wouldn\u2019t look descriptively much thinner than\nsome terms that are often classified as thick. The application of\nadmirable, for instance, is non-evaluatively constrained only\nby the non-evaluative features of admiration. As noted in\n section 3.2,\n not all entailments of an expression are encoded in its meaning and\nit isn\u2019t straightforward to determine which are. But competence\nwith at least certain concepts ought can be used to express\nmay well require that if we think you ought to do something, we would\naccept that you can do it if the question came up.\n\nAnother way to think that thick and thin differ in kind is generated\nby Pragmatic Views. These views entail that thick terms aren\u2019t\nevaluative as a matter of truth-conditions, but are only used\nevaluatively. Insofar as thin terms are evaluative as a matter of\ntruth-conditions, they will clearly differ in kind from the thick.\nHere the difference in kind would be such as to support\nNon-Centralism. However, as noted above, some arguments for Pragmatic\nViews might imply that thin terms are equally not evaluative as a\nmatter of truth-conditions but only used evaluatively. There would\nthen be no difference in kind (in this respect, anyway) between thick\nand thin. It would remain a separate question whether there are any\ninteresting relations of conceptual or explanatory priority between\nthick and thin concepts.\n",
