    "main_text": "Extensions || Other Philosophies\n3.3 Other Philosophies\n\nAlthough references to philosophers in the pragmatist tradition, such\nas John Dewey and George Herbert Mead are scattered through\nSchutz\u2019s writings, it was to William James that he devoted his\nfirst full-length essay after arriving in the United States. Briefly\nalluding to the methodological differences between Husserl and James,\nhe emphasized two points where the \u201cgreat masters\u201d\nconverged: the stream of thought and the theory of fringes. Both\nthinkers stressed that personal consciousness involves no multiplicity\nof elements needing to be reunited, but rather a unity from which one\nseparates out components, and they each examined the modifications\nthat reflection introduces into the lived stream, converting an\n\u201cI\u201d into a \u201cMe\u201d or uncovering the workings of\nintentionality. Further, Husserl\u2019s idea that the kernel of\nmeaning distinguishing an object stood out against the unthematized\nnetwork of relationships that makes up its horizon paralleled\nJames\u2019s belief that topics have their \u201cfringes.\u201d\nSuch fringes connect a topic with other experiences, such that, for\ninstance, one does not hear merely \u201cthunder,\u201d but\n\u201cthunder-breaking-in-upon-silence-and-contrasting-with-it.\u201d\nSimilarly, the Jamesian idea about grasping as a unity what must be\nlearned through a many-stepped processes, such as the Pythagorean\ntheorem, could be translated into the Husserlian terminology regarding\nthe monothetical grasping of polythetic processes. Likewise,\nJames\u2019s discussion of focusing on an object within a broader\ntopic resembled Husserl\u2019s view that one could discern a noema,\nthat is, a perspectival aspect through which a thing constituted of\nmany such aspects presented itself.\n\nAnother American philosopher to whom Schutz dedicated an entire essay\nwas George Santayana, whose Dominations and Powers he\nreviewed. While most of the essay was expository, Schutz praised\nSantayana\u2019s effort to base politics on a philosophical\nanthropology and his insights into the enslaving potential of\ntechnology. However, Schutz, no doubt convinced by Mises\u2019s\npositive assessment of economic activity, resisted Santayana\u2019s\nreduction of it to domination. Likewise, as a phenomenologist opposed\nto a Santayana\u2019s naturalistic founding of spirit on the physical\norder of nature, Schutz dissented from a conviction derived from this\nnaturalism, namely, that democracy could solve it problems only by\nreturning to the \u201cgenerative order\u201d of agriculture.\n\nBesides these interchanges with American philosophers, Schutz (later\nin his career) interpreted the work of Max Scheler and (earlier)\nengaged thoroughly his treatment of intersubjectivity, a topic that\nSchutz insisted was to be treated within the natural attitude, in\nwhich one never doubted the existence of others. Schutz agreed with\nScheler\u2019s belief that the \u201cWe\u201d is given prior to the\n\u201cI\u201d\u2014a position that the latter defended on the basis\nof the psychology of children and cultures less accustomed to\nself-reflection. Schutz supported this priority, however he did so on\nthe grounds that while living in one\u2019s acts in the natural\nattitude and living also in the other\u2019s present experience as it\nunfolds, one at first does not clearly distinguish one\u2019s own\nthoughts from others\u2019. Nevertheless, as soon as one reflects on\nhis own stream of consciousness\u2014and children and cultures may\ndevelop this capacity for self-reflection later\u2014he becomes aware\nthat his experiences are his own. Schutz found plausible\nScheler\u2019s belief in the inner (indubitable) perception of the\nother, if \u201cinner perception\u201d refers to anything connected\nwith mental life or if one locates the experience of living in the\nvivid simultaneity of the \u201cWe\u201d within his own conscious\nstream, as Schutz believed possible. However much in that vivid\nsimultaneity one might be unable to doubt the other\u2019s existence,\none could still be mistaken about specific thoughts of the others,\nsince by belonging to the other\u2019s stream of\nconsciousness these thoughts share the dubitability characterizing\nouter perceptions, likewise transcendent to one\u2019s stream of\nexperience.\n\nAnother figure, more or less within the phenomenological tradition,\nwhose views on intersubjectivity Schutz examined and criticized, was\nJean-Paul Sartre, particularly the Sartre of Being and\nNothingness. In \u201cSartre\u2019s Theory of the Alter\nEgo,\u201d Schutz elucidated Sartre\u2019s attempt to develop an\nextra-empirical, real communication with the other that avoids the\nextremes of an empiricist intersubjectivity beginning with the\nother\u2019s body and an idealist reduction of the other to a series\nof presentations. After explaining Sartre\u2019s differences\nregarding intersubjectivity with Husserl, Hegel, and Heidegger, Schutz\nlaid out Sartre\u2019s existential account of how the other is given\nas a subject through the Look and how one can in turn objectify the\nother by returning the gaze. Although Sartre had intended to describe\nhow one\u2019s body is given to the other, he instead portrayed how\nthe other\u2019s body is given to oneself, assuming that such\ndescriptions were reversible. Schutz, who did not believe that the\nproblem of intersubjectivity could be addressed adequately within the\ntranscendental sphere, applauded Sartre\u2019s rejection of\nHusserl\u2019s transcendental approach to intersubjectivity; however,\nSartre\u2019s emphasis on the other as a center of activity reflected\na continuing Husserlian influence. The main problem, though, with\nSartre\u2019s doctrine was that its starting point in a mutual\nlooking, by which each subject reduces the other to an object,\nprecluded any possibility of a relationship between the I-subject and\nother-subject. Further, Schutz wondered how Sartre would know that the\nother\u2019s body was given to him in the same way that his body was\nto the other if the other\u2019s subjectivity escaped his\n\u201cI.\u201d Moreover, Schutz acknowledged that the other\u2019s\ninterests might not coincide with his own, but he failed to see how\nthis fact entailed that either the other or he reduce each other to a\nutensil. Instead, he pointed to the \u201cmutual tuning-in\u201d to\nbe found in making music together and in language as proof that\nsubjects interact as \u201cco-performing subjectivities\u201d and\nthat mutual interaction in freedom better describes intersubjectivity\nthan Sartre\u2019s practical solipsism.\n",
