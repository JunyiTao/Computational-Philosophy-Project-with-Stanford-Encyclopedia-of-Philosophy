    "main_text": "Legitimate Authority, de facto Authority and Political Power\n1. Legitimate Authority, de facto Authority and Political Power\n\n\nLet us start with the distinctions between political authority as a\nnormative notion (or morally legitimate authority) and political\nauthority as a non-normative notion (or de facto authority)\nand between political authority in either of these senses and political\npower. To say that a state has authority in the normative sense is to\nsay something normative about the relationship between the state and\nits subjects. This is the relationship that we will concentrate on in\nwhat follows.\n\n\nFor most contemporary theorists to say that the state has authority in\nthe descriptive sense is to say that the state maintains public order\nand that it issues commands and makes rules that are generally obeyed\nby subjects because many of them (or some important subset of them\nsuch as the officials of the state) think of it as having authority in\nthe normative sense (Hart 1961) (Some thinkers have understood the\nidea of legitimate authority in this descriptive sense as well (Weber\n1970); in what follows, we will use the term \u201clegitimate\nauthority\u201d in a normative sense only.) We should note here that\nthe attitudinal component of de facto authority is not\naccepted by everyone. For both Thomas Hobbes and John Austin,\npolitical authority in the de facto sense simply amounts to\nthe capacity of a person or group of persons to maintain public order\nand secure the obedience of most people by issuing commands backed by\nsanctions.  Subjects need not think of the authority as a legitimate\nauthority, on this account.\n\n\nAlso, the distinction between de facto and morally\nlegitimate authority is not universally accepted or at least it is not\naccepted that the distinction makes a difference. Hobbes insists that\nany entity capable of performing the function of de facto\nauthority is necessarily justified and deserves the obedience of the\nde facto subjects (Hobbes 1668). But most have argued that\nthere is an important distinction between de facto authority\nand legitimate authority. We will explore in what follows the\nconceptions political and legal philosophers have had of legitimate\npolitical authority.\n\nDe facto authority, on anyone's account, is distinct from\npolitical power. The latter is concerned with the state's or any\nagent's ability to get others to act in ways that they desire even when\nthe subject does not want to do what the agent wants him to do.\nPolitical power does not require any kind of pro attitude toward the\nagent on the part of the subject, nor does it require that the state is\nactually successful at securing public order. It operates completely in\nthe realm of threats and offers. No doubt for the state to have de\nfacto authority or legitimate authority requires that the state\nhave the power to compel those subjects who do not wish to go along.\nThis is necessary for the state's ability to maintain public order and\nto assure those who do see it as an authority that it will be able to\ndo what it is supposed to do.\n",
