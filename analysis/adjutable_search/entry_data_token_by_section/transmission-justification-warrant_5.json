    "main_text": "Applications\n4. Applications\n\nThe notions of transmissive and non-transmissive argument, above and\nbeyond being investigated for their own sake, have been put to work in\nrelation to specific philosophical problems and issues. An important\nproblem is whether Moore\u2019s infamous proof of an external world\nis successful, and whether so are structurally similar Moorean\narguments directed against the perceptual skeptic and\u2014more\nrecently\u2014the non-believer. Another issue pertains to the\nsolution of McKinsey paradox. A third issue concerns\nBoghossian\u2019s (2001, 2003) explanation of our logical knowledge\nvia implicit definitions, criticized as resting on a non-transmissive\nargument schema (see for instance Ebert 2005 and Jenkins 2008). As the\ndebate focusing on the last topic is only at an early stage of its\ndevelopment, it is preferable to concentrate on the first two, which\nwill be reviewed in respectively\n Sect. 4.1\n and\n Sect. 4.2\n below.\n",
