    "main_text": "The History of Theories of Evil || Kant\u2019s Theory of Evil\n2.2 Kant\u2019s Theory of Evil\n\nImmanuel Kant, in his Religion Within the Limits of Reason\nAlone, was the first to offer a purely secular theory of evil,\ni.e., a theory that does not make reference to supernatural or divine\nentities and which is not developed as a response to the problem of\nevil. Kant\u2019s concern is to make sense of three apparently\nconflicting truths about human nature: (1) we are radically free, (2)\nwe are by nature inclined toward goodness, (3) we are by nature\ninclined toward evil.\n\nKant\u2019s thoughts on evil and morality have had an important\ninfluence on subsequent philosophers writing about the nature of evil\nsuch as Hanna Arendt, Claudia Card, and Richard Bernstein. However,\nmost theorists acknowledge that Kant\u2019s theory is disappointing\nas a theory of evil in the narrow sense since it does not pick out\nonly the morally worst sorts of actions and characters. (See, e.g.,\nCard 2010, 37). Instead, Kant equates evil with having a will that is\nnot fully good.\n\nAccording to Kant, we have a morally good will only if we choose to\nperform morally right actions because they are morally right (Kant\n1785, 4: 393\u20134:397; Kant 1793, Bk I). On Kant\u2019s view,\nanyone who does not have a morally good will has an evil will. There\nare three grades of evil which can be seen as increasingly more evil\nstages of corruption in the will. First there is frailty. A person\nwith a frail will attempts to perform morally right actions because\nthese actions are morally right, but she is too weak to follow through\nwith her plans. Instead, she ends up doing wrong due to a weakness of\nwill (Kant 1793, Bk I, 24\u201325).\n\nThe next stage of corruption is impurity. A person with an impure will\ndoes not attempt to perform morally right actions just because these\nactions are morally right. Instead, she performs morally right actions\npartly because these actions are morally right and partly because of\nsome other incentive, e.g., self-interest. Someone with an impure will\nperforms morally right actions, but only partly for the right reason.\nKant believes that this form of defect in the will is worse than\nfrailty even though the frail person does wrong while the impure\nperson does right. Impurity is worse than frailty because an impure\nperson has allowed an incentive other than the moral law to guide her\nactions while the frail person tries, but fails, to do the right thing\nfor the right reason (Kant 1793, Bk I, 25\u201326).\n\nThe final stage of corruption is perversity, or wickedness. Someone\nwith a perverse will inverts the proper order of the incentives.\nInstead of prioritizing the moral law over all other incentives, she\nprioritizes self-love over the moral law. Thus, her actions conform to\nthe moral law only if they are in her self-interest. Someone with a\nperverse will need not do anything wrong because actions which best\npromote her self-interest may conform to the moral law. But since the\nreason she performs morally right actions is self-love and not because\nthese actions are morally right, her actions have no moral worth and,\naccording to Kant, her will manifests the worst form of evil possible\nfor a human being. Kant considers someone with a perverse will an evil\nperson (Kant 1793, Bk I, 25).\n\nMost contemporary theorists reject Kant\u2019s view that the worst\nform of evil involves prioritizing self-interest over the moral law\n(See, e.g., Card 2010, 37 and 2002; Garrard 2002; Kekes 2005).\nWhether, and to what extent, a person, or her will, is evil seems to\ndepend on details about her motives and the harms she brings about and\nnot just on whether she prioritizes self-interest over the moral law.\nFor instance, it seems far worse to torture someone for sadistic\npleasure than to tell the truth to gain a good reputation. In fact, it\nseems reasonable to suppose that the first act (sadistic torture)\nindicates an evil will while the second act (telling the truth for\nself-interest) indicates a will that is merely lacking in moral\ngoodness. But for Kant, both acts indicate wills that are equally evil\n(for attempts to address this criticism see Garcia 2002, Goldberg\n2017, and Timmons 2017).\n\nKant makes several other controversial claims about the nature of evil\nin Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone. One of these\nclaims is that there is a radical evil in human nature. By this he\nmeans that all human beings have a propensity to subordinate the moral\nlaw to self-interest and that this propensity is radical, or rooted,\nin human nature in the sense that it is inextirpable. Kant also\nbelieves that we are imputable for this propensity to evil (Kant 1793,\nBk I). Richard Bernstein argues that Kant cannot coherently hold both\nof these theses since we could not be responsible for a propensity\nthat is in us originally and that we cannot be rid of (Bernstein 2002,\n11\u201335). Notwithstanding this important criticism, several\nphilosophers have argued that Kant\u2019s thoughts on radical evil\noffer important insights into the nature of evil. For example, Paul\nFormosa argues that Kant\u2019s reflections on radical evil draw our\nattention to the fact that even the best of us can revert to evil, and\nthus, that we must be constantly vigilant against the radical evil of\nour natures (Formosa 2007. See also, Bernstein 2002 and Goldberg\n2017).\n\nIn his Confessions, Saint Augustine tells us that one day he\nstole some pears for the sole sake of doing something wrong\n(Augustine, Confessions, II, v-x). Kant rejects the idea that\nhuman beings can be motivated in this way (Kant 1793, Bk I, sect. 2).\nFor Kant, human beings always have either the moral law or self-love\nas their incentive for acting. Only a devil could do what is wrong\njust because it is wrong. (For more about Kant and diabolical evil see\nBernstein 2002, 36\u201342; Card 2010 and 2016, 36\u201361; Allison\n2001, 86\u2013100; and Timmons 2017, 319\u2013327).\n",
