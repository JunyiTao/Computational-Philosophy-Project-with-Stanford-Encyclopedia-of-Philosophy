    "main_text": "The Philosophy of Color || Rival Theories of Color\n1.6 Rival Theories of Color\n\nThere are two issues concerning color realism: (1) what sort of\nproperties are colors? (2) do objects really possess those properties?\nWith respect to the first question, there is deep division between\ndifferent color realists (as well as between them and eliminativists).\nSetting out the views of major realists and eliminativists, we have\nthe following major rival theories:\n\nColors are \u201cprimitive\u201d properties\u2014simple,\nsui generis, qualitative properties that physical bodies\npossess or appear to possess: Primitivism.\nColors are \u201chidden\u201d properties of\nbodies\u2014complex, physical properties that dispose bodies to look\nblue, pink, yellow, etc.: Reductive Physicalism\nColors are perceiver-dependent, dispositional\nproperties\u2014powers to look in distinctive ways to appropriate\nperceivers, in appropriate circumstances: Dispositionalism\nColors are subjective qualities \u201cprojected\u201d onto\nphysical objects and light-sources\u2014qualities which visual\nexperiences represent objects as having: Projectivism.\nColors are subjective qualities\u2014either qualities presented\nin experience or qualities of experiences: Subjectivism.\nColors are \u201chybrid\u201d properties: physical and\nphenomenological.\n\n\nNote: \n\nTheories in category 3 are relational theories of color.\nHistorically, they have been interpreted in terms of normal/standard\nobservers, and standard viewing conditions. Recently there have\ndeveloped versions of the theory which relax these requirements.\nThis taxonomy is a first approximation. Some theorists would hold\nthat there is more than one kind of color: dual referent theorists,\ne.g., Descartes (1644), D.H. Brown (2006).\nSubjectivist theories come in different forms: (a) dualist\nsubjectivism, according to which subjective qualities are irreducible\nto physical properties; (b) subjectivist theories which allow the\npossibility that the subjective qualities are identical to physical\nproperties, e.g., those of the brain.\n\n\nFor further details, see the supplementary document on\n Color Science: Some Complexities.\n",
