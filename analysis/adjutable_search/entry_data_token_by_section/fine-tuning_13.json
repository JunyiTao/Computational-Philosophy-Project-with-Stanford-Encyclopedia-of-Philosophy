It is controversial, however,\nwhether this characterization is adequate. A paradigmatic anthropic\n\u201cexplanation\u201d, characterized as such by Carter in the\nseminal paper (1974) that introduces the anthropic principles, is\nastrophysicist Robert Dicke\u2019s (1961) account of coincidences\nbetween large numbers in cosmology. A prominent example of such a\ncoincidence is that the relative strength of electromagnetism and\ngravity as acting on an electron/proton pair is of roughly the same\norder of magnitude (namely, \\(10^{40}\\)) as the age of the universe,\nmeasured in natural units of atomic physics. Impressed by this and\nother coincidences, Dirac (1938) stipulated that they might hold\nuniversally and as a matter of physical principle. He conjectured that\nthe strength of gravity may decrease as the age of the universe\nincreases, which would indeed make it possible for the coincidence to\nhold across all cosmic times.\n\nDicke (1961), criticizing Dirac, argues that standard cosmology with\ntime-independent gravity suffices to account for the coincidence,\nprovided that we take into account the fact that our existence is tied\nto the presence of mainline stars like then sun and of various\nchemical elements produced in supernovae. As Dicke shows, this\nrequirement dictates that we could only have found ourselves in that\ncosmic period in which the coincidence holds. Accordingly, contrary to\nDirac, there is no reason to assume that gravity varies with time to\nmake the coincidence unsurprising. Carter (1974) and Leslie (1986,\n1989: ch. 6) describe Dicke\u2019s account as an \u201canthropic\nexplanation\u201d of the coincidence that impressed Dirac, and Leslie\ndiscusses it continuously with the argument from fine-tuning for the\nmultiverse. (Earman [1987: 309], however, disputes that Dicke\u2019s\naccount is adequately characterized as an \u201cexplanation\u201d.)\nBut whereas Dicke\u2019s account of the coincidence uses life\u2019s\nexistence as background knowledge to show that standard cosmology\nsuffices to make the coincidence expectable, the standard argument\nfrom fine-tuning for the multiverse, as reviewed in what follows,\ntreats life\u2019s existence as requiring a theoretical response\n(rather than as background knowledge) and advocates the multiverse\nhypothesis as the best such response. Friederich (2019b; 2021: ch. 6)\noutlines how to set up the fine-tuning argument for the multiverse so\nthat it uses anthropic reasoning analogously to the Dicke/Carter\naccounts of large number coincidences.\n",
