    "main_text": "The Primary Concern Regarding the Doctrine of Religious Restraint\n5. The Primary Concern Regarding the Doctrine of Religious Restraint\n\n\nAssume that, in religiously pluralistic conditions, religious citizens\nhave good moral reason\u2014perhaps even a moral obligation\u2014to\npursue secular reasons for their favored coercive laws. Assume as well\nthat secular citizens have good reason to pursue religious reasons for\ntheir favored coercive policies (if only because, with respect to some\ncoercive laws, some of their fellow citizens find only religious\nreasons to support them). What should citizens do, religious or\nsecular, when they cannot identify these reasons?\n\n\n According to advocates of the standard\nview, if a religious citizen fails in his pursuit of secular reasons\nthat support a given coercive law, then he is morally required to\nexercise restraint. After all, if his pursuit of these reasons\nfails, then he does not have any secular reason to offer in favor of\nthat law. Liberal critics of the standard view, by contrast, deny\nthat citizens so circumstanced are morally required to exercise\nrestraint. They claim that from the fact that religious citizens\nare morally required to pursue secular reasons for their\nfavored coercive laws (when that is necessary for persuasion), it does\nnot follow that they should refrain from supporting coercive\nlaws if their pursuit of secular reasons fails. Because our\nhaving an obligation to try to bring about some state of affairs tells\nus nothing about what we ought to do if we cannot bring it about,\nnothing like the DRR follows from the claim that citizens should pursue\nsecular reasons for their favored coercive laws. According to the\nliberal critics, a parallel position applies to non-religious citizens:\nfrom the fact that non-religious citizens are morally required to\npursue religious reasons for their favored laws (when that is necessary\nfor persuasion), it doesn't follow that they should refrain from\nsupporting coercive laws if their pursuit of religious reasons\nfails. For the liberal critics, parity between the religious and\nthe secular obtains both with respect to the obligation to pursue\njustifying reasons and with respect to the permission not to exercise\nrestraint when that pursuit fails.\n\n\nHave we identified a genuine point of disagreement between the liberal\ncritics and advocates of the standard view? It seems so. If the\nliberal critics are correct, all that can be reasonably asked of\nreligious citizens is that, in a pluralistic liberal democracy, they\ncompetently pursue secular reasons for the coercive laws they\nsupport. If the pursuit fails, then they may support these laws for\nexclusively religious reasons. Proponents of the standard view\ndisagree, maintaining that if the pursuit fails, these citizens must\nexercise restraint. This disagreement is rooted in differing\nconvictions about the justificatory role that religious reasons can\nplay. Once again, advocates of the standard view maintain that\nreligious reasons can play only a limited justificatory role: citizens\nmust have and be prepared to offer (at least certain kinds of) secular\nreasons for any coercive law that they support, as religious reasons\nare not enough. The liberal critics deny this, maintaining that no\npersuasive arguments have been offered to believe this. The DRR\nhighlights this disagreement, as it incorporates an assumption that\nreligious and secular reasons play asymmetrical roles in justifying\ncoercive laws.[14]\n\n\n\nAs we have explicated the view of the liberal critics, religious\ncitizens are (in a wide range of cases) morally required to pursue\nsecular reasons for their favored coercive laws, but they needn't\nexercise restraint if they fail in their pursuit. But this position\nraises a question: What's so bad about requiring citizens to exercise\nrestraint? Why should liberal critics object to this?\n\n\n According to the liberal critics, one of\nthe core commitments of a liberal democracy is a commitment to\nreligious freedom and its natural extension, the right to freedom of\nconscience. When citizens use the modicum of political influence\nat their disposal, liberal critics claim that we should want them to do\nso in a way that furthers the cause of justice and the common\ngood. So, for example, when a citizen deliberates about whether\nhe should, say, support the invasion of Afghanistan by the United\nStates and its NATO allies, we want him to determine, as best he can,\nwhether the invasion of Afghanistan is actually morally\nappropriate. In order to determine that, he should be as\nconscientious as he can in his collection and evaluation of the\nrelevant evidence, reach whatever conclusions seem reasonable to him on\nthe available evidence, and act accordingly. If he concludes that\ninvading Afghanistan would be unjust, then he should oppose it.\nThat he does so is not only his right but also morally excellent, as\nacting in accord with responsibly held normative commitments is an\nimportant moral and civic good.\n\n\n This, the liberal critics maintain,\nsuggests a general claim. Whatever the policy and whatever the\nreasons\u2014whether religious or secular\u2014we have powerful\nreason to want citizens to support the coercive policies that they\nbelieve, in good conscience, to be morally appropriate. But that\ngeneral claim has direct application to the issue at hand. It is\npossible, the liberal critics claim, for a morally sensitive and\nepistemically competent citizen to regard only certain religious\nconsiderations as providing decisive support for a given coercive\nlaw. Nicholas Wolterstorff, to return to an earlier example,\nmaintains that only theistic considerations can ground the ascription\nof inherent human rights, some of which are protected by coercive\nlaw. Arguably, were a citizen to find a position such as\nWolterstorff's persuasive, then he should appeal to those\nconsiderations that he actually believes to further the cause of\njustice and the common good. And this should lead us to want him\nto support that law, even though he does so solely on religious\ngrounds, even if he regards that law as having no plausible secular\njustification. Good citizenship in a pluralistic liberal\ndemocracy unavoidably requires citizens to make political commitments\nthat they know their moral and epistemic peers reject but that they\nnevertheless believe, with due humility, to be morally required.\nThis ideal of good citizenship, so the liberal critics claim, applies\nto religious and secular citizens alike.\n",
