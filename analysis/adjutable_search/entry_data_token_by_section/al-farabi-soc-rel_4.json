    "main_text": "The principle of similitude || Knowing: things versus symbolic representations\n3.2 Knowing: things versus symbolic representations\n\nIn order to approach these questions, it is imperative to have a\ncloser look at al-Farabi\u2019s anthropology (\u2018ilm\nal-insan) which represents the backbone of his philosophy of\nsociety and religion. In line with the Greek medical tradition,\nparticularly Galen, al-Farabi is convinced that individual natural\nendowments depend chiefly on two factors, first, the region of the\nworld in which one happens to be born and, second, one\u2019s bodily\nconstitution, i.e., the body\u2019s concrete mixture of elements (cf.\nabove,\n section 2.2).[19]\n For although the human soul as such is immaterial, so long as it is\ncoupled with \u2018its\u2019 body, it depends for its activities\n(including, in a way, thinking) on corporeal organs like the external\nsenses, allowing for sense perception and imagination. Notably,\none\u2019s temperament or natural disposition\u2014determining\nprimarily those processes which can be associated with moods,\nemotions, and, in general, character traits\u2014thus turns out to be\nthe limiting factor defining whether a human being will be\nsharp-witted or rather dull and, hence, able to perfect for herself\nhumanity\u2019s specific ergon, i.e., reasoning.\n\nWhile at first glance this seems to imply natural predestination,\nproviding the happy few, on the one hand, with the means to attain\neudaimonia, but dooming the unfortunate many, on the other,\nto misery, al-Farabi insists that every human being is equipped with\nthe necessary requirements to attain ultimate felicity, even those\nwhose natural disposition does not allow them to become philosophers.\nFor, according to him, people\n\n\n\u2026 whose innate character is sound share in an innate character\nthat disposes them to receive the intelligibles in which they all\nshare and by which they strive toward objects and actions common to\nall of them. Then, afterward, they diverge and differ, thereby coming\nto an innate character that is particular to each one of them and to\neach group. So one among them is disposed to receive certain other\nintelligibles that are not shared, but are particular to him \u2026.\n(Political Regime B, 1, 74: 65)\n\n\nAccordingly, provided one is not born a fool or a madman but a\ncompos\n mentis,[20]\n every human being has the means to \u201cstrive toward objects and\nactions common to all\u201d. These objects and actions common to all,\nmeanwhile, along with \u201cother things which each class knows and\ndoes on its own\u201d (Perfect State V, 16, 2: 261)\nprecisely correspond to the prerequisites for the attainment of\nhappiness discussed above, in\n section 2.2.\n However, as likewise seen above, these prerequisites, and\nparticularly those things which all human beings ought to know, set\nfairly high intellectual standards. Nonetheless, according to\nal-Farabi, the requirement of knowing these common objects does not\nexclude anyone from attaining happiness, because they\n\n\n\u2026 can be known in two ways, either by being impressed on [the\npeople\u2019s] souls as they really are or by being impressed on them\nthrough affinity and symbolic representation. (Perfect State\nV, 17, 2: 279)\n\n\nEvery human being, thus, can attain the individual felicity of the\n hereafter,[21]\n provided, that is, that she learns about the common objects in one of\nthese two ways. It is the duty of society or, more precisely, of the\nruler of the excellent city to ensure that everyone is taught these\nthings according to her capacities. In this connection, now, as will\nbe discussed in\n section 4,\n religion as the \u2018art of persuasion\u2019 has its specific\nplace and significance. Concerning al-Farabi\u2019s notion of\nsociety, however, it is important to note that the chief duty ascribed\nhere to society and the excellent city has notable implications for\nthe nature of its government. Government, as can now be concluded and\nis corroborated by various passages throughout al-Farabi\u2019s\n oeuvre,[22]\n must primarily be described as \u2018offering guidance\u2019,\n\u2018teaching\u2019, or \u2018habituating\u2019.\n\nAt this point, the second aspect mentioned above, i.e., the\n\u201cinnate character that is particular to each [individual] and to\neach group\u201d must be further elucidated (cf. the first quote in\nthis section). Human beings, as noted before, have the same\nrelationship to society as organs to the body. Owing to their\nparticular \u201cinnate character\u201d or specific natural\ndisposition, they hold a particular natural place within the\n\u2018organism society\u2019, with a specific ergon they\nought to perform, so that the entire \u2018body\u2019 can function\nwell. Consequently, human beings not only have a natural duty towards\nthemselves, entailing individual felicity, but also towards society\nand, even beyond, the cosmic order as a whole, contributing both to\nthe proper functioning of their society and to the happiness of the\n\u2018organism cosmos\u2019 and its various\n parts.[23]\n Hence, in correspondence with the particular trades and professions\nimplied by the members\u2019 individual skills, society is structured\nby nature in an at once organic and hierarchical fashion:\n\n\nThe ruling organ in the body is by nature the most perfect and most\ncomplete of the organs in itself and in its specific qualification\n\u2026; beneath it, in turn, are other organs which rule over organs\ninferior to them \u2026; they rule and are ruled. In the same way,\nthe ruler of the city is the most perfect part of the city in his\nspecific qualification and has the best of everything which anybody\nelse shares with him; beneath him are people who are ruled by him and\nrule others. (Perfect State V, 15, 5: 235)\n\n\nThe natural hierarchy underlying a well-ordered society is spelled out\nin terms of al-Farabi\u2019s distinction between ruling and serving\nfunctions. In the excellent city, itself the perfect image of a\nnatural body as well as the cosmos as a whole, the criterion for\nrulership, in the vein of Plato\u2019s Politeia, is\nintelligence and wisdom. This is to say that there is a ruler by\nnature who distinguishes herself by her intimate understanding of the\ncosmic order, its normative implications, human nature, and how to\nrealize the discovered normative implications in view of the diverse\ntalents and limitations determining the citizens\u2019 \u201cinnate\ncharacters\u201d. Ruling the city, as was already stated before,\nconsists in providing precisely this kind of guidance: actualizing the\nvarious potentials in a well-coordinated manner which faithfully\nresembles the functioning of organisms, and thus seeking to facilitate\nevery citizen\u2019s pursuit of\n happiness.[24]\n\nThe excellent ruler, as can now be inferred, is not only the most\naccomplished philosopher possessing a comprehensive theoretical\nknowledge of all there\n is.[25]\n She is also and particularly the one who is able to ensure, first,\nthat every citizen is taught the things they need to do and to know,\nthus inducing individual felicity; and, second, that everyone is\ninstructed in and carries out those \u201cthings which each class\nknows and does on its own\u201d (Perfect State V, 16, 2:\n261; cf. also Political Regime B, 2, 78: 68), in this manner\nsimultaneously bringing about the well-being of the city and\ncontributing to the happiness of the organism cosmos. With this\nbackground, al-Farabi\u2019s account of religion, i.e., the art of\npersuasion or of teaching by virtue of \u201caffinities and symbolic\nrepresentations\u201d can be addressed.\n",
