    "main_text": "Issues || Sharp vs. Fuzzy Boundaries\n1.3 Sharp vs. Fuzzy Boundaries\n\nA third worry relates to vagueness. Aristotle\u2019s definition (as\nwell as standard topology) suggests that there is always a sharp\ndemarcation between the inside (interior) and the outside (exterior)\nof a thing. Yet it may be observed that ordinary objects and events,\nas well as the extensions of many ordinary concepts, may have\nboundaries that are in some sense fuzzy or indeterminate. Clouds,\ndeserts, mountains, let alone the figures of an impressionist\npainting, all seem to elude the idealized notion of a sharply bounded\nentity. Likewise, the temporal boundaries of many events, let alone\ntheir spatial boundaries, seem to be indeterminate. When exactly did\nthe industrial revolution begin? When did it end? Where did it take\nplace? And certainly the concepts corresponding to many ordinary\npredicates, such as \u2018bald\u2019 or \u2018heap\u2019, do not\npossess definite boundaries, either. As again Frege famously put it,\nto such concepts there seems to correspond \u201can area that ha[s]\nnot a sharp boundary-line all around, but in places just vaguely\nfade[s] away into the background\u201d (1903: \u00a756). How is such\nfuzziness to be construed?\n\nOne radical option would be to dismiss the question altogether.\nWittgenstein, for instance, urged that \u201can indefinite boundary\nis not really a boundary at all\u201d (1953: 45e). Or one might as\nwell insist that the issue is purely epistemic: the fuzziness would\nlie exclusively in our ignorance about the exact location of the\nrelevant boundaries, which in themselves would be perfectly sharp\n(Sorensen 1988; Williamson 1994). When taken at face value, however,\nthe question is highly controversial. One may distinguish broadly\nbetween de re accounts and de dicto accounts. On a\nde re account, the fuzziness is truly ontological. Thus,\npace Evans (1978), the boundary of, say, Mount Everest would\nbe fuzzy insofar as there is no objective, determinate fact of the\nmatter about which parcels of land lie on which side (Tye 1990;\nCopeland 1995; Morreau 2002; Hyde 2008). Similarly, a predicate such\nas \u2018bald\u2019 would be vague because it stands for a vague\nset, a set with a truly fuzzy boundary (Zadeh 1965; Goguen 1969). It\nis an open question, then, whether such boundary fuzziness would\nentail a corresponding indeterminacy in the identity conditions of the\nrelevant bounded entities (see e.g. Noonan 2008 vs. Paganini 2017),\njust as it may be an open question whether it would entail an\nobjective indeterminacy in the existence conditions of certain (other)\nentities, say, the mereological difference between Everest and the sum\nof its definite parts (see e.g. Hawley 2002 and Donnelly 2009). By\ncontrast, a de dicto account would correspond to a purely\nlinguistic or conceptual notion of vagueness. There is no fuzzy\nboundary demarcating Mount Everest on this view; rather, there are\nmany distinct parcels of land, each with a precise border and precise\nexistence and identity conditions, but our linguistic practices have\nnot enforced a choice of any one of them as the official referent of\nthe term \u2018Mount Everest\u2019 (Mehlberg 1958; Lewis 1986; McGee\n1997). Similarly, on this view there is no such thing as a vaguely\ndemarcated set of bald people; rather, our linguistic stipulations do\nnot precisely specify which set of people, among the many that exist,\ncorresponds to the extension of \u2018bald\u2019 (Fine 1975; Keefe\n2000).\n\nWhether the fuzziness of a given boundary should be construed de\nre or de dicto may be a case-by-case matter. No one\nthinks that all indeterminacy is a matter of worldly unsettledness,\nand the contrary claim, to the effect that boundary indeterminacy is\nalways the product of semantic or representational imprecision, is\nhighly contentious despite its distinguished pedigree (Russell 1923).\nMoreover, there is room for a middle third-way, according to which\nthere is genuine ontological indeterminacy, but it doesn\u2019t lie\nin the boundaries themselves; it would lie, rather, in the\ndeterminable/determinate structure of boundary properties (Wilson\n20123), or in the fact that it is ontically indeterminate which\nprecise boundaries things have (Akiba 2004; Barnes 2010; Abasnezhad\nand Hosseini 2014). Generally speaking, however, it would seem that\nthe de re/de dicto alternative aligns rather closely with the\nbona fide/fiat opposition. With fuzzy boundaries of the\nfiat sort, a de dicto account suggests itself\nnaturally: insofar as the process leading to the definition of a\nboundary may not be precise, the question of whether something lies\ninside or outside the boundary may be semantically indeterminate. On\nthe other hand, this account does not sit well with boundaries of the\nbona fide sort. If any such boundary were fuzzy, it would be\nso independently of our cognitive or social articulations, hence a\nde re account would seem inevitable; the fuzziness of the\nboundary would lie in the way the world is (or isn\u2019t). Thus, it\nwould appear that a boundary may suffer from de dicto\nfuzziness if and only if it is of the fiat sort, and from\nde re fuzziness if and only if it is of the bona\nfide sort.\n\nEither way, making room for fuzzy boundaries will open the door to the\nmany difficulties that arise whenever vagueness phenomena are taken at\nface value. In particular, both de re and de dicto\naccounts will have to deal with the challenge of providing a way out\nof the sorites paradox: how can we ever cross a fuzzy boundary, if no\nsingle step can make a difference? And both accounts will have to\nprovide a way of accommodating phenomena of higher order vagueness:\nnot only may it be indeterminate whether something lies on one side or\nthe other of a fuzzy boundary; it may also be indeterminate whether it\nis indeterminate whether it lies on one side or the other \u2014 and\nso on. (On these issues, see the entries on the\n Sorites paradox\n and\n vagueness.)\n Some authors think such challenges are insurmountable, and that\nde re and de dicto conceptions are equally\nmisguided. There would be no words or entities with fuzzy boundaries;\nwhenever we think there are, we are, rather, representing the world\nthrough concepts that are strictly speaking \u201cboundaryless\u201d\n(Sainsbury 1990).\n",
