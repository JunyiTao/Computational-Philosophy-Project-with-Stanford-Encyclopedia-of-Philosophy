    "main_text": "The Nature of Delusion || Types of delusion\n2.2 Types of delusion\n2.2.1 Functional versus organic\n\nDelusions used to be divided into functional and\norganic. Now the distinction is regarded by most obsolete, at\nleast in its original characterization. A delusion was called\n\u2018organic\u2019 if it was the result of brain damage (usually\ndue to injuries affecting the right cerebral hemisphere). A delusion\nwas called \u2018functional\u2019 if it had no known organic cause\nand was explained primarily via psychodynamic or motivational factors.\nIt has become more and more obvious with the development of\nneuropsychiatry that the two categories overlap. Today, the received\nview is that there is a biological basis for all types of delusions,\nbut that in some cases it has not been identified with precision yet.\nSome studies have reported very little difference between the\nphenomenology and symptomatology of delusions that were once divided\ninto organic and functional (Johnstone et al. 1988).\n2.2.2 Monothematic versus polythematic\n\nWhen we have persecutory delusions, we believe that we are treated\nwith hostility, and that harm is coming our way. When we have\ndelusions of mirrored-self misidentification, we usually preserve the\ncapacity to recognize images in the mirror as reflections, but do not\nrecognize our own face reflected in the mirror. So, we come to think\nthat there is a person in the mirror, a stranger who looks very much\nlike we do. In either case, the delusion is resistant to\ncounterevidence and can have pervasive effects on our lives. One of\nthe differences is that persecutory delusions are\npolythematic whereas delusions of mirrored-self\nmisidentification are monothematic.\n\nPolythematic delusions extend to more than one theme, where the themes\ncan be interrelated. Delusions of persecution are very common\npolythematic delusions. We may believe to be surrounded by alien\nforces controlling our actions, where the alien forces are slowly\ntaking over people\u2019s bodies including our own. In that case, we\nhave delusions of persecution and delusions of alien control.\nTypically, these delusions are interrelated and are manifest in the\ninterpretation of most events occurring in our lives. Other examples\nof delusions that can be polythematic are the belief that we are\ngeniuses but are misunderstood and underestimated by others\n(grandeur), and the belief that we are secretly loved by a famous or\npowerful person (erotomania).\n\nDelusions of mirrored-self misidentification, instead, are\nmonothematic. Apart from the content of delusion itself, we\nmay report no other unusual belief. Thus, when we systematically fail\nto recognize our image in the mirror and come to think that there is a\nperson identical to us on the other side, and we have no other unusual\nbelief, we have a monothematic delusion. Other examples of delusions\nthat are usually monothematic and are discussed in the philosophical\nliterature are Capgras and Cotard. The Capgras delusion involves the\nbelief that a dear one (a close relative or the spouse) has been\nreplaced by an impostor. The Cotard delusion involves the belief that\nwe are disembodied or dead. \n2.2.3 Circumscribed versus elaborated\n\nMonothematic delusions tend to be circumscribed whereas\npolythematic delusions tend to be elaborated (see Davies and\nColtheart 2000 for a more detailed explanation and some examples). The\ndistinction between circumscribed and elaborated delusions is relevant\nto the level of integration between our delusions and our other\nintentional states and to the extent to which our endorsement of the\ndelusion is manifested in verbal reports and observable behavior.\nDelusions might be more or less circumscribed. A delusion is\ncircumscribed if it does not lead to the formation of other\nintentional states whose content is significantly related to the\ncontent of the delusion, nor does it have pervasive effects on \nbehavior. For instance, a man\nwith Capgras who believes that his wife has been substituted by an\nimpostor but shows no preoccupation for his wife and does not go and\nlook for her, appears to have a circumscribed delusion. A delusion can\nbe elaborated, if we form other beliefs that revolve around\nthe theme of the delusion. For instance, a woman with Capgras can\ndevelop paranoid thoughts related to the content of her delusion,\nalong the lines that the person impersonating her husband has evil intentions and will cause her\nharm when the occasion presents itself.\n2.2.4 Primary versus secondary\n\nDepending on whether the delusion has some understandable origin and\nwe can defend it with arguments, it can be described as\nprimary or secondary. The traditional way of\ndistinguishing primary from secondary delusions relied on the notion\nthat primary delusions \u2018arise out of nowhere\u2019 (Jaspers\n1963). This traditional characterization of the distinction is\nproblematic, because it is difficult to establish whether there are\nantecedents of the delusion, and\nfor other methodological and clinical reasons (e.g., Miller and Karoni\n1996, p. 489). A delusion may arise out of our\nprevious adverse experience that is not known to other, and some studies show\nthat even very unusual beliefs can be made sense of in the context of our lives (Gunn and Larkin 2020). \n\nNew readings of the distinction between primary and secondary have\nbeen provided in the philosophical literature on delusions, where\ndistinctions are made between people who can endorse the content of\ntheir delusions with reasons, and people who cannot (e.g. Bortolotti\nand Broome 2008 talk about authored and un-authored\ndelusions; Aimola Davies and Davies 2009 distinguish between\npathologies of belief and pathological beliefs on\nsimilar lines).\n",
