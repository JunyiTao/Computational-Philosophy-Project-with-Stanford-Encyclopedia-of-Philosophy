Interdisciplinarity is a hallmark of systems and\nsynthetic biology, and both approaches offer rich sources for\nphilosophical analysis of the epistemic features of interdisciplinary\nintegration (O\u2019Malley & Soyer 2012), interdisciplinary\nidentities (Calvert 2012), and of large-scale collaboration across\ndifferent universities (Calvert & Frow 2015; for examples of\nlarge-scale projects see the list of internet resources below).\n\nStudying the prospects and challenges of interdisciplinary integration\nalso offers a window to the cognitive processes involved in\ninterdisciplinary problem-solving, where research cannot rely on a\nsingle theoretical framework (MacLeod & Nersessian 2013a,b).\nThrough this process, different epistemic ideals operating in\ncontemporary science often become apparent. While combining different\nconceptual frameworks can lead to innovation and scientific progress,\nthe existence of different epistemic cultures can also pose challenges\nfor interdisciplinary collaboration (Calvert & Fujimura 2011;\nCarusi 2011; Kastenhofer 2007). Philosophical analysis has been\nproposed to help facilitate collaboration in situations where\nepistemic standards clash. Philosophy of science can help explicate\nthe differences and the backgrounds for these, and uncover\n\u2018blind spots\u2019 considering the aims, values, constraints,\nand challenges of other disciplines (Nersessian 2017).\n\nOne divide that is commonly highlighted is the gap between\nexperimental biologists and modelers with a background in engineering,\nmathematics, or physics. Empirical analyses of collaborations between\nmodelers and experimentalists in systems biology show that these two\ngroups often have different views on what kinds of data and models are\nmost relevant (Joaquium et al. 2019; Nersessian 2017; Rowbottom 2011).\nFor instance, modelers may not be interested in studying biological\nsystems at the same level of detail as experimental biologists, and\nexperimentalists may find highly abstract and idealized models\ninspired by physics or engineering misleading (MacLeod 2018). From the\nperspective of engineers or physicists, the preoccupation with\nmolecular details involves a risk of missing out on dynamic patterns\nthat could be captured with more generic models, while\nexperimentalists may find that such generic models often lack\nspecificity or merely reproduce current biological knowledge. These\ndifferences may in part be grounded in different explanatory standards\nas also discussed in Section 4.2 (Fagan 2016; Green et al. 2015a).\n\nMaking explanatory standards and values more explicit, and clarifying\nthe relative prospects and limitations of different research\nstrategies, are ways in which philosophy of science could contribute\nto science and science education. At the same time, collaborative\npractices in synthetic and systems biology may call for an extension\nof the scope of philosophical analysis. Whereas philosophers\ntraditionally have focused on logical and argumentative relations in\nscientific texts, understanding collaborative practices in systems and\nsynthetic biology may further require the exploration of the\naesthetic, cognitive, and creative dimensions of scientific practice\n(Carusi 2011; Ginsberg et al. 2015). Important questions are which\naspects underlie choices of visualization strategies, and how the\nrepresentation of biological data through diagrams, heat maps, network\nmodels, or state spaces influence biological reasoning and\ncollaboration (Abrahamsen & Bechtel 2015; Carusi 2012; Jones &\nWolkenhauer 2012).\n",
