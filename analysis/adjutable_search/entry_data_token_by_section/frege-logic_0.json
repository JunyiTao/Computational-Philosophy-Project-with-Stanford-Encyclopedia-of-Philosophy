Introduction\n\nThe story regarding Frege\u2019s innovations in logic, and the role\nthat they played in his larger logicist project is usually told along\nsomething like the following lines, which focuses on his three\n\u201cgreat books\u201d. First, Frege invents modern\nquantificational logic in his Begriffsschrift eine der\narithmetischen nachgebildete Formelsprache des reinen Denkens, or\nConcept Script (1879a). Second, Frege criticizes the\nfront-running (at the time) accounts of the foundations of mathematics\nin Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik: eine logisch-mathematische\nUntersuchung \u00fcber den Begriff der Zahl, or The\nFoundation of Mathematics (1884), and he also provides an\ninformal account of his reduction of mathematics to logic. Third,\nFrege carries out the formal reconstruction of arithmetic (and begins\nthe reconstruction of real and complex analysis) in the mammoth\nGrundgesetze der Arithmetik: begriffsschriftlich abgeleitet Band I\n& Band II, or Basic Laws of Arithmetic (1893/1903),\nwithin the logic that he first developed in Begriffsschrift,\nor at least within a straightforward extension of this logic obtained\nby expanding the system with value-ranges and logical laws that govern\nthem.\n\nIf one is interested in Frege\u2019s philosophy of mathematics, then\nthis story is perhaps adequate. But if one\u2019s interest is instead\naimed at Frege\u2019s philosophy of logic, then the tale just\nsketched is woefully inadequate. The reason is simply this: The\nlogical system found in Grundgesetze is in fact significantly\ndifferent from the system found in Begriffsschrift. There is\nno doubt that Frege arrived at the system given in\nGrundgesetze by attending to various inadequacies and\nlimitations of the system given in Begriffsschrift. But the\ndifferences between the two logics, both in terms of technical details\nand in terms of philosophical interpretation, are too substantial to\nbe compatible with the idea that Frege, over the course of his career,\nchampioned a single, uniform logical system which he merely extended\nin various ways when his logicist project required him to do so.\nAttending to these differences is important, since Frege\u2019s\ninvention of higher-order quantificational logic is typically marked\nas occurring upon the publication of Begriffsschrift, yet\nmany of the distinctive\u2014some might say\nidiosyncratic\u2014features of his logic only appear in the later\nsystem of Grundgesetze\n\nThese features include the claim that sentences refer to truth values;\nthe precise type system of objects, first-level, second-level, and\nthird-level functions, concepts, and relations; and the introduction\nof distinct first- and higher-order quantifiers that range over these\ndifferent types respectively. These aspects of the later logic of\nGrundgesetze are not mere additions to, or clarifications of,\nthe earlier logic of Begriffsschrift. On the contrary, the\ndifferences between the two systems entail that there are strings of\nsymbols that are theorems of the logic of Begriffsschrift,\nbut fail to be theorems of the logic of Grundgesetze. We will\nsee an important example of this\u2014one discussed by Frege\nhimself\u2014in what follows.\n\nBefore diving in, some observations on notation, terminology, and\ngoals are in order. First, some authors, such as Heck (2012), have\nused the term \u201cBegriffsschrift\u201d in a\nsystematically ambiguous way, writing it in italics\n(Begriffsschrift) when referring to the work, and writing it\nnon-italicized when referring to the (presumed single) logical system\nat work in all of Frege\u2019s writings. This approach will not work\nhere, hence we will continue to refer to the two systems in question\nas the logic of Begriffsschrift and the logic of\nGrundgesetze respectively.\n\nSecond, some translators have rendered Frege\u2019s\n\u201cdeutscher Buchstabe\u201d as \u201cGothic\nletter\u201d, others as \u201cGerman letter\u201d, and some have\nrendered \u201clateinischer Buchstabe\u201d as \u201cLatin\nletter\u201d, others as \u201cRoman letter\u201d. Nothing\nphilosophical hangs on this, it is merely a matter of stylistic\ndifference, hence I have left these as is in translations, but will\nuse, in each case, the latter terminology in my discussion.\n\nThird, we should emphasize that in both works Frege is operating with\na very different conception of the methods and goals of logic than the\nconception usually at work within modern research on the topic. Warren\nGoldfarb describes the modern conception of logic, which he calls the\nschematic conception, and which he argues we inherited from\n(among others) Tarski and Quine, as being concerned primarily with\ndiscovering properties of and relations holding between logical\nschemata within this-or-that formal language, and secondarily with\ndetermining whether sentences of natural language can be translated as\ninstances of such a schema with this or that feature. The conception\nof logic that is at work in the Begriffsschrift and\nGrundgesetze, however, which Goldfarb calls the\nuniversalist conception, is quite different. On the\nuniversalist conception, logic is interested in stating and proving\ngeneral, universally valid logical laws applicable to any subject\nmatter whatsoever. Simply put, on the modern, schematic conception of\nlogic, the subject matter of logic is sentences (or schemas, or\npropositions, or some other type of linguistic entity) and\nthe goal is to discover laws governing the properties of, and\nrelations between, sentences (or schemas, or propositions, etc.). On\nFrege\u2019s universalist conception, however, the goal is not to\ndiscover universal truths about language, but rather to discover\nuniversal truths about the world (Goldfarb 2010).\n\nFinally, although Frege only provides a comprehensive presentation of\nhis logic twice, in Begriffsschrift and then in the early\nparts of Grundgesetze, he discusses aspects of his logic in a\nnumber of other works, including \u201cFunction and Concept\u201d,\n\u201cSense and Reference\u201d, and \u201cConcept and\nObject\u201d (about which more below), but also in a number of less\nwell-known essays in which he explicitly discusses the differences\nbetween his own system(s) and the work of his contemporaries. These\ninclude (but are not necessarily limited to) \u201cBoole\u2019s\nLogical Calculus and the Concept-script\u201d (1880/81),\n\u201cBoole\u2019s Logical Formula Language and my\nConcept-script\u201d (1881), \u201cOn the Scientific Justification\nof a Conceptual Notation\u201d (1882a), \u201cOn the Aim of the\n\u2018Conceptual Notation\u2019\u201d (1882b), and \u201cOn Mr.\nPeano\u2019s Conceptual Notation and My Own\u201d (1897). These\nessays not only provide additional insights into the development of\nFrege\u2019s logic(s) and his philosophy of logic, but also contain\nvigorous (and compelling) defenses of the superiority of\nFrege\u2019s much-maligned notation over the notation of\nFrege\u2019s contemporaries (arguments that apply equally well, in\nmany respects, when comparing Frege\u2019s notation to our modern\nbackwards-\u201cE\u201d (\\(\\exists\\)) and\nupside-down-\u201cA\u201d (\\(\\forall\\)) notation!) Those who wish to\ncontinue their study of Frege\u2019s logic beyond the material\ncontained in this essay should consult not only\nBegriffsschrift and Grundgesetze, but these works as\nwell.\n",
