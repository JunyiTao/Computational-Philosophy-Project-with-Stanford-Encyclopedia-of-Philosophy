In this article, the term \u201cTiantai\u201d will be\nused to refer to the philosophical ideas developed from the sixth to\neleventh centuries by this school, as expounded in the writings of its\nthree most representative figures: Tiantai Zhiyi (538\u2013597),\nJingxi Zhanran (711\u2013782) and Siming Zhili (960\u20131028).\n\nTo translate Tiantai\u2019s rather technical scholastic terminology\nand its typically Buddhist soteriological orientation into something\napproaching traditional philosophical categories, we can start by\nidentifying a few hashtag themes that are characteristic of Tiantai\nthinking. Tiantai is a thoroughgoing contextualism, regarding the\nontological status and identity of all entities as deriving entirely\nfrom their contexts, their relationships to other entities. It\nis a thoroughgoing holism, regarding these dispositive\nrelationships as incapable of definitive limitation to any finite\nsubset of what exists. It is a thoroughgoing monism,\nrejecting any notion of distinct ontological categories that are\nirreducible to one another. It is a theory of thoroughgoing\nimmanence, rejecting any possibility of any independently existing\ntranscendent realms entirely beyond what is present in immediate\nexperience. This involves a commitment to the\nclaims that all entities of any kind are impermanent,\nthat what each entity ultimately is is constitutively\nambiguous, and there exist no irreducible or\nprimary substances. Epistemologically this entails thoroughgoing\nskepticism about all unconditional claims, and thoroughgoing\nanti-realism. Ethically it implies a thoroughgoing renunciation of all\nfinite aims, as well as thoroughgoing repudiation of all determinate\nmoral rules, moral consequences, and moral virtues.\n\nBut all of these descriptions are potentially very misleading, since\nour understanding of each of these points must be thoroughly modified\nby the most characteristic premise of Tiantai thought of all, which\ndetermines the meaning we intend for the term\n\u201cthoroughgoing\u201d here: the idea of\n\u201cself-recontextualization\u201d. As we\u2019ll see in detail\nbelow, this is a thinking-through of the basic notion of universal\ncontextualization itself and its constitutive role in the construction\nof all identities, to the point of seeing it to entail the ambiguating\nof the identity not only of the contextualized but also of the\ncontextualizer. This notion brings with it a kind of turnaround\nwhereby the full expression of any element of experience, indeed the\nthorough consideration of any determinate entity at all, intrinsically\nentails its self-overcoming and self-negation, amounting to its\nreversal: it is found to include just what it had initially appeared\nto exclude. This turn of thought may be termed dialectical,\nbut in a way that differs from both Hegelian and Marxian notions of\ndialectics in that it is neither teleologically progressive nor\nhierarchical. It has roots in (1) indigenous Chinese interest in the\n\u201creversals\u201d observed in the cycles of nature,\nconceptualized according to the na\u00efve ancient generalization that\nwhen anything is pushed to its own extreme it will\n\u201creverse\u201d, that an increase in a thing\u2019s extension\nor intensity leads to its self-undermining (e,g., it keeps getting\ncolder until it gets coldest, and then it starts getting warmer), and\nin (2) the sophisticated ruminations on the nature of conditionality\ndeveloped in the Emptiness and Two Truths doctrines as expressed in\nIndian Buddhist logic. What this means is that \u201cthoroughgoing\ncontextualism\u201d will in Tiantai reverse into an\nassertion of the self-validation of every entity without exception,\nthat \u201cthoroughgoing holism\u201d will in Tiantai self-reverse\nalso into thoroughgoing individualism, \u201cthoroughgoing\nmonism\u201d also into thoroughgoing pluralism, \u201cthoroughgoing\nimmanentism\u201d also into thoroughgoing transcendentalism, along\nwith a claim that these two extremes are, when fully thought through,\nactually synonyms for one another. It will mean that for all finite\nconditional entities, exceptionless impermanence is seen to be also\nexceptionless eternalism, exceptionless anti-substantialism is seen to\nbe also exceptionless substantialism, exceptionless anti-realism is\nseen to be also exceptionless realism, again supplemented by a claim\nabout the interchangeability of these two seemingly opposed claims.\nSimilarly, thoroughgoing skepticism about all claims is seen to be\nalso a thoroughgoing \u201ctrivialism\u201d (the claim that all\npossible claims are true), thoroughgoing anti-realism also a\nfanatically absolute realism even for the most fleeting appearances,\nthoroughgoing renunciation of finite aims, moral rules, moral\nconsequences and moral virtues is seen to be also an exceptionless\nacceptance of all finite aims and the endorsement of all determinate\nmoral rules, consequences and virtues.\n\nWhen the dust from these turnarounds settles, Tiantai ends up with a\nunique view of the structure of reality: every event, function or\ncharacteristic occurring in any experience anywhere is the action of\nall sentient and insentient beings working together. Every instant of\nexperience is the whole of reality manifesting in this particular\nform, as this particular entity or experience. Each such\ninstant is however no mere accidental, dispensable form; rather, it is\nitself unconditional and ineradicable, is eternal and omnipresent.\nMoreover, this \u201cwhole of reality\u201d is irreducibly multiple\nand irreducibly unified at once, in the following way: all possible\nconflicting, contrasted and axiologically varied aspects are\nirrevocably present\u2014in the sense of\n\u201cfindable\u201d\u2014in and as each of these individual\ndeterminate totality-effects. Good and evil, delusion and\nenlightenment, Buddhahood and deviltry, are all \u201cinherently\nentailed\u201d in each and every event. These multiple entities are\nnot \u201csimply located\u201d even virtually or conceptually: the\n\u201cwhole\u201d which is the agent performing every experience is\nnot a collection of these various \u201cinherently entailed\u201d\nentities or qualities arrayed side by side, like coins in a pocket.\nRather, they are \u201cintersubsumptive\u201d. That is, any one of\nthem subsumes all the others, and yet, because of the view of what\n\u201csubsumption\u201d actually is, each is subsumed by each of the\nothers as well: all relation is subsumption, and all subsumption is\nintersubsumption. Each part is the whole, each quality subsumes all\nother qualities, and yet none are ever eradicable. A Buddha in the\nworld makes the world all Buddha, saturated in every locus with the\nquality \u201cBuddhahood\u201d; a devil in the world makes the world\nall devil, permeated with \u201cdeviltry\u201d. Both Buddha and\ndevil are always in the world. So every event in the world is always\nboth entirely Buddhahood and entirely deviltry.\nEvery moment of experience is always completely delusion, evil and\npain, through and through, and also completely enlightenment, goodness\nand joy, through and through.\n\nTraditional Buddhism gives a rather commonsensical account of sentient\nexperience: every moment of sentient experience is a sensory apparatus\nencountering an object, giving rise thereby to a particular moment of\ncontentful awareness. But in the Tiantai view, each of these\nthree\u2014sense organ, object, this moment of consciousness\u2014is\nitself the Absolute, the entirety of reality, expressed without\nremainder in the peculiar temporary form of sense organ, of object, of\nthis consciousness. Hence each moment of every being\u2019s\nexperience is redescribed, to paraphrase a canonical early Tiantai\nwork, as follows:\n\n\nThe absolute totality encounters the absolute totality, and the result\nis the arising of the absolute totality.\n(\u6cd5\u754c\u5c0d\u6cd5\u754c\u8d77\u6cd5\u754c)\n\n\nThe Absolute, the whole of reality, is one and eternal, always the\nsame and omnipresent, but it is also the kind of whole that divides\nfrom itself, encounters itself, arises anew each moment, engenders\nitself as the transient flux of each unique and individual\nmoment of experience of every sentient being.\n\nHow this view is established, and what its consequences are, is what\nis to be explained in this article.\n", "toc": [{"#ConOntAmb": "1.

Contextualism and Ontological Ambiguity\n\nThe meta-level claim about self-recontextualization as self-reversal,\nwhich applies at all levels to all Tiantai doctrines, is itself the\nconsequence of some considerations concerning contextualism, holism\nand conditionality, with which it is thus convenient to begin our\nexposition. The heart of the matter, the most fundamental and\nfar-reaching renovation of Buddhism accomplished by the Tiantai\nSchool, is the move from the Two Truths model to a Three\nTruths one. The Two Truths is an epistemological and pedagogical\nheuristic in most Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, but in Tiantai the\nThree Truths are taken to be a necessary logical entailment of any\nproposed determinacy, and thus to apply equally to any possible\nontological, epistemological and ethical entities. They can be\nsummarized by the claim that no entity can be either the same as or\ndifferent from any other entity. This relation of\nneither-sameness-nor-difference, a formula used by many\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist schools but often interpreted as applying\nnot to \u201cConventional Truth\u201d but only to \u201cUltimate Truth\u201d (on which see\nbelow), and thus understood simply as an instance of\napophasis (i.e., the claim that only negations or silence\nare truly appropriate descriptions of ultimate reality, since\nno finite or relative predicates can be legitimately applied\nto what is infinite or absolute), is in Tiantai instead developed\ninto what might be described as the \u201casness\u201d relation,\napplying to all putative or real entities without exception, affecting\neven what is within the scope of Conventional Truth: each determinate\nthing is the totality of all other possible things as this\nthing. The non-sameness implies that the specific characteristics of\nall other things are in some sense discoverable in each thing, that\nall their manifold properties and functions will also be\nsimultaneously operative there.\n\nA simple thought experiment may draw out the implications of this\nidea. Imagine that you come upon what looks like a white marble lying\non the ground. You experience it as round, as small, as white, and\nimmediately you construct a lived attitude toward it\u2014something\nthat can be picked up, rolled, played with, pocketed. But then you go\nto pick it up, and find that it is stuck to the ground. You cannot\nlift it. You try to dig it out, and find that it extends downward,\nfurther than you can dig: it is the tip of a larger item. It appears\nto be a long rod or cylindrical pipe of some kind. But as you dig\nfurther, you find that after about five inches of narrow thinness it\nstarts to expand outward; it is a spire on top of a cone. This cone\nexpands outward as you keep digging down. When you get about twenty\nfeet down, the cone ends, embedded in a soft, scaly material. Then the\nearth rumbles and an enormous two-horned monster emerges from\nunderground; it is 500 feet tall, and each of its horns is twenty feet\nhigh, with a long sharp tip. You had been digging out one of the\nhorns. What you had seen as a marble on the ground was in fact the\nvery tip of one of the horns. Now look again at that tip. You had\nexperienced it as round. But it turns out it was not round at all: it\nis sharp. Yet it has not changed at all: you are still seeing what you\nsaw. It is not white either: the tip had looked white against the\nground, but now, looking at the monster\u2019s horn as whole, you see\nit as a pattern of mostly green spots interspersed here and there with\nwhite: looked at as a whole, the horn, including its tip, looks green.\nNor is it movable, pocketable, playwithable\u2014it is rather\ndangerous, razor sharp, to be avoided. And yet nothing of what you saw\nwas taken away: it was just supplemented with further information,\nwith its larger context.\n\nTiantai views all things this way. Normally you might make some\nqualifications in order to preserve your view that some facts are\nunambiguous (indeed, to some extent this process is precisely what\nphilosophy traditionally is); you might say \u201cthe tip,\nconsidered in isolation, is indeed round\u201d. The usual\nprocedure is to interpose the distinction between \u201chow it\nappears\u201d and \u201chow it really is\u201d, some form of\nreality-appearance distinction. But the most important consequence of\nthe transformation of the Two Truths into the Three Truths is the\nwholesale dismissal of the appearance-reality distinction. Tiantai\nwould reject the privileging of either considering in isolation or\nconsidering in any single particular connection; any of these would be\nlegitimate in some heuristic (upayic) contexts, but none\ncould be non-arbitrarily assigned the role of representing what is the\n\u201creally the case\u201d, simpliciter. To see something\nis to see \u201cnot-all\u201d of it. We are always seeing a little\nfragment of the world, but every bit of the world is changed by the\nfact that it is a part of the world, is recontextualized by the rest\nof the world, by the rest of space and the rest of time. In fact, if\nwe ever saw all, we would see nothing. For to see, to take something\nas \u201cthere\u201d, as \u201creal\u201d, is to place it within a\ncontext, to contrast it to something outside of itself, something\nwhich is not it. To see all is to see nothing. As in the case of\n\u201cfire\u201d and \u201cwater\u201d above, if someone were to\nsay that the entire universe is \u201cround\u201d, this would\nrequire changing the meaning of \u201cround\u201d. This round would\nnot be round: for round requires a non-round outside it to be\nround. It would have to be bordered by something to shape it into\nroundness, but the universe would also include that\noutside-the-roundness part. If someone were to say the entire universe\nwere sharp, this would also make no sense. This sharp would not be\nsharp; for sharp requires a non-sharp outside it to be sharp.\nTo say the whole universe is sharp, then, means no more and no less\nthan saying the whole universe is round. We can make no specific\ndeterminations about the whole, about the entire universe, for that\noutside of which nothing exists; for all particular specifications\nrequire a contrast to something outside of them. Everything we can say\nor think comes from the realm of the finite, and cannot be applied to\nthe infinite. But the Tiantai point is that we cannot speak of\nanything finite without also involving some determination of the\nWhole, of the infinite. If we were to say this thing is sharp, we\nwould have to be assuming that \u201cthe whole universe is such that\nthis thing is sharp\u201d. We cannot say that: the whole universe\ncannot be \u201csuch that this marble is sharp\u201d any more than\nthe whole universe can be \u201csharp\u201d. But this also means we\ncannot say the whole universe is \u201csuch that this marble is\nnot-sharp\u201d. Either is equally legitimate, either is equally\nillegitimate. What we can say, then, is that this marble appears to be\nround, but round is such that it is always turning out also to be more\nthan round, to be non-round, and vice versa. Roundness is moretoitive.\nRound and non-round intersubsume each other.\n\nIn short, roundness is present as every non-roundness, and as\nmoretoitivity; moretoitivity is present as roundness, and as every\nnon-roundness. This it means to say \u201croundness and\nnon-roundness are neither same nor different.\u201d\n\nTo clarify this, consider the following:\n\nWhat is the following figure?\n\n\u039f\n\nWhat is that \u201csame\u201d figure in the diagram below?\n\n\u22122 \u22121 \u039f \u00a01 \u00a02\n\nWhat is it now?\n\n\n\n\n\nM\n\n \n\n\n\nN\n\n \n\n\u22122\n\u22121\n\u039f\n\u00a01\n\u00a02 \n\n\n\nP\n\n \n\n\n\nQ\n\n  \n\n\nHow about now:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u039f \n\n\n\nM\n\n \n\n\n\nN\n\n \n\n\u22122\n\u22121\n\u039f\n\u00a01\n\u00a02\n\u039f \n\n\n\nP\n\n \n\n\n\nQ\n\n  \n\n\nWhen we looked at that round figure in isolation, it may have\npresented itself immediately and unreflectively in accordance with our\nhabits or proximate mental acts; if we had been thinking about numbers\na moment ago, it might appear simply and unambiguously as\n\u201czero\u201d, if about letters as the letter \u201co\u201d, if\nabout shapes as a \u201ccircle\u201d. When a single explicit context\nwas added in the second diagram, it had a clear and definite identity:\nit was the number zero. But when we added another context at the same\ntime, in the third diagram, the figure became ambiguous: it could now\nbe read as either a zero or the letter O. As we keep adding more\ncontexts, its identity becomes more and more ambiguous; in the final\ndiagram above, we can point to the initial circular figure and say,\nvalidly, \u201cThis is a triangle\u201d\u2014for it is the\nvertex of a triangle formed with the two other, non-contiguous and\nnon-proximate, circles. Who knows what other circles there are out in\nthe world, and what other figures this thing right here is\nactually forming? When we consider all things in the universe at the\nsame time, the initial identities we assigned to them are supplemented\nby more and more ambiguity. Looking at just the single series of\nletters, is was a zero: this is local coherence. When we see this cup\nsimply as a cup, we are doing the same thing: ignoring a lot of other\nfactors, contexts, points of view, ways of viewing, and narrowing down\nthe relevant factors to allow it to appear as a single unambiguous\nsomething: a cup. If we consider the molecules of which it is made, or\nthe energy it expresses, or the uses to which it might be put in the\ncontext of various narratives, or its deep past and deep future, its\n\u201ccupness\u201d becomes ambiguous: it is simultaneously lots of\nother things, part of many different stories. It is a blip on the\nscreen of energy transformations, or a murder weapon, or an art\nobject, or a doorstop. The same is true of yourself, and your actions\nright now. They are unambiguous only to the extent that we narrow our\nvision around them (one way we can narrow our vision, of course, is to\ndo philosophy; one of the narratives in which we are contextualizing\nour experience might be a conceptual system presupposing the sorting\nout of essences, attributes, accidents, substantial forms or what have\nyou, and distinguishing appearances from reality accordingly, so that\nit appears to be \u201cessentially\u201d a cup and only\n\u201caccidentally\u201d a murder weapon and only \u201cappearing\nto be\u201d a revelation from Baal). This is the meaning of Emptiness\nin Tiantai: ontological ambiguity. The term \u201cambiguity\u201d\nusually refers only to how we see things. We assume that, in\nthemselves, everything simply is what it is; but we may have an\nunclear view of it; we can\u2019t yet tell if it\u2019s\nthis or that. We assume that, at least in principle, it must be one or\nthe other. The idea of Emptiness is the idea that this is true\n\u201contologically\u201d: that is, it pertains to the very being of\nthings. To say they are empty does not mean they are a blank\u2014for\nthat would be a definite something, a specific exclusion of all\ndeterminate content, which is, ipso facto, itself a\ndeterminate content. Emptiness here means rather that they are, in\nthemselves, ambiguous. Again, this is also to say that\neverything is more than it seems to be, or rather\nconstitutively more than it can seem to be, no matter what\nangles it is seen from, no matter how thoroughly it is known, no\nmatter how comprehensive a sum of information is gathered about it. It\nhas the character of being a \u201csomething\u201d (a cup, a chair,\nan elephant), with a number of specifiable characteristics, but every\n\u201csomething\u201d, just to be there as something, has the\nadditional characteristic of \u201cmoretoitivity\u201d\u2014of\nalways overflowing whatever is determined about it, of being\nmore than what can be seen from any angle.\n\nThis \u201cmore\u201d however, does not leave the original\n\u201cknown\u201d part unchanged. Rather, it recontextualizes it. We\nare always seeing the tip of an iceberg. But even the\n\u201ctip\u201d is no longer what we thought it was before we knew\nit was a tip of something more. The key here is that there is\nno total decontextualization, that leaving one context is always\nsimply entering another context; contextual relations do not require\nphysical contiguity, and the empty space surrounding a given thing\ndoes not cut it off from further recontextualizations but rather is\nitself a context, and an illimitable one that opens into infinite\nalternate contexts.\n2. The Three Truths: Emptiness, Provisional Positing and the Center (\u7a7a\u5047\u4e2d kong, jia, zhong)\n\nThese analogies, homely and somewhat goofy as they are, may\nstart to give some sense of the intuitions that\nundergird Tiantai\u2019s architectonic philosophical system,\nwhich may help orient us as we move into the actual technical\narguments and commitments developed there. This is especially\nimportant in the Tiantai case, as the conclusions to which its\ntheoretical edifice lead will initialy strike many if not\nmost readers as wildly outlandish and counterintuitive; some attention\nto these everyday experiences\u2014coming upon something in the\nworld, having some tentative grasp of what it is but with a built-in\nincompletion clause pointed toward the future, finding out more about\nit, reinterpreting and recalibrating our understanding\naccordingly, adjusting our foregroundings and backgroundings, and\nso on\u2014may help to spur some reflections on the\nconcepts normally brought to bear in interpreting\nthese experiences. It also helps us understand the Tiantai\nclaim that its most shocking stipuations are nothing special, not\nthe bizarro-world privileges of some remote ontological plane,\nbut are rather inescapable entailments of everyday experience of\nall sentient beings\u2014for this process of things appearing one way and\nturning out another is almost a definition of \u201cexperience\u201d as\nsuch. Nevertheless, analogies are never perfect,\nalways partially mirroring the structure they are intended to\nexplicate but never doing so completely, and we must not\nallow the attractive accessibility of such examples to mislead us\ninto resting content with only a loose sense of the logical\nentailments of this sort of thinking. For a more rigorous grasp\nof the reasoning on which so many of\nthe outrageous epistemological, ontological and\nsoteriological claims of this school rest, we must approach the\nmeaning of \u201cneither-same-nor-different\u201d more systemtaically.\n2.1 Outline of the Three Truths Argument: Getting to \u201cNeither-Same-Nor-Different\u201d\n\nWe can reconstruct the argument for this claim as follows:\n\nFor anything to be what it is, it must be mutually exclusive with\nwhatever it is not. If it has aspects or qualities in common with\nanything else, it is nonetheless stipulated to be specifically itself\nnot insofar as it has these in common, and thus is indistinguishable\nfrom the other things that share them, but insofar as it is different\nfrom them.\nTo be is to be determinate. To be determinate is to be finite,\nnon-all. To be finite is to be conditional. Anything strictly\nunconditional would ipso facto be omnipresent (no particular\nplace rather than another can be the \u201ccondition\u201d for its\nexistence) and always occurring (no particular time rather than\nanother can be the \u201ccondition\u201d for its existence), and\nthus indistinguishable from anything else. This would be equivalent to\nnot being determinate at all, for it would be impossible for an\nunconditional entity to be mutually exclusive with anything, since\nthat exclusion would then have to be a \u201ccondition\u201d of its\nexistence.\nAny entity must thus be copresent with some otherness; it must\nexist in a world that includes something that is not it, i.e., (by\nitem #1), something that is mutually exclusive with it (even if just\nthe empty space around it). Some form of copresence-with-otherness is\nan essential characteristic of the existence of all entities.\nAll forms of relation, including relations of causality and of\nconceptual contrast, are instances of this necessary\ncopresence-in-the-world.\nThe conditions from which it must be different but related include\nnot only immediately contiguous causally efficient factors, but also\nprior states of affairs. More searchingly, the constitutive copresent\notherness cannot be to non-X in general, for this would\nmerely be a repetition of the determination of X itself, in\nreverse; to the extent that there is no more in non-X than\nthe negation of X, no new content is provided by the\ncontrast, which therefore presupposes X. Rather, the\nexclusions that make up the determination of X must be\nspecific other determinations, other exclusions; they must in\nprinciple include anything at all that the entity in question is\ndifferent from: to be determinate as X is a specific\nexclusion of all specific non-X things and states. We have\ngreater knowledge of what the essence of a dog is by learning more\nabout each and every particular thing that the dog is not, how it\ndiffers specifically from a cat, from a hedgehog, from a table, from a\ntowel\u2026. (Our knowledge is thus always constitutively partial\nand in-process; knowing X is always being poised to know more\nabout X. Knowledge per se is non-omniscience.)\nHowever, all copresence-in-the-world, all conditioning, all\nrelation, all causality between two entities requires some overlap or\ninterface between them. There must be some place, thing, time, medium\nor concept that simultaneously includes them both, or which they both\ninclude. Any two entities must have something in common to succeed in\nbeing copresent\u2014to have a causal relation or to even be\ncontrasted.\nBut no genuinely distinct entities, insofar as they are distinct\nand thus determinate, have anything in common.\nHence two genuinely mutually exclusive entities can have no\nrelation of conditioning one another.\nHence there are no genuinely mutually exclusive entities. Thus the\nnature of determination stipulated in item #1 must be supplemented.\nThis rewrite of the nature of determination is the Three Truths.\nWhatever appears to be, i.e., to be just what it is and nothing\nelse, cannot really be mutually exclusive with whatever it is not.\nX is \u201cnon-different\u201d from non-X. This\nnon-difference is called the Emptiness (\u7a7a kong,\n\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101) of X. For if X is\nnon-different from non-X, it fails to fulfill the condition\nof being X stipulated in item #1, and thus X is\nnot X; X is \u201cempty\u201d.\nBut X is also \u201cnon-same\u201d with non-X.\nEmpirically, if it were the same, there would be no X to be\ncalled non-different: its presence is nothing other than its\nnon-identity with all other states. Logically, the alternative to the\nTiantai view is the default bivalent assumption that either some\nentities exist or that no entities exist; but both existing and\nnon-existing require non-sameness\u2014i.e., the non-sameness between\nexisting and non-existing. Anything determinate is non-same with what\nis not itself, by item #1. This is why there is something rather than\nnothing: even total nothingness would still be determinate and\nnon-same to what it is not, i.e., non-same to somethingness. Nothing\nwould therefore still be something, so the question why there is\nsomething rather than nothing is actually moot. Non-sameness to what\nit is not is analytically necessary to any proposed entity. Even if no\nentity is posited, \u201cno-entity-being-posited\u201d will not\nobtain unless the positing of entities is thereby excluded, and\nnon-sameness is necessary to succeed in excluding the positing of any\nentity. This is non-sameness to non-X is called the\nProvisional Positing or Conventional Truth (\u5047 jia) of\nX.\nThe non-sameness of X and non-X and the\nnon-difference between X and non-X are themselves\nnon-same as one another and non-different from one another. Non-same\nin spite of being non-different is Provisional Positing. Non-different\nin spite of being non-same is Emptiness. These are just reversed ways\nof saying the same thing, but the reversal is itself not negligible.\nThey are two opposite and mutually exclusive senses given to a single\nidentical referent. They are synonymous and yet contrasted. This is\ncalled the Center (\u4e2d zhong).\nX has to be an aspect or part of more than whatever it\nseems to be, and even as a part or aspect it cannot really be just the\nsingle selfsame (i.e., simply and bivalently same or different) part\nor aspect it appears to be.\nBut it also does and must seem to be just this and nothing\nbesides, and can appear only if initially appearing to be mutually\nexclusive with what it is not: to appear is to appear as something,\nwhich is to appear as finite. The whole of which any appearance is a\npart or aspect can never appear simpliciter, even in thought.\nIt is always appearing as one specific thing (or concept, or thought)\nor another.\nTo be present as X is to not be X, but such that\nthis not-X is showing itself only as X. To be\nX is to exclude non-X but only in such a way as to\nnecessarily involve non-X, which can only be done by showing\nitself exclusively as X.\nThus the Three Truths are:\n\n\nProvisional Positing: Some X is always appearing.\nEmptiness: X is not (only) X.\nThe Center (or Middle, or Mean): The simultaneity, inseparability,\nsameness-as-difference of X appearing and X not\nbeing only X (this is the Center in its simplest formulation,\nas \u201cthe exclusive Center\u201d (\u4f46\u4e2d\ndanzhong) which is itself neither Emptiness nor Provisional\nPositing, is beyond both and more ultimately real than both, but which\ncan appear as either).\n \nA further implication of the Center, called the\n\u201cNon-exclusive Center\u201d (\u4e0d\u4f46\u4e2d budan\nzhong): Any two putatively distinct things, Y and\nX, are also not-same-and-not different from one\nanother. For the Center can never appear simpliciter; it\nalways appears as some specific coherence showing itself, to which it\nis non-different. Provisional Positing is intrinsic to every instance\nof both Emptiness and the Center, and Provisional Positing is always\nsome specific provisional posit (even the abstract concept\n\u201cprovisional positing\u201d, or the abstract concept\n\u201cemptiness\u201d or \u201cthe center\u201d is still a\nspecific provisional posit.) Each provisional posit involves\nevery other provisional posit, specifically. Y is an\ninstantiation of X. X is an instantiation of\nY. All other appearances are thus\n\u201cintersubsumptive\u201d with X. The Center is thus\nultimately not beyond or more real than Emptiness or Provisional\nPositing, but is itself synonymous-as-contrasted with them, such that\njust to be Empty or to Provisionally Posited, or to be any provisional\nposit, is to be the Center, the subsumer and subsumed of all other\nprovisional posits\u2014and vice versa.\n\n2.2 The Self-Overcoming of Holism into Omnireductionism\n\nFrom this we can perhaps see in what way Tiantai is able to stipulate\nat once the self-preserving and the self-overcoming of both holism and\napophasis. First, atomism of any kind\u2014that is, any doctrine that\nstipulates basic indivisible buiding blocks exist whose\nidentities are independent of the relations and wholes into which they\nmay enter\u2014is rejected as unintelligible, and a thorough contextualism\nasserted: things can only be determinate in relation to a context, and\nthere can be no non-arbitrary limiting of the extent and multiplicity\nof contexts, since each context will itself be intelligible only with\nrespect to a larger context. This would seem to lead to a holism of\nsome sort: each apparently isolable thing is really an aspect or\nexpression of some more inclusive whole, and each of these finite\nwholes must be an aspect or expression of a still more inclusive\nwhole. The part is dependent on the whole, the conditional is\ndependent on the unconditional. But the unconditional can have no\nspecific separate identity, not even as \u201cthe unconditional\nper se\u201d. Any determination for the whole turns out to\nself-overturn into other determinations, precisely due to its success\nin being a determination for the exceptionless whole. For example,\nThales says the world is made of water. This is stipulated after first\nisolating other lesser wholes: water, earth, fire, air. Each of these\nwas already a finite whole, involving an alleged collapse from\nappearance to a deeper reality: what appeared to be trees and stones\nand pillars turned out to be part of the larger whole\n\u201cearth\u201d, ways in which earth appears or manifests; what\nappeared to be body-heat and flames and sunshine turned out to be part\nof the larger whole \u201cfire\u201d, ways in which fire appears or\nmanifests. Now Thales says both of these are really parts of a larger\nwhole \u201cwater\u201d, ways in which it appears and manifests. But\neach of these generalizing claims involves a meaning-change\nfor the term in question. \u201cWater\u201d initially meant\n\u201cwhat is not fire, earth, wind, which excludes them,\nwhat is contrasted to them\u201d. After Thales, \u201cwater\u201d\nmeans also \u201cwhat expresses itself sometimes as watery, sometimes\nas fiery, sometimes as earthy, sometimes as windy\u201d. Along comes\nHeraclitus and claims that all is really \u201cfire\u201d.\n\u201cFire\u201d now means also \u201cwhat expresses itself\nsometimes as watery, sometimes as fiery, sometimes as earthy,\nsometimes as windy\u201d. What is intended in claims of this type,\nallowing them to appear to be doing explanatory work, is the\nmaintenance of a distinction between which of these expressions is\nprimary and which secondary, which direct and indirect; but Tiantai\nwould deny that this distinction can be meaningfully maintained once\nthis totalization has been effected. Because each now means the whole,\nthey lose their original meaning, for that meaning was entirely\ndependent on a contrast to what was excluded. If fire is everything,\nthen fire is not fire. If water is everything, then water is not\nwater. If fire is everything, then water is really fire. If water is\neverything, then fire is really water. If fire is really water, then\nwater is really fire. Hence by going through the universalization of\nany determinate entity, we reach the overturning of that\ndetermination into something that expresses itself as all other\ndeterminations, and at the same time undermines its own privileged\nstatus as ultimate foundation, making all other possible\ndeterminations equally unconditional, all-pervasive, universal,\nabsolute. To see the absoluteness of any one entity is thus to\nde-absolutize that entity and also to absolutize every other\nentity.\n2.3 From Two Truths to Three Truths: The Self-Overcoming of Apophasis into Trivialism\n\nThe Three Truths position of Tiantai derives from a particular\nunderstanding of the Two Truths doctrine advanced by Indian Buddhist\nphilosophers of the M\u0101dhyamaka school, interpreted as holding\nthat any specific thing we could say about the world was at best a\n\u201cConventional Truth\u201d, which served as a kind of\n\u201craft\u201d to get beyond it to the \u201cUltimate\nTruth\u201d of Emptiness\u2014determinations of any kind were thus\nat best an indispensable means to get beyond themselves, to be\ndiscarded when their work is done. The stipulation of Emptiness\n(\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101) was itself a raft to get beyond not\nonly all other determinate views but also Emptiness itself as a\n\u201cview\u201d or theory or concept. Ultimate Truth, true\nrealization of Emptiness, was thus at best a celebratory term used to\npoint to an ineffable experience of the liberation from all views, all\ndefinite conceptions of determinate \u201cthings\u201d. The\nmotivation for this was soteriological in a specific, pan-Buddhist\nsense: the goal of all human endeavor, including philosophy, including\nethics, including epistemology, is assumed to be the reduction or\nelimination of suffering. Buddhism claims that this is what\nwe\u2019re always trying to do, but usually in a self-defeating,\nignorant way; it claims to provide a more effective way. Note that\nthis does not make any claim about what is valuable, but rather\naddresses what is assumed to be a necessary entailment of what it\nmeans to consider anything valuable, i.e., what structures desire qua\ndesire. To desire is to value, and suffering is simply the\nnon-satisfaction of our desire. Hence all endeavors are endeavors to\neliminate some suffering, i.e., to satisfy a desire. The\ncharacteristic Buddhist contribution is then to note that desiring any\nconditional object or state is necessarily self-defeating. This is\nbecause to be conditional is to be brought into being by a\nqualitatively distinct, heterogeneous and extrinsic cause. But\nexamined closely, this cannot be a single extrinsic cause,\nfor if any effect were produced by a single cause, that cause and that\neffect would always be copresent\u2014wherever and whenever that\ncause occurred, the effect would also occur. But that would mean that\nthe cause would therefore no longer be extrinsic to the effect; they\nwould be, rather, necessary and intrinsically conjoined, actually two\naspects of a single irreducible entity, which would mean that no\ncausal event actually ever occurs. This means that all conditional\nthings require multiple causes, each of which itself requires multiple\ncauses.\n\nThis introduces an intrinsic instability and inner conflict into\nwhatever exists conditionally, that is, whatever is finite, whatever\nis determinate. The unconditional would have to be omnipresent and\nomnitemporal and indeterminate. But the nature of desire is to have\nspecific conditions of satisfaction: to desire is to require some one\nstate of affairs rather than, to the exclusion of,\nsome other state of affairs\u2014minimally, pleasure instead of\npain. This means all desire qua desire is desire for something\nconditional; otherwise there would be no need for the desire, since\nthe desired state would already always and everywhere be present.\nDesire desires a single effect to the exclusion of any other effect;\nbut the denial of effectivity for any single cause also\nimplies that what is produced by any causal process can never be only\na single effect. For since what is produced is not dependent\nsolely on any single cause, or indeed any finite set of causes\nconsidered as a unit, the production of a new event always requires\nthe conjunction with some hitherto excluded condition. Since by\nhypothesis this new condition is not a consistent part of the original\nset, it will not always be the same, and thus the effect will not be\none and the same; every conjunction will produce its own effects, and\nby hypothesis there is no limit to the set of conjunctions (for that\nwould make them simply a single cause). Less rigorously, it is held\nthat the cross-purposes and conflicting tendencies thus built into any\neffect make it impossible for it to be a stably homogenous entity\nconsistently isolable from the opposite conditional states it means to\nexclude, such as is required by the exclusive structure of specific\ndesires. Whatever is desired must be identifiably present at a\nparticular time and place, and whatever is such is conditional, and\nwhatever is conditional entails impermanence, and thus suffering.\n\nThe pan-Buddhist denial of the existence of a \u201cself\u201d rests\non the same point: the impossibility of single-cause causal events.\nFor the \u201cself\u201d rejected here is precisely the claimant to\nsingle-causality: the agent of actions which putatively requires no\nsecond condition to produce an effect, e.g., to will something, to do\nsomething, to want something, to experience something. The self never\nacts alone, has no independent effects, and thus actually is not a\nself-as-efficacious-agent. \u201cSelf\u201d here essentially means\n\u201ccontroller\u201d. Because there is no single causality, there\nis no single controller, and thus no self. For this reason too,\nsatisfaction of desire is not sustainable. For in doing what the self\ndesires, other causes besides the activity of the self are always also\ninvolved; the effect is not in the self\u2019s control, and thus will\ninevitably contravene its desires, its own causal contributions to the\neffect. Indeed, the early Buddhist analysis of the human condition\namounts to the claim that all desire is really a proxy-version of this\nimpossible desire for control, for single-agent causality, for pure\nautonomy, for selfhood; thus all desire is doomed.\n\nThe same considerations have serious epistemological consequences as\nwell. The Buddhists viewed theoretical stances and philosophical\npositions as themselves objects of desire, of clinging. Since all such\nstances are themselves specific, determinate, they are ipso\nfacto conditional. As conditional, they are ipso facto\nsuffering. Hence attachment to views was seen as a form of suffering\nand an obstacle to liberation. All determinate metaphysical views\nabout how or what things are were to be transcended and left\nbehind.\n\nIn most of the dominant Indian theories, those ideas are granted\ntemporary validity as conventional truths: they are to serve as\n\u201crafts\u201d, to be clung to temporarily, but only because they\nare an effective means of passing beyond themselves. This includes\nboth specific Buddhist doctrines and also ordinary conventional speech\n(necessary for even communicating Buddhist ideas). Whatever ideas do\nnot lead to their own abandonment in this way (and hence do not lead\nto the end of suffering) do not count even as conventional\ntruths\u2014for example, 1) metaphysical and religious theories about\nthe Absolute, or unconditional claims about the world as a whole and\n2) non-conventional views of things in the world, claims that\ncontravene ordinary language of the community. There tends to be a\nkind of hierarchy in the Indian Two Truths theory: first, plain\nfalsehood, including all philosophical theories about reality and\nunconventional views. Then conventional truth, which includes ordinary\ndaily life ideas about self and other, cause and effect and so on, and\nalso Buddhist ideas about suffering, the Four Noble Truths, non-self,\nand even \u201cEmptiness\u201d considered as a concept. These ideas\nlead beyond themselves, instrumentally, to the experience of\nEmptiness, which is liberation from all views. The conventional truths\nhad an instrumental value, but none were really \u201ctrue\u201d\nabout things\u2014Emptiness meant that all of them were, in the most\nultimate sense, false. Also, there are really only one or two kinds of\nconventional truth: first, common sense daily speech, the correct\ngeneral names for things as used in the daily life of your particular\ncommunity, and second, Buddhist ideas. The reason these count as\n\u201ctruths\u201d is because they are useful in leading us to\nliberation from suffering\u2014and in leading us to liberation from\nthese ideas themselves. \u201cTrue\u201d propositions are\npropositions that have the power to lead beyond themselves.\n\nThis led to a somewhat paradoxical situation, on several levels. There\nwas always a problem in Emptiness theory: Emptiness was supposed to be\nnot a \u201cview\u201d at all, to predicate nothing about reality.\nBut if it does anything at all, if it negates or\nexcludes any other view, it is, in the Tiantai view, still a kind\nof view. For to be something in particular is just to exclude\nsomething else in particular. That is all a\n\u201cthing\u201d is, that is all a \u201cview\u201d is. To be\nsomething just is to exclude something else; nothing more is\nrequired to count as a being. Pre-Tiantai Emptiness theory gets into\nan infinite regress, chasing its tail around the problem of the\ntranscendence of Emptiness: no statement can represent it, even\n\u201call things are Empty\u201d. It is purely and totally above and\nbeyond anything that can be thought or said, all ordinary experience\nof identities in the world. It is a negation that is supposed to bear\nno relation at all to what it negates, to entirely escape the system\nof relations, of conditionality. Emptiness is supposed to be strictly\n\u201cinconceivable\u201d. In Tiantai, this problem disappears.\nEmptiness is still very important, but it is simply a\nconditional assertion of unconditionality. We do not have all\nthe conditionality (specifiability, particularity) on one side and all\nthe unconditionality (transcendence, inconceivability) on the other.\nEverything, every experience, every identity, every action, is in the\nsame boat: they are all both conditional and unconditional, both\nconceivable and inconceivable. The thought, experience, concept\n\u201cEmptiness\u201d is also both conditional and unconditional,\nboth conceivable and inconceivable, like \u201cwater\u201d and\n\u201cfire\u201d in our example about. Emptiness is an especially\nefficient marker of self-exploded holism, the term that applies most\neasily everywhere and thus ultimately nowhere, allowing all other\nterms to do the same. It is Provisionally Posited, which means it is\nat least locally coherent (conditional, determinate, conceivable), but\nit itself is also Empty, which means it is globally incoherent\n(unconditional, indeterminate, inconceivable). It appears in\nexperience as something in particular (locally coherent as precisely\nthis word and this thought \u201cEmptiness\u201d), but this, like\nevery other local coherence, is haunted by its own inseparable nimbus\nof infinite outsides, infinite contexts, each of which differently\ncontextualizes it and thus bestows on it alternate identities: there\nis more to it than any single concept, including the concept\n\u201cEmptiness\u201d, can hold. Emptiness is, to use a word coined\nfor just this Tiantai usage, \u201cmoretoitivity\u201d (i.e., the\nquality of always constitutively having more-to-it): and\nmoretoitivity is itself moretoitive. It appears not just as\nmoretoitivity, but as specific identities, something more, above and\nbeyond, simple moretoitivity as such. Ambiguity is itself ambiguous:\nfire is not just fire, it is ambiguous; but the ambiguity is not just\nambiguity, it is also fire. This applies to everything else as well.\nLocal coherence and global coherence (Provisional Positing and\nEmptiness) are just two ways of saying the same thing.\n\nIn the Tiantai \u201cThree Truths\u201d theory, instead of\nconcluding that every particular view and thing is false, we conclude\nthat all is, ultimately, true. Every possible view is equally a truth.\nThere is no longer a hierarchy between the levels, and no category of\nplain falsehood. \u201cConventional Truth\u201d in Tiantai is not\nsomething to be left behind when we reach enlightenment, but rather\nwhat is obtained and mastered and intensified there. Moreover, nothing\nis left out of it\u2014all possible statements, viewpoints, ideas,\nconcepts, positions are conventional truths. The criterion is still\nthe same: all things can be used as \u201cskillful means\u201d to\nlead to Buddhahood. So now we have Three Truths, which are not a\nraft-like instrument to get beyond all statements and concepts, and a\nfinal higher truth that allows us to have no biased and particular\nview of things, but rather as three true ways of viewing any\nparticular thing. It is not a raft to get beyond all rafts, but a raft\nthat leads to the raft factory that makes and houses all rafts, and\nallows one to move at will from any raft to any other raft, including\nthe initial one. However you may be viewing a particular part of the\nworld or the world as a whole, it is \u201cconventionally\u201d\ntrue. There are not just a few conventional truths, but an infinite\nnumber of them, even when they are directly opposed and contradictory.\nSo in Two Truths theory, we would say that \u201cthis is a cup\u201d\nis conventionally true, and \u201cthis cup is empty\u201d is a\nhigher conventional truth, which finally leads us to a direct\ninconceivable experience of the emptiness of this cup, freedom from\nclinging to any view at all of this cup, which is the liberation from\nall suffering. If someone were to point to this \u201ccup\u201d and\nsay, \u201cThis is an elephant\u201d, however, that would not even\nbe a conventional truth, because that is not how most people think of\nit, it is neither the ordinary speech of the language community, nor a\nBuddhist term designed to lead beyond itself. That would be a plain\nerror. And if someone said, \u201cThis is an expression of the will\nof God\u201d, that would also be an error, not even a conventional\ntruth, since it tried to make a claim beyond that of conventional\nusage to an ultimate, universally applicable, absolute truth. But in\nTiantai Three Truths theory, it is just as true to say, \u201cThis is\nan elephant\u201d or \u201cThis is the Will of Baal\u201d as to say\n\u201cThis is a cup\u201d. And neither of these is less true than\nsaying, \u201cThis is empty\u201d, or indeed any less true than\n\u201cexperiencing\u201d the emptiness of this cup/elephant. In both\ncases, what we have is a locally coherent way of viewing this\nthing\u2014it just means that it looks that way from some\nperspective, within some set of parameters, for some length of time.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore whether those parameters are shared by\nthe common sense of a particular community or speech group; all that\nmatters is that it is possible to make it look that way, that it looks\nthat way from anywhere, for even one moment. In Two\nTruths and Emptiness theory, nothing is really true. In Tiantai Three\nTruths theory, everything is true. We don\u2019t need an\nextra \u201cEmptiness\u201d outside of this locally coherent way of\nseeing things; Emptiness just means that whatever is locally\ncoherent is also, ipso facto, globally\nincoherent. That is, when all factors are taken into\nconsideration, the original way any thing appears is no longer\nunambiguously present, but it restored as a raft leading to all other\nrafts, including itself, as ineradicable aspects of all reality, of\nany reality.\n3. Transformative Self-Recontextualization (\u958b\u6b0a\u986f\u5be6 kaiquanxianshi)\n\nThis strange \u201cneither-same-nor-different\u201d structure of the\nThree Truths is to be understood in accordance with another key\nTiantai concept, \u201copening the provisional to reveal the\nreal\u201d (\u958b\u6b0a\u986f\u5be6 kaiquan\nxianshi). This is a way of further specifying the relation\nbetween local coherence and global incoherence, which are not only\nsynonymous, but also irrevocably opposed, and indeed identical only by\nmeans of their opposition and mutual exclusivity. Provisional truth is\nthe antecedent, the premise, and indeed in a distinctive sense the\ncause of ultimate truth, but only because it is the strict\nexclusion of ultimate truth.\n3.1 The Setup-Punchline Structure of Reality\n\nThis can be compared to the structure of the relation between the set\nup and the punch line of a certain kind of joke. Consider the\nfollowing:\n\n(Setup)\nTwo strangers were chatting on a bus. One told the other he was on\nhis way to a biology lab downtown to pick up his dog. \u201cThe\nscientists there are doing some research on him\u201d, he said.\n\u201cHe was born with no nose\u201d.\n\u201cReally?\u201d said the other. \u201cHow does he\nsmell?\u201d\n(Punchline)\n\u201cAwful\u201d.\n\n\nLet\u2019s talk about that structure. When we hear the question\n\u201cHow does he smell?\u201d it seems as if it is a serious query,\nan expression of serious curiosity about canine anatomy and its\nmutations. It has the quality of seriousness, of factuality, of\nnon-ironic information. There is nothing funny about that statement.\nBut, when the punch line comes, retrospectively, that set up is funny.\nThat set up is funny because it has been recontextualized by the pun\non the word \u201csmell\u201d, which is made to have more than one\nidentity when put into a new context.\n\nThe interesting thing to note here is that it is precisely by\nnot being funny that the setup was funny. In other words, if\nit was already funny, if you didn\u2019t take it seriously for a\nsecond, the contrast between the two different meanings of this thing\ncould never have clashed in the way that is necessary to make the\nlaughter, to make it actually funny. We have a setup which is serious\nand a punch line which is funny, but when you look back at the setup\nfrom the vantage point of having heard the punchline, that setup is\nalso funny. After all, we don\u2019t say that just the punch line is\nfunny. We say the whole joke is funny. The setup is funny in the mode\nof not being funny yet. It is only funny because it wasn\u2019t\nfunny. It is the same thing in the Lotus Sutra and it is the same\nthing in life really. You\u2019re Enlightened! That is what\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism says, everyone is Enlightened! Everybody\nis a Buddha! But the way in which you are a Buddha is the way in which\nthe setup of a joke is funny, i.e., by not being a Buddha. By\nstruggling toward buddhahood, toward something else, but by\nrevisualizing or recontextualizing or expanding awareness, which has\nbeen the preferred technique in Buddhism all along, those very things\nwhich are the details of daily life, of the struggles to interact, to\ndeal with conditions and suffering and lack of control are not just a\nmeans to buddhahood. They are themselves buddhahood as the life of a\nsentient being.\n\nThe \u201cprovisional\u201d, conventional truth, local coherence, is\nthe set-up. The \u201cultimate truth\u201d, Emptiness, global\nincoherence, ontological ambiguity, is the punch line. What is\nimportant here is to preserve both the contrast between the\ntwo and their ultimate identity in sharing the quality of\nhumorousness which belongs to every atom of the joke considered as a\nwhole, once the punch line has been revealed. The setup is serious,\nwhile the punchline is funny. The funniness of the punchline depends\non the seriousness of the setup, and on the contrast and difference\nbetween the two. However, once the punchline has occurred, it is also\nthe case that the setup is, retrospectively, funny. This also means\nthat the original contrast between the two is both preserved and\nannulled: neither funniness nor seriousness means the same thing after\nthe punchline dawns, for their original meanings depended on the\nmutually exclusive nature of their defining contrast. Is the setup\nserious or funny? It is both: it is funny as serious, and\nserious as funny. Is the punchline serious or funny? It is\nboth, but in an interestingly different way. It is obviously funny,\nbut is it also serious? Yes. Why? Because now that the setup has\noccurred, both \u201cfunny\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d have a\ndifferent meaning. Originally, we thought that \u201cfunny\u201d\nmeant \u201cwhat I laugh at when I hear it\u201d or something like\nthat, and \u201cserious\u201d meant \u201cwhat gives me non-funny\ninformation\u201d or something similar. But now we see that\n\u201cfunny\u201d can also mean: What I take to be serious, what I\nam not laughing about, what I am earnestly considering, or\ncrying over, or bewailing even.\n\nBut this means also that \u201cserious\u201d means \u201cwhat can\nturn out to be either funny or serious\u201d. So both\n\u201cfunny\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d now both mean\n\u201cfunny-and-serious, what can appear as both funny and\nserious\u201d. Each is now a center that subsumes of the other; they\nare intersubsumptive. As a consequence, the old pragmatic standard of\ntruth is applied more liberally here: all claims, statements and\npositions are true in the sense that all can, if properly\nrecontextualized, lead to liberation\u2014which is to say, to their\nown self-overcoming. Conversely, none will lead to liberation if not\nproperly contextualized.\n3.2 Tiantai Teachings about Teachings: \u201cImpermanence\u201d as both Opposite and Synonym of \u201cPermanence\u201d (In Four Steps)\n\nThis contextualism is applied intricately and thoroughgoingly to\nBuddhist teachings themselves, including especially its most\nfoundational teachings about the basic character of existence:\nimpermanence, suffering, and non-self\u2014and also about the solutions to\nthose conditions: enlightenment and Buddhahood. Are all things\npermament or impermanent? Are there selves or no selves? Can we end\nsuffering or can\u2019t we? For Tiantai the right question to be\nasked for understanding and applying doctrine is not \u201cis it\ntrue?\u201d\u2014since all doctrines are \u201ctrue\u201d in this\nsense of \u201cliberating\u201d in some contexts, and not in\nothers\u2014but rather \u201cin what sense, and in what context, is it\ntrue, i.e., liberating?\u201d It is in this connection that we must\nunderstand the Tiantai \u201cclassification of teachings.\u201d\nAmong the many rubrics used for this purpose in traditional Tiantai,\nthe most philosophically important is the classification of the four\ntypes of contents of the Buddha\u2019s teaching\n(\u5316\u6cd5\u56db\u6559), called the Four Teachings, namely,\nTripitaka, Shared, Separate, and Perfect\n\u85cf\uff0c\u901a\uff0c\u5225\uff0c\u5713).\n\nThese four types of content are viewed by Tiantai thinkers not as four\ndifferent teachings, but as really increasingly subtle explications of\none and the same content, the basic Buddhist teaching, via more and\nmore expansive recontextualizations. Tiantai classifies all the\nteachings found in the Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist scriptures into\nthese four general types, according to the degree to which they have\ndeveloped the understanding of the basic Buddhist concepts of\nuniversal conditionality, i.e., of Impermanence, Suffering, and\nNon-Self. It should be noted again that all four of these types are\nregarded as \u201ctrue teachings\u201d of the Buddha\u2014true in\nthe sense of validly propounded as a way of liberating sentient beings\nfrom suffering in some particular context\u2014and that all are\nequally also not considered uniquely true\ndescriptions of reality. Moreover, in keeping with the general Tiantai\napproach to interpretation, they are not really different\nteachings at all: they are viewed as alternate expositions of the same\nidea as it is recontextualized, to varying degrees of thoroughness as\nappropriate, even though\u2014as we shall see\u2014they appear\nprima facie to be in direct contradiction to one another. As\nsuch, this schema provides us with a strong general model of the\nTiantai conception of the self-overcoming of suffering, impermanence\nand non-self, wherein they are overcome by remaining exactly as they\nwere, indeed even more so, and thereby are revealed to also be their\nown opposites.\n\nZhiyi takes an obscure passage from a Chinese translation of the\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Mah\u0101parinirv\u0101na\nS\u016btra as one of his models for these four expositions.\n\nLiterally, the passage reads as follows:\n\n \n(Reality) cannot be described in terms of the arising of what\narises.\n \nIt cannot be described in terms of the non-arising of what\narises.\n \nIt cannot be described in terms of the arising of\nnon-arising.\n \nIt cannot be described in terms of the non-arising of\nnon-arising.\n \nIt cannot be described in terms of arising or non-arising [in any\nof these ways].\n \nYet under the right circumstances it can be validly described in\nterms of any of these.\n\n\nThe passage can be somewhat more venturesomely translated as\nfollows:\n\n \nThe generated generates: that cannot be said.\n \nThe generated is ungenerated: that cannot be said.\n \nThe ungenerated generates: that cannot be said.\n \nThe ungenerated ungenerates: that cannot be said.\n \nIt cannot be said that there is either generation or the\nungenerated in any of these ways.\n \nAlthough all four of these cannot be said, yet any of them\ncan be said under the right circumstances [i.e., none is\nliterally or absolutely valid, but all are conventionally\nvalid\u2014i.e., pragmatically effective in leading to\nliberation\u2014in certain situations].\n\n\n \n\u751f\u751f\n\u4e0d\u53ef\u8aaa\uff0c\u751f\u4e0d\u751f\u4ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u8aaa\uff0c\u4e0d\u751f\u751f\u4ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u8aaa\uff0c\u4e0d\u751f\u4e0d\u751f\u4ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u8aaa\uff0c\u751f\u4ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u8aaa\uff0c\u4e0d\u751f\u4ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u8aaa\uff0c\u4ee5\u6709\u56e0\u7de3\u6545\u53ef\u5f97\u8aaa\n\n\nFor Zhiyi this passage gives more than a standard Buddhist negation of\nthe tetralemma followed by its provisional affirmation. Instead, he\nlinks these four positions to the following four general categories,\neach with its own distinct way of understanding the Four Noble Truths,\nand therefore its own way of understanding the nature of all things,\nthe nature of all conditional events, of both the arising and\nperishing of suffering (i.e., of all ordinary experience), of both\nsuffering and liberation from suffering, and of how they are\nrelated:\n\n1. Tripitaka Teaching \u85cf\u6559: \u201cThe Generated\nGenerates\u201d \u751f\u751f, or literally, \u201cThe arising of\nwhat arises.\u201d\n\nThe things described by the Four Noble Truths \u2013 i.e., all\nconditional experience of suffering as well as the experience of the\nUnconditioned which is liberation from suffering\u2014actually arise and\nperish. (shengmie sidi\n\u751f\u6ec5\u56db\u8ae6)\n\nAll things are empty in that they are impermanent, and vanish without\nremainder when analyzed and dissolved into their parts\n(\u201canalytic emptiness\u201d\nxikong\u6790\u7a7a).\n\n2.

(wusheng sidi\n\u7121\u751f\u56db\u8ae6)\n\nAll things are empty in their very nature from the beginning (whether\nliterally impermanent and dissolved into parts or not)\n(\u201cemptiness embodied right in the thing,\u201d tikong\n\u9ad4\u7a7a).\n\n3. Separate Teaching \u5225\u6559: The [Previously Established]\nUngenerated Generates [Infinitely] \u4e0d\u751f\u751f, or\nliterally, \u201cthe arisings of what does not arise\u201d\n\nThe things described by the Four Noble Truths \u2013 i.e., all\nconditional experiences of suffering as well as the experience of the\nUnconditioned which is liberation from suffering\u2014can be validly\ndescribed not only as \u201creally\u201d empty of any determinations\nof their own and thus neither arising nor perishing, but also, because\nthey are also aspects of the compassionate liberative work of a\nbodhisattva, in an infinity of alternate ways. (wuliang\nsidi \u7121\u91cf\u56db\u8ae6)\n\nThe previous characterizations of things as empty or as non-empty were\nboth one-sided, as things are in reality neither empty nor non-empty.\nRather, both Emptiness and all non-empty things are manifestations\n\u201cthe Center,\u201d a tertium quid which is\nbeyond but also includes both the ungenerated aspect and the generated\naspect, at once both form and formless, the constant infinite\nproductions of forms by the formless, formlessness present only as the\ninfinity of forms. It is the collapsing of emptiness and non-emptiness\ninto something that is immediately both: their unity, which is the\nreal source of both: this is the Buddha-nature as \u201cExclusive\nCenter\u201d danzhong foxing\n\u4f46\u4e2d\u4f5b\u6027, hidden beneath the two extremes, the\ninner kernel of all phenomena, as their source and ultimate\nreality.\n\n4. Perfect Teaching \u5713\u6559: The (infinite things generated\nby the) Ungenerated (are also) Ungenerated\n\u4e0d\u751f\u4e0d\u751f, or literally, \u201cthe\nnon-arisings of the non-arising.\u201d\n\nThe things described by the Four Noble Truths \u2013 i.e., all\nconditional experiences of suffering as well as the experience of\nliberation from suffering\u2014in all those infinite alternate forms, are\n[actually, in their very infinite production,] unmade and unbegun (and\nunfinishable). (wuzuo sidi\n\u7121\u4f5c\u56db\u8ae6)\n\nEach thing is empty, non-empty, and the Center. Each thing is neither\nempty, non-empty, nor the Center. Each thing is entirely and only\nempty. Each thing is entirely and only non-empty. Each thing is\nentirely and only the Center. Each thing subsumes all the others. Each\nthing is subsumed by all the others. Each of the previous sentences in\nthis paragraph are synonyms. Not only each thing: the aspect of\nemptiness itself is empty, non-empty, and Center, and considered\npurely on its own terms is not only the negation of all things but\nalso, when fully thought through, the positing of all things\n(non-empty) and the identity of positing and negation (Center). The\nsame is true for the aspect of non-emptiness, and Center: each one\nalone is all three. This is the \u201cNon-Exclusive Center.\u201d\nbudanzhong \u4e0d\u4f46\u4e2d\u4f5b\u6027 Because\nit is what a Buddha lives and realizes, it is also called \u201cthe\nBuddha-nature\u201d. Each thing is the center of the universe, the\nsubstance of which all other things are attributes. Each is the source\ngenerating all things, but also inherently contains all things within\nitself so that it generates nothing, and likewise being generated by,\nand contained by, any other thing. Each thing is readable equally as\nany other thing. Each thing is also the end toward which all other\nthings tend, the telos of all things. A more detailed\nexposition of these four positions, and their relation to each other,\nis given in the following supplementary document:\n\nFour Teachings\n\n3.3 Time and Facts\n\nThe Three Truths, then, are actually three different but mutually\nimplicative ways of looking at any object or state. Each implies the\nother two, and each is one way to describe the whole of that\nobject, including its other two aspects. To be established is to be\nnegated. To be begun is to be constitutively incomplete; to be\ndeterminate is to be ambiguous, to be anything is to be more than that\nthing. If it were not more\u2014other\u2014than X, it would\nnot even be X. We may think about this in terms of the status\nof a \u201cfact\u201d. Emerson says in his essay,\n\u201cHistory\u201d (1841):\n\n\nTime dissipates to shining ether the solid angularity of facts. No\nanchor, no cable, no fences avail to keep a fact a fact.\n\n\nHe meant that every historical fact registers \u201cat a\ndistance\u201d, in other times and places, taking on the role of an\never-ramifying metaphor that applies to more and more individual\ncases, with more and more diverse and rich implications. With a few\nsmall modifications, this brings us close to the Tiantai view: all we\nneed to do is specify that \u201ctime\u201d and \u201cfact\u201d\nare not really two different things, with the former acting to\nambiguate the solidity of the latter, but are in reality two sides of\nthe same thing, two aspects of a single process, in fact are\nultimately synonyms. Time is just the addition of other facts. New\nfacts are just the presence of additional time. In the Tiantai view\nthese new facts are not imposed on the initial fact from without, but\nare posited as the context which alone made it a fact in the first\nplace, made it determinate as just this fact. \u201cTime\u201d just\nmeans the self-positing of both itself and other facts by any fact.\nTime makes facts facts, and unmakes facts by making more facts, all of\nwhich are intrinsic to the first fact: history is the positing and\ntranscending, the self-establishment and self-recontextualization of\nany given fact.\n\nPut another way, let us stipulate that a fact\u2014any determination\nabout what is so\u2014is something that is in principle knowable, and\nthat knowability implies a subject-object relation, and therefore a\n\u201cdistance\u201d or separation, some space away from the\nfact-to-be-known. That means that a fact is only a fact if there is\nsomething outside of it, another fact, another time, a place to view\nit from; it doesn\u2019t count as a fact unless it can impact on some\nother site, unless it relates to some otherness. But that means that\nits journey out beyond itself to otherness is intrinsic to its very\nfacticity, and it is this journey out beyond itself that Emerson\ndenotes with the word \u201ctime\u201d. To be thus and so, a fact\nmust be viewable from elsewhere, and elsewhere, whether in physical or\nin conceptual space, implies the illimitable positing of still other\nalternate perspectives from which to be seen, facts to impact,\nviewpoints to interpret and metaphorically internalize the initial\nfact. Determinacy implies limit, limit implies space, space implies\ninfinity of other spaces, of other perspectives, of other contexts.\nFor something to be a fact is for it to intrinsically posit distances\nfrom itself, and thus to be viewable otherwise.\n\nMost simply, we can say that for Tiantai time itself simply\nis the continual \u201copening of the provisional to reveal\nthe real\u201d: an unceasing process of self-recontexualization where\nthe past on the one hand remains unchangeable and on the other is\nconstantly changing with each recontextualization. A moment of time is\na recontextualization of the all the past. This also implies that the\nTiantai notion of interpervasion of past, present and future, and of\nthe \u201cinherent inclusion\u201d of all entities in each, is very\nfar from resulting in a static picture of the universe devoid of any\ngenuine creativity. For in Tiantai, each moment of time brings with it\nnot only a new set of actual occasions, but a new set of\n\u201ceternal principles\u201d\u2014categorical obligations,\neternal objects, laws, universals. Each moment is effectively the\ncreation of a new God who determines anew the character of the rest of\nthe universe and of all the past and future.\n\nA moment, to be a moment, must be surrounded by other moments, from\nwhich it differs. \u201cNow\u201d must be different from\n\u201cthen\u201d. But that means \u201cnow\u201d must\nrelate to \u201cthen\u201d. The \u201cthen\u201d is part\nof the world of the \u201cnow\u201d, against which it defines\nitself, to which it stands in necessary contrast. This contrast cannot\nbe either internal or external to the \u201cnow\u201d and to the\n\u201cthen\u201d. \u201cNow\u201d is really\n\u201cnow-then\u201d, and \u201cthen\u201d is really\n\u201cthen-now\u201d. This is easy to understand if we consider the\nstate of the entire totality of being at moment M and at\nmoment M+1. The state of things at M is thought to\nhave the power to cause the arising of the state of things at\nM+1. But if M is gone when M+1 arrives, it\ncannot \u201creach\u201d M+1 to do anything to it; it is\nalready gone, non-existent, and thus can do nothing. If the state of\nthings at M continues to exist when M+1 arrives,\nhowever, time has failed to move ahead, or we must admit the\ncoexistence of two alternate total states of being at the same time.\nIf the appearance of M+1 does not necessitate the\ndisappearance of M (which by our hypothesis possesses the\npower to bring about M+1), M would then continue to\ngenerate precisely M+1 repeatedly forever. In either case,\ntime would not be possible, and no real entities could arise. Moments\nof time are neither same nor different; they are present as one\nanother, the past as present as future, the future as past and\npresent, the present as past and future. The past is not yet\nover\u2014every moment of the present and future reveals more about\nthe past and its infinite changes, for they are non-different from it,\nthough allowing it to appear as these new moments. The\npresent never begins\u2014however far back you look, you will always\nbe able to find all the characteristics of the present there,\nunchanged though appearing as some former moment. The present\nnever ends\u2014all future moments are further disclosures about this\npresent moment of experience happening right now.\n3.4 Self-Overcoming of the Whole into Any Upayic Part\n\nWe can say all things are impermanent, as in early Buddhism\u2014but\nnow we know this is just a situationally attachment-undermining way of\nsaying \u201cimpermanent-permanent\u201d. We can say all things are\npermanent\u2014meaning \u201cpermanent-impermanent\u201d. We can\nsay some things are permanent and others are impermanent\u2014meaning\n\u201csome-all are permanent-impermanent\u201d and \u201call-some\nare impermanent-permanent\u201d. But note too that this does not mean\n\u201cpermanent-impermanent\u201d is the real truth, while\n\u201cpermanent\u201d and \u201cimpermanent\u201d are both\none-sided distortions. That would be what Tiantai critiques as the\n\u201cexclusive Center\u201d. Rather, just as\n\u201cpermanent\u201d really means\n\u201cimpermanent-permanent\u201d,\n\u201cimpermanent-permanent\u201d really means\n\u201cpermanent\u201d, or really means\n\u201cimpermanent\u201d. For impermanent-permanent appears\nas permanence and as impermanence, and each of these\nis the entirety, not a mere part, of the whole. To be permanent is\nalready to also be impermanent\u2014there is no other permanence. To\nbe impermanent is already to also be permanent\u2014there is no other\nimpermanence. All is funny, all is serious, all is funny-serious. Each\nis a perfectly equal synonym for all three. Each is an equally\nadequate-inadequate description of the truth.\n\nThe same applies in all other cases. We can say all is\nsuffering\u2014meaning \u201csuffering-bliss\u201d. We can say all\nis bliss\u2014meaning \u201cbliss-suffering\u201d. We can say all\nis mind\u2014meaning \u201cmind-matter\u201d. We can say all is\nmatter\u2014meaning \u201cmatter-mind\u201d. We can say there is a\nGod\u2014meaning \u201cGod-Godless\u201d. We can say there is no\nGod\u2014meaning \u201cGodless-God\u201d. We can say all is\nillusion\u2014meaning \u201cillusion-reality\u201d. We can say all\nis reality\u2014meaning \u201creality-illusion\u201d. We can say\nsome things are true and some things are false\u2014meaning\n\u201csome-all is true-false and all-some is false-true\u201d. We\ncan say there is historical progress\u2014meaning\n\u201cprogress-stagnation\u201d. We can say there is historical\nstagnation\u2014meaning \u201cstagnation-progress\u201d. We can say\nsociety is evil\u2014meaning \u201cevil-good\u201d. We can say\nsociety is good\u2014meaning \u201cgood-evil\u201d. We can say we\nare sometimes happy and sometimes sad\u2014meaning \u201cwe-everyone\nare sometimes-always happy-sad and sometimes-always sad-happy\u201d.\nAnd so on. How should we choose which will we say at any time? If all\nthings are sayable in some sense, what should we say right now? We\nshould say whatever is most conducive to liberation from suffering,\nfrom one-sided attachments, in this particular situation and\ncontext.\n4. The Ultimate Reality of All Appearances (\u8af8\u6cd5\u5be6\u76f8 zhufashixiang)\n\nThe same method underlies all of Tiantai\u2019s shocking slogans,\nsuch as the claim that \u201call moments are permanent\u201d, as we\nhave seen, or \u201call appearances are the ultimate reality\u201d,\nor \u201cevil is ineradicable from the highest good,\nBuddhahood\u201d. They mean what they say, of course: no moment ever\nends, and however anything appears to anyone for however long is the\nultimate reality that all things emerge from, all things return to,\nthat explains and supports and sustains all things. True enough. The\nopposite would also be true. But these particular claims are\nemphasized in classical Tiantai writings to offset the more common\none-sided prejudices that tend the other way. Because the impermanence\nof things and the illusoriness of appearances is stressed in the rest\nof Buddhism, it is assumed that anyone getting to Tiantai will already\nbe aware of this side of reality, and indeed may be in danger of\nclinging to it. So Tiantai asserts the opposite, which is equally\ntrue.\n\nAll appearances are the ultimate reality: how is that true? Normally,\nwe believe that in some kind of appearance versus reality contrast:\n\u201cI thought that was a snake, but upon closer inspection it\nturned out to be a rope\u201d. This is what most of Buddhism also\nsays: \u201cI thought there was a self, but it turned out to be a\nbunch of impermanent aggregates\u201d. Or, \u201cI thought there was\na world, but it turned out to be all mind, or Buddha-nature, or\nillusion\u201d. Common sense assumes this too: the rim of my glass\nlooks oval, but in fact we know that, \u201creally\u201d, it is\nround\u2014it\u2019s just that we\u2019re seeing it from an angle\nthat foreshortens it. The rainbow is a mere appearance\u2014when we\ngo to touch it, we find nothing there. But the clouds and sunlight are\nreal, they are what it really is, what it turns out to really be.\nTiantai, however, makes the preposterous claim that the oval and the\ncircle are both true\u2014in fact, both are the ultimate reality, are\nfindable in all things and at all times and places, are the Absolute.\nThe rainbow and the cloudy sunlight\u2014both true, both absolutely\ntrue, both the Absolute. The \u201cself\u201d and the impermanent\naggregates\u2014both true, both absolutely true, both the Absolute.\nThe snake and the rope\u2014both true, both absolutely true, both the\nAbsolute. All is illusion. All is reality. Time is not an illusion.\nTime is the illusoriness of every possible thing. Time is a word that\nmeans \u201cwhatever you think is so is already not so\u201d. What\nis real? What you can go back to, look at again, check up on, verify,\nre-examine. But there is literally no experience that you can\ngo back to, so there is none that is real. What is illusion? Something\nthat turns out to be otherwise than it appears. There is no thing of\nwhich this is not the case. The horn \u201cappeared\u201d to be\nround, but \u201cturned out\u201d to be \u201csharp\u201d. But\nboth roundness and sharpness are equally unreal, equally real. Each is\ndetermined by the context in which it is seen. Taking the unnameable\nwhole into account, they too are unnameable, neither sharp nor round.\nRoundness and sharpness are two names for the same thing, which is\nround, sharp, and neither round nor sharp, and both round and\nsharp.\n4.1 Inherent Evil Ineradicable In Buddhahood and the Buddha-nature of Insentient Beings\n\nThe same goes for the famous Tiantai claim that \u201cevil is\ninherently included in Buddhahod\u201d. Future Buddhahood lives in\npast delusion, so delusion is \u201cBuddhahood-delusion\u201d. Past\ndelusion lives in future Buddhahood, so Buddhahood is\n\u201cdelusion-Buddhahood\u201d. The same goes also for the famous\nTiantai claim that \u201cinsentient beings have the\nBuddha-nature\u201d\u2014i.e., that rocks and stones and all other\nthings with no awareness have the all-pervasive unconditional nature\nof awareness: awareness is always nonawareness-awareness (all\nawareness exists-with nonawareness, e.g., the objects of awareness,\nwhich are not themselves aware), nonawareness is always\nawareness-nonawareness (i.e., nonawareness is determinately\nnonawareness only as contrasted by awareness to awareness itself, and\nis intrinsically inseparable from whatever awareness might exist in\nthe universe, simply by virtue of the inseparability of all\nexistence).\n\nThe controversial idea of \u201cthe Buddha-nature of insentient\nbeings\u201d is developed by Zhanran in his Jingangpi using\na slightly different approach to the Three Truths, focusing on the\ntrope of space as advanced as a metaphor for Buddha-nature in\nthe Mah\u0101y\u0101na Nirvana Sutra, in its character of\nall-pervasiveness, ineradicability, and indivisibility, and the\nnon-different/non-identical relation of all regions of space to each\nother and of each region of space to whatever possible object can\noccupy it. But here too the central argument is the inseparable\nintersubsumption of the two opposite terms: sentience is always\ninsentience-sentience, insentience is always\nsentience-insentience.\n\nOne way to think about this is to consider a magnet. It has a north\nand a south \u201cpole\u201d to it. If we wanted to separate the\nnorth from the south pole, we might try cutting it in half. But when\nwe do so, we find that each half still has both a north and a\nsouth pole. No matter how many times we slice it, the total set of\ndifferent characteristics pertaining to the whole are also found in\nthat separate part: northness and southness are, in their entirety,\nfound in what was formerly, in the context of the whole magnet, purely\nthe north part, and also in the former south part. This is how it is\nin the Tiantai universe: the universe is one big magnet, but instead\nof just a north and a south, it has 3000 different characteristic\naspects: meness, youness, trains, oceans, dogs, soups, historical\nincidents, smiles, tears, delusion, enlightenment. If we try to\nisolate any of these, however, what we end up with is another entire\n\u201cmagnet\u201d, which also has all 3000 aspects to it: this\nmeness, it turns out, also has its youness part, its train part, its\nocean part, its dog part, and so on. When I face you, it is you-and-me\nfacing you-and-me. It is me-and-all-worlds facing all-worlds-and-me.\nIt is the entire universe facing the entire universe. We are always\ndifferent, because wherever we go, there is a you and a me, two\ndifferent aspects, never merging into a blank indifferent mush of a\nsingle quality. But since me-and-you is contrasted to me-and-you,\nthere is really no contrast at all: the same thing is found on both\nsides of the contrast. We are neither the same nor different. We are\ndivided from ourselves, impossible to unify into a simple unity, but\nfor that very reason we are impossible to separate from one\nanother. Each of us, at each moment, are, in a word, absolute, the\nCenter as which all appears, and which is appearing in and as all\nthings. All things are our transformation bodies, we are the\ntransformation body of all things.\n4.2 Buddhahood as Full Realization of Dung Beetlehood et alia\n\nThis also means that, the more fully one realizes that one is any\nparticular being, the more one realizes that he or she is also all\nother, contrasted, things as well. This is how traditional Buddhist\n\u201cnon-self\u201d doctrine comes to play out in Tiantai. I think\nI am already this self, Brook, but in reality, Buddhism tells me, I am\nnot yet really any such self\u2014for to be a self is to be\nunconditional, and that is impossible for \u201cme\u201d, a\nconditional determinate being. Also, I am not yet\nenlightened\u2014for enlightenment is unconditionality, the only\nfreedom from suffering. To become unconditioned, as I\u2019d thought\nI was when I thought I was a self, is to become enlightened. This\nnon-self is the only thing that really fulfills my previous lust to be\na self, to actually be me. I cannot become this by being me\nas a determinate being to the exclusion of all other beings, nor other\nbeings to the exclusion of me. Rather, by the Three Truths, I can only\nbecome more and more me by becoming more and more everything else, and\nthat is what it means to become more and more enlightened, and to\nbecome more me, more unconditionally this specific me. To\n\u201cbecome what I am\u201d, to be a more fully realized version of\nmyself, is to see myself, Brook specifically, as unconditional, which\nmeans as omnipresent and eternal, which means as expressing itself in\nand as all things, which also means, conversely, intersubsumed, i.e.,\nas an expression of all other things, as something as which\nall other things are appearing. I cannot be myself until I am a\nBuddha, but I cannot be a Buddha until I can be more fully (i.e., more\nunconditionally, more all-pervasively) myself, and that means being\nmore fully a devil, a fool, a table, a spaceship, or, in Siming\nZhili\u2019s example, a dung beetle. Buddhist practice is the\nprogressively fuller manifestation of my latent Buddhahood\u2014which\nmeans also the progressively fuller manifestation of my latent\nDung-Beetlehood, and indeed, my allegedly long ago already actual but\nreally hitherto merely latent Brookhood.\n5. Practice and Doctrinal Diversity\n\nTiantai is encyclopedic in its approach to Buddhist practice; as one\nmight expect in light of its view of \u201cexclusion\u201d in\ngeneral, it excludes nothing. Hence in Tiantai works we find\nextensive, detailed cataloging of a huge diversity of traditional\nBuddhist practices, from rituals and devotions to meditations and\ncontemplations of all kinds, derived from all strata of previous\nBuddhist culture. This accords not only with the philosophical\nobjection to the possibility of any final mutual exclusion of entities\nrehearsed above, but also to the Lotus Sutra notion of\nup\u0101ya, and the expansion of the range of Conventional\nTruth in the Three Truths: the diversity of sentient beings is\nlimitless, their specific delusions and attachments and sufferings are\nof limitless specific types, and thus the appropriate remedial\npractices and doctrines for them are limitless. This is also the\njustification for the \u201ctrivialist\u201d position that all\npossible claims are true, for \u201ctrue\u201d in the Tiantai\ncontext meansonly a remedial up\u0101ya serving as a raft to\novercome itself, but doing so by totalization of itself, thereby\nundermining itself, expressing itself in and as all other things,\nintersubsuming all other truth-claims, thereby become all the more\npresent as all the more absent.\n5.1 Self-Overcoming of Doctrinal Hierarchy into Omniultimacy\n\nTiantai takes the non-dualistic ideas suggested by the Lotus\nSutra in fables and unexplained narrative hints, and adapts the\nresources of Emptiness and the Two Truths to give them a full\nphilosophical explanation and practical application for Buddhist\npractice. The Lotus Sutra had made up\u0101ya the\ncenterpiece of Buddhism, and asserted a unity of all practices in the\nOne Vehicle, all leading toward Buddhahood. Tiantai follows this lead\nand constructs a vast and complex system for accounting for and\nintegrating all known forms of Buddhist and even non-Buddhist\npractice, all of which are acceptable skillful means appropriate and\nwholesome for different persons and times. It rejects nothing, but it\norganizes all known teachings and practices into an interconnected\nsystem. The system has an interesting double structure: the first time\nthrough, it appears to be hierarchical, putting the Mah\u0101y\u0101na\nabove the Hinayana and the Lotus above the rest of the\nMah\u0101y\u0101na. But the idea of redefinition of identity through\nrecontextualization is applied here, and when the hierarchical crown\nof the Lotus has done its work, it has the retroactive effect\nof making all the other parts equal as aspects of the One Vehicle.\nThat is, no teaching, practice or behavior has only a single meaning:\nits meaning is determined by the context in which it is viewed. So any\ngiven doctrine or practice can be seen as both the ultimate truth and\nas a more partial and only locally relevant, or lesser, truth. The\nTiantai system of integrating all the various teachings and ideas and\nperspectives in the world provides a system for seeing everything\ntwice, three times, infinite times, reassessing and developing the\nmeanings of each item as it comes into broader and broader relations.\nThe Hinayana teaching is, in the narrower context, a\n\u201clesser\u201d truth. But in the context of the One Vehicle, it\nis itself an instantiation of the One Vehicle, and even gives unique\nexpression to it: hence the claim (based on a clever strong misreading\nof a line from Kum\u0101raj\u012bva\u2019s translation of the\nLotus: \u6c7a\u4e86\u8072\u805e\u6cd5\n\u70ba\u8af8\u7d93\u4e4b\u738b) that the Hinayana doctrine\n(rather than the Lotus itself) is itself the Highest of All\nTeachings. The same goes for all other particular ideas, beliefs,\npractices. Since nothing has only one meaning, everything can\nmean anything. The interesting question about any proposition is not\nwhether it is true (it always is), but how. The\nTiantai \u201cclassification of teachings\u201d is an intricate and\ncomplex way of spelling out in what context and in what way each\ndoctrine means each of the many things it means.\n5.2 The Contemplation of Mind as the Three Thousand (\u89c0\u5fc3 guanxin, \u4e00\u5ff5\u4e09\u5343 yiniansanqian)\n\nThe way in which each and any of these alternate methods or doctrines\nis recontextualized to promote the desired Tiantai implication is\nthrough the supplementation of the Three Truths view of any and every\npossible content. Tiantai meditation most centrally applies a method\ncalled \u201cthe contemplation of mind\u201d, (\u89c0\u5fc3\nguanxin) given its most famous formulation in Zhiyi\u2019s\nunfolding of \u4e00\u5ff5\u4e09\u5343 yiniansanqian\n(Japanese: ichinensanzen), which means something like: \u201cOne\nMoment of Experience as Three Thousand Worlds\u201d. The \u201cthree\nthousand\u201d is of course a way of saying \u201ceverything\u201d,\nbut it is really something a bit more than that. For of course, as\nZhiyi himself points out, any number would be an equally accurate\npossible way to talk about the totality of all things, from none to\ninfinity. This number, \u201cthree thousand\u201d, is concocted\nspecifically with meditational practice in mind. Here\u2019s how\nit\u2019s derived:\n\n\n\nTen Realms \u00d7\nTen Realms \u00d7\nTen Suchnesses \u00d7\nThree Worlds=3000 \n\nBuddhahood\nBuddhahood\nAppearance\nFive Aggregates \n\nBodhisattva\nBodhisattva\nNature\n \n\nPratyekabuddha[1]\nPratyekabuddha\nComponents\n \n\nSravaka[2]\nSravaka\nCapability\n \n\nGods\nGods\nAction\nSentient Beings \n\nHumans\nHumans\nCauses\n \n\nAsuras[3]\nAsuras\nConditions\n \n\nAnimals\nAnimals\nEffects\n \n\nHungry Ghosts\nHungry Ghosts\nConsequences\nEnvironment\n \n\nPurgatories\nPurgatories\nUltimate Equality and Equal Ultimacy\n  \n\n\nPlease note a few peculiarities of this way of listing \u201cwhat\nexists\u201d. First, special care is taken here to include both\n\u201cpurgatories\u201d (i.e., the demonic thoughts,\npractices and consequences of extreme subjective delusion and\nsuffering) on the one hand, and \u201cBuddhas\u201d, (the\nenlightened thoughts, practices and consequences of the greatest\nwisdom and liberation) on the other hand. This is important, because\nit cautions us against viewing these subjective states, good or evil,\nas mere epiphenenomena that are somehow outside the ultimate reality.\nThey are themselves included in the ultimate reality. By including\nthese terms, Tiantai guards against a vague notion of\n\u201ceverything\u201d which might lend itself to thinking that only\na pure or neutral substance\u2014mind, matter, energy\u2014is what\nis real, or that the values and perspectives, good and bad, painful\nand pleasant, that living beings experience are not part of the\n\u201ceverything\u201d. The \u201ceverything\u201d that is\nincluded in each moment of experience, and which is eternally\nineradicable, includes all those good and bad subjective states as\nwell.\n\nSecond, we have two important reduplications. The ten realms are all\nthe states in which a sentient being might find him or herself in the\nBuddhist universe, from the lowest ignorance and suffering to the\nhighest bliss and enlightenment. They are often interpreted\nsymbolically: Buddhahood representing a moment of enlightened\nexperience, Bodhisattvahood a moment of compassion, Sravakahood a\nmoment of quiescence or renunciation of the worldly, Godhood a moment\nof great worldly bliss and power, Asurahood a moment of egoistic rage\nand combativeness, animals ignorance, purgatories suffering. One\nreason to read these as states that any being might undergo is that\neach of the ten realms is listed twice. This is because each realm\n\u201cincludes\u201d or \u201cinstantiates\u201d all the other ten\nrealms. That is, each can appear \u201cas\u201d any of the others,\nand in fact nothing appears which is not always \u201cas\u201d\nsomething else. A human-bodhisattva, an animal-god, a Buddha-demon, an\nAsura-Sravaka, etc. A bodhisattva appears as a human, or an animal, or\na Buddha, or an Asura. But as we\u2019ve seen, this also means a\nhuman appears as a bodhisattva, or a demon as an animal, or a Sravaka\nas a hungry ghost, etc. Of course this goes on ad infinitum:\neach of these included realms further includes all ten realms, and so\non. The 10 times 10 is just to point to this factor of mutual\ninclusion, and make sure it is accounted for in our meditative\ncontemplation of \u201cwhat exists\u201d.\n\nThe other duplication comes in the \u201cThree Worlds\u201d. We have\n\u201cthe five aggregates\u201d but also \u201csentient\nbeings\u201d. Actually, these are two ways of looking at the same\nthing. Early Buddhism taught that what we call a sentient\nbeing\u2014you, me, Bill, Dave\u2014is actually a set of five\naggregates, momentarily arising and perishing impersonal processes of\nform, sensation, perception, volition and consciousness. One (the\naggregates) was real, the other (the alleged \u201cself\u201d) was a\npernicious illusion. The Three Thousand includes both. In other words,\nit does not exclude the illusions about things among the totality of\n\u201cwhat exists\u201d\u2014as we\u2019ve seen, all things are\nequally illusions and equally true. The view of you as Bill is one\nitem in the list; the view of you as five impersonal aggregate\nprocesses is another item on the list. Here too we have a shorthand\nway of pointing to a larger principle, and a goad to keep it in mind\nin our contemplation of \u201call that exists\u201d. We are not to\nthink of a set of real entities lined up side by side, mutually\nexclusive, of which there may be some additional erroneous views.\nRather, the erroneous view are part of all that exists, indeed all\nthat exists is some erroneous (i.e., one-sided, locally coherent)\nview. There is no \u201cthing\u201d as such: a thing is just a way\nof appearing, and comes with a viewpoint upon it. Tiantai insists\nfurther that to have a single viewpoint requires at least one\nadditional viewpoint, and so ad infinitum. Normally we drain\noff the ambiguity and call it \u201csubjectivity\u201d or\n\u201cfree will\u201d or \u201cthe unknown future\u201d to one\nside and leave the \u201creality\u201d on the other side, calling it\n\u201cobjectivity\u201d or \u201cdeterminate fact\u201d or\n\u201cthe settled past\u201d. In Tiantai, these are inseparable,\nmerely aspects artificially separated off from the whole, which is\nalways both fixed and open, locally coherent and globally\nincoherent.\n\nThe locus classicus of the above enumeration is Zhiyi\u2019s\ndefinitive work on meditation, Mohezhiguan\n(\u6469\u8a36\u6b62\u89c0), where it is presented as a\ndescription of \u201cthe realm of what is conceivable.\u201d The\ntext walks us through all possible objects of experience this way, one\nby one, almost in the manner of a list out of Walt Whitman\u2019s\nLeaves of Grass, while also adducing these multiperspectival\nreduplications that result from their mutual subsumptions, a\nconsequence of the ontological ambiguity attributed to all entities on\nthe theoretical level by Zhiyi\u2019s doctrine of the Three Truths.\nHis reason for presenting the exposition in this manner, he tells us,\nis because the real topic of interest here, which he calls \u201cthe\nrealm of the Inconceivable,\u201d the proposed object of the central\nTiantai contemplation, is difficult to present directly in theoretical\nterms: it can be disclosed only through first describing the\ncontrasting realm of the \u201cconceivable\u201d as a foil. Once\nthis enumeration of what is conceivable is completed, the actual\nreferent of the term \u201cthe realm of the Inconceivable\u201d is\nat last presented. It turns out to be any single instant of\nexperience, fleetingly arising through the conditional conjunction of\ncognitive organ and cognitive object\u2014that is, what every\nsentient being is experiencing at every moment. Why does Zhiyi\nsuddenly direct us to consider a momentary mental event, an instant of\nexperience that arises and perishes in the blink of an eye, at this\nparticular juncture? The neither-same-nor-different ontological\nambiguity of the Three Truths applies to this entity as well, but now\nthe task is to realize this in meditational practice rather than only\nin theory. To describe what this involves, Zhiyi then asserts, rather\nabruptly, that if there is the arising of the slightest wisp of any\nexperience at all, all the above enumerated Three Thousand are at once\nboth inherently entailed in it \u5177 and also, as he goes on to\nexplain, strictly identical to it \u5373\u2014a way of saying\n\u201care neither the same nor different from it\u201d\n(\u82e5\u7121\u5fc3\u800c\u5df1\uff0c\u4ecb\u723e\u6709\u5fc3\uff0c\u5373\u5177\u4e09\u5343).\nFor an English translation of the passage in question, see Swanson\n2018, Volume 2, pp. 795\u2014836, especially pp. 815\u20136.\n\nTo see what this means and how it is to be actually experienced\nrequires careful unpacking. Tiantai meditation practice represents a\nsurprising and innovative repurposing of certain earlier Buddhist\nmotifs, just as the Tiantai doctrinal positions do. In this case, the\nkey motif to be repurposed is the pan-Buddhist emphasis on the\nimpermanence of mental states. Here this view is pushed to the\nextreme, also found in many earlier schools, of regarding apparent all\nmental continuity as a misperception of what is really a succession of\nradically distinct and extremely brief moments of mental activity. The\ntraditional Buddhist emphasis on the sole reality of the present\ninstant of experience is also radicalized in this move and, in a\ntypical Tiantai manner that by now should seem familiar, both of these\nfamiliar Buddhist claims are thereby repurposed and even reversed, as\nwe shall see.\n\nThe procedure boils down to fomenting a direct phenomenological\nexperience of the meaning of \u201cneither same nor different\u201d\nwith respect to any fleeting moment of experience. The great Song\ndynasty Tiantai thinker Siming Zhili puts it well, summarizing the\nmechanism of the Tiantai \u201ccontemplation of mind\u201d procedure\nwhile also dispelling the idealist misunderstanding that takes it to\nimply a special ontological status for mind as opposed to matter:\n\u201cWe must understand that it is because all [the many elements of\nexperience] share the same nature that they can together dwell in one\nsingle instant of experience. Their dwelling together as one single\ninstant of experience is used to reveal this shared nature. This does\nnot mean we are pointing to the moment of experience [i.e., mental\nactivity, as opposed to material things] itself as their true\nnature.\u201d\n(\u9808\u77e5\u540c\u4e00\u6027\u6545\u3002\u65b9\u80fd\u540c\u5c45\u4e00\u5ff5\u6545\u3002\n\u4ee5\u540c\u5c45\u4e00\u5ff5\u7528\u986f\u540c\u4e00\u771f\u6027\u3002\u975e\u8b02\u4fbf\u5c07\u4e00\u5ff5\u540d\u70ba\u771f\u6027.\n\u2014 \u77e5\u79ae\uff0c\u300c\u5341\u4e0d\u4e8c\u9580\u6307\u8981\u9214\u300d\uff0c\u5377\u4e00) The\n\u201cshared nature\u201d of all phenomena referred to here,\nrevealed by their dwelling together in a single instant, is not the\nnature of mind, or impermanence, or momentariness: it is the Three\nTruths, Emptiness qua Provisional Positing qua Centrality, local\ncoherence qua global incoherence qua intersubsumption, which amounts\nto the apprehension of all elements of experience as \u201cneither\nsame nor different.\u201d Here we are to directly observe what\n\u201cneither same nor different,\u201d which is the nature of all\nphenomena, means as manifest in every single moment of experience, for\nit is their ability to \u201cdwell together\u201d in (or as) a\nsingle moment that reveals this nature.\n\nTo accomplish this, according to the account given in Tiantai texts,\nwe must first apprehend the instant of experience itself as a\nsingle whole. That means to see all the elements of this\nmoment\u2019s experience as mental experience, but\nspecifically as a single mental experience, in which all\nthese elements are simultaneously present, related to one another in a\nspecific instantaneous structure. This requires some training in\nattentiveness to all elements of a single moment equally; the normally\nneglected aspects of a single moment\u2019s experience, its\nperipheral or indistinct elements, are laid out in the above\nenumeration of every possible state one can think of, as a way of\ntrying to reach into every nook and cranny of what one means by\n\u201ceverything that I can think of right now.\u201d This includes\nboth the knower and the known, as well as whatever way the division\nbetween them presents itself. For although the knower is not present\nin the same way other objects of experience are, its presence is felt\nin some form; whatever is apprehensible as the presence of the agent\nof this mentation, the activity that separates itself off from the\nobjective contents, the knower as opposed to the known, as well as the\nact of opposition itself, is also to be included as an aspect or part\nof the world as I know it and imagine it. Also to be included is the\nimagined as well as the perceived, the possible as well as the actual.\nAlso included must be the moment\u2019s sense of its own\ntransitoriness, the sense of being situated between a gone past and\nyet to come future, however these may manifest in the experience. All\nelements perceived or conceived are to be taken in and noted. The next\nstep will be to apprehend these all as felt aspects of a single mental\nevent, a single entity with all these many characteristics in their\nspecific relations of this moment appearing at once, and all\ndisappearing at once, such that not one can be changed or replaced. It\nmust be experienced as a specific total structure of just these\nelements, in just these relations, and none other.\n\nThis endeavor to see the total manifold of contents as a single mental\nevent is meant as a direct way of dispelling the premises of ordinary\n\u201cdeluded\u201d experience. For our ordinary experience is, we\nmay say, premised on a mistaken application of categories derived from\na conception of durational mental and physical objects to fleeting\nexperienced moments themselves, the latter being on this view the real\ncontents of all experience. To be more precise, it must be noted that\ncategories such as \u201csame\u201d and \u201cdifferent,\u201d and\n\u201cwhole\u201d and \u201cpart,\u201d and\n\u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201ccontingent,\u201d and\n\u201cactual\u201d and \u201cpossible,\u201d and \u201cessential\nproperties\u201d and \u201caccidental properties,\u201d actually\napply only to durational objects, whether physical or mental. All of\nthese categories require the comparison of one entity with another,\nwhich cannot be done in the span of an instantaneous upsurge of\nundivided experience.\n\nHow so? Let us start with the most comprehensive of these categories,\nas applied to these single whole moments: are these moments \u201cthe\nsame as\u201d or \u201cdifferent from\u201d one another? Considered\npurely as moments, the answer is \u201cneither.\u201d For it must be\nnoted that the conception of a series of moments laid out in a neutral\ntimeline, seen as a set of derivative entities called moments which\nare somehow laid out in a more basic element (\u201ctime,\u201d\nperhaps, or \u201cnature\u201d) which is not itself a moment, is no\nlonger possible here. If there is no other substratum in which\nanything can exist besides moments of experience, this applies to the\napprehension of \u201cother\u201d moments as well: these\napprehensions of other moments can only exist in some moment. So we\nnow must slightly amend the above claim about the basic constituents,\nand say instead that the most basic elements are not moments, plural,\nas if these were an array of genuinely distinct entities that could\nsomehow be viewed from outside, but simply speak of \u201cthis one\nmoment.\u201d Their plurality exists only from within some specific\nsingle moment. This is why moments cannot be said to simply\n\u201cdifferent\u201d from one another. Yet this impermanent moment\nis not the same as anything else either; it is of the essence of being\na present moment qua moment to be non-identical to other moments,\ni.e., to not-be the past and future moments, and it is the essence of\nexperiencable contents to require contrast to what they are not.\nIndeed, for me to experience the moment as presently occurring at all,\nI must also be experiencing the difference between present\nand not-present in the present; the pastness and futureness\nto which it has to be contrasted to have the quality of being present\nmust in some manner also be present to me. So because we have no\ndurational things, we are radicalizing impermanence, the absolute\ntransitoriness of moments, which points to an absolute difference\nbetween them; but because moments are not like mutually exclusive\nobjects laid side by side in a neutral medium, we have no plurality of\nmoments; their alleged difference is really only each moment\nreappearing in a new form as a component in all other moments, which\nmight be described as each moment\u2019s unceasing transforming\ncontinuance, its radical permanence. Moments are neither the same nor\ndifferent from one another, and thus neither impermanent nor\npermanent, or if we prefer, both impermanent and permanent. It is this\nparadoxical nature of every possible moment of experience that is the\n\u201cthe inconceivable\u201d to be directly realized in Tiantai\ncontemplation.\n\nWhat about the multifarious contents within any one of these\nneither-same-nor-different moments then, the long list of very diverse\nexperienced components of any given moment? These too are\nneither-same-nor-different from one another, within that very moment.\nWe have seen that these single moments of experience are to be viewed\nas indivisible wholes, and that they have no external limits dividing\nthem from other moments that can be observed in a neutral substratum,\nfrom outside the moments themselves. It should be noted that neither\ncan such limits between moments be observed from within any moment,\nfor whatever is observed in a moment is ipso facto within its limits.\nBut what is more surprising is that there are no definite limits even\nbetween the various contents that constitute these moments. They have\nwhat might initially be described as diverse manifold\ncontents\u2014first, the multiple objects of sensory observation that\nare included (chairs and tables, sky and earth, cups and plates,\npeople and trees), but, observing more closely, also\n\u201csubject\u201d and \u201cobject,\u201d \u201cactual\u201d\nand \u201cpossible,\u201d as well as \u201ccenter and periphery,\n(possible) hope and (actual) fear, (possible) pleasure and (actual)\npain, water and mountain\u201d and so on. But properly speaking,\nthese elements are only genuinely \u201cdiverse\u201d if they are\nviewed through the categorial obligations that apply to durational\nobjects, whether physical or mental. These durational things, however,\nare now to be understood as abstract derivatives of moments of\nexperience, rather than the ultimate constituents of reality of which\nmoments of experience are partial apprehensions, as we usually tend to\nbelieve. When viewed on their own terms as moments, the manifold\ncontents are indivisibly present as the moment they constitute, not\nlosing their specific experiential qualities, but not separable into\ndistinct elements that are merely limited \u201cparts\u201d or even\n\u201caspects\u201d of the momentary experience. For we are able to\nidentify distinct \u201cparts\u201d or \u201caspects\u201d in an\nexperienced object only if those parts or aspects can be experienced\nas \u201cthe same\u201d object apart from the whole in which they\nappear, either as isolated entities or as parts or aspects of other\nwholes. This cannot happen with any putative part or aspect of a given\nmoment, for any subsequent appearance of the part or aspect in\nquestion would have to be compared with the part or aspect as it\nappeared in the original moment; but this can only happen in yet\nanother moment, of which both of these instances would in fact be\nparts or aspects. Both moment 1 and moment 2 are now experienced only\nas parts or aspects of moment 3, and the constituent parts or aspects\nof moments 1 and 2 are thus actually component parts or aspects of\nmoment 3. If \u201cpart A\u201d of 1 appears unchanged as\n\u201cpart A\u201d also in moment 2, this tells us only about two\naspects of the indivisible totality of moment 3, nothing about the\nrelation of part A to other parts of moments 1 and 2. For again, there\nis no neutral medium of comparison between two moments.\n\nTo see what is at stake here, we must further consider the derivation\nand entailments of our notion of \u201cdifferent parts or aspects of\na thing\u201d in ordinary consciousness. As I lift my coffee mug to\ntake a sip, my normal consciousness will be tracking certain\ncontinuities, shaped usually by my practical intentions and more\noccasionally by more abstract theoretical considerations. I may see\nthis mug as one in a series of drinking vessels experienced in the\npast; I may think of it as an instance of the general category\n\u201cdrinking vessel.\u201d I may evaluate its effectiveness in\ncontaining the amount of coffee I want to have in one sitting and how\nsmoothly it facilitates delivery of that coffee to my mouth, linking\nit to past and prospective actions and experiences. I may simply think\nof it as a single physical object, an individual substance unifying a\nmanifold of properties such as solidity, color, smoothness, shape. In\neach of these cases, I am making sense of this experienced perception\nof the mug by forefronting its connection with certain other\nperceptions and conceptions, together with which it seems to belong:\nother mugs, the universal concept of drinking vessel, the intention to\ndrink coffee in a few minutes, the properties of solidity and the like\nthat also instantiate in other objects. I will want to distinguish\nbetween which of these connections are necessary and which merely\ncontingent, and my sense-making will be largely dependent on how and\nhow well I do this. If I shift into Tiantai meditation mode, however,\nI am to direct my attention instead to the connection of this\nperception of the mug with everything else going on within this\nmoment of experience. This may include any or all of the above,\nbut viewed as aspects of this moment, alongside everything\nelse in its perceived spatial and temporal surroundings. Viewing that\nmoment as a single indivisible event, I will no longer be able to make\na distinction between necessary and contingent: the moment as a whole\nand every one of its elements are exactly what they are, and cannot be\nany different\u2014for any difference would by definition simply be\nanother moment of experience. To imagine it with any part removed,\nadded or repositioned is simply to be having another moment of\nexperience, not this one. It cannot be compared to another moment to\nsee which parts are permanent and which transitory, which are\nnecessary and essential to its being what it is and which are merely\nadventitious or contingent, for any such comparison would again be the\noccurrence of a different moment. All of it is transitory and every\nconnection equally contingent, but all of it is equally necessarily\njust as it is, none of it can be otherwise than it is. It will\ndefinitely be internally articulated, with what would normally be\ndescribed as portions that are qualitatively distinct from one\nanother, since experienced contrast is necessary to any and all\nperception of qualities, or of any moment occurring at all. But none\nof these elements can be regarded as actually divided into genuinely\n\u201cdifferent portions\u201d of the moment, since none can be\nexperienced without at the same instant experiencing all the\nothers\u2014any act of zeroing in on and \u201cvisiting\u201d one\nwill simply be an additional moment of experience, one that appears as\nan entirely different moment (though of course in the end it too is to\nbe seen as neither-same-nor-different, as already noted); to be\nvisiting one portion is to visit them all.\n\nThis has interesting consequences that pertain also to the devotional\nand ritual aspects of Tiantai practice. Let\u2019s imagine that I am\nthinking about, say, a Buddha; my one instant of experience includes\nan apprehension of both the poor suffering being I am now, along with\nwhatever objects\u2014 the tables and chairs and ceiling and floor,\npossible and actuals, pasts and futures\u2014are within my present\npurview, and also a beatific Buddha somewhere else whom I am not, or\nthe possible existence of such a Buddha, or the Buddha I will\nbe in the future, or even one I might be in the future. As in\nthe case of past, present and future, even to experience myself\nspecifically as not a Buddha is also to be apprehending\nBuddhahood in some mode or form. To see myself as deluded and\nsuffering is to also be experiencing the absence of some contrasting\nstate; in our example, if part of what I think about is how very\nnot a Buddha I presently am (perhaps in the context of a\nrepentance ritual, but also in simply noting the magnitude of my own\ngreed, anger and delusion), then my apprehension also includes this\nBuddhahood in the mode of its not-presence, internal to this present\nmoment just as the sense of contrasting pastness and futureness in\ngeneral always are. But the copresence of both my delusion and\nsuffering and the imagined bliss and wisdom of an imagined Buddha whom\nI am not, both present in this single instant of experience, is not to\nbe imaged like the case of a durational object with two distinct and\nopposed qualities to it, like, for example, a piece of pastry with\nboth a sweet portion and a bitter portion (due to a baking mishap,\nperhaps!). If I bite into this pastry and happen to take in both the\nsweet and the bitter at once, I can conceive of these as genuinely\nseparate because I can compare to other pieces of pastry which are\neither completely sweet or completely bitter, or the sweetness and\nbitterness separated out from all pastry and present in other foods,\nand I can resolve to henceforth, in my next bite, take only the sweet\nand not the bitter, for the pastry will persist through time, waits\nfor me to relate to it in another moment in a potentially different\nway. Alternate ways of experiencing the pastry, or of zeroing in on\none portion rather than another, or comparisons to other experiences,\nare available due to the fact that a durational object is something\nother than the moments of its existence; the different moments of its\nexistence exist in a neutral shared medium, either space and time for\na physical object or, even in the case of a purely mental object, at\nleast time. As we have seen, this is not true for the instant of\nexperience, which shares no neutral medium with other moments; again,\nprecisely because they are themselves nothing but time, two moments of\ntime cannot be compared except in a third moment which differs from\nboth (although this difference is immanent to all three moments, and\ntherefore the two differing terms is immanent to all three\nmoments\u2014and in that sense they do not differ, as we shall see in more\ndetail below). I cannot revisit this moment, and I cannot compare it,\nand I cannot abstract from it. There is never even the possibility of\nan instance of encountering one of these without also encountering the\nother. If I experience both the sweet and the bitter once, however\nfleetingly, though they are both instantly gone in the next moment, in\nanother sense they are eternally together, indeed they are aspects of\na single thing, always and exceptionless encountered together. For in\ngeneral, when we judge two things to be \u201cthe same\u201d we mean\nthat they it is impossible to encounter or even consider one without\nconsidering the other; they are inalienably and always together. When\nI say \u201cwater is the same as H2O,\u201d I mean that\nthese are two names for the same thing: whenever anyone encounters\nwater they are encountering H2O, whenever anyone encounters\nH2O they are encountering water. They would be distinct\nentities only if it is at least conceivable that they can in fact be\nseparated, that one might occur without the other. This also applies\nto different \u201caspects\u201d of a single fact which are always\nencountered together\u2014for example, the pitch and the volume of a\nmusical note. We might think that, although every pitch has a volume\nand every volume has a pitch, so they are always encountered together,\nthey are still meaningfully said to be different aspects because I can\ndistinguish between them, enumerating different parameters and\ncharacteristics of each. But again, this distinguishing of aspects\nhappens only after the initial apprehension of them\ntogether\u2014in a subsequent moment\u2014and depends entirely on the\npossibility that the pitch and the volume can change in different\nways, i.e., that the pitch might remain constant while the volume\nchanges or vice versa. This is not possible when the two are\napprehended only as existing together in a single moment: there is no\npossibility of any change in either of them. The distinguishing of\ndifferent \u201caspects\u201d requires hypostasizing the note as an\nentity with some kind of existence independent of its momentary\nappearance, a durational object of contemplation. The thought about\nthe different aspects of the note belongs to another moment, and is a\nnew object in its own right which belongs inalienably to its moment,\njust as the initial apprehension of the total note, with its exact\npitch and volume and none other, belonged to the first moment. They\ncan only be considered different if they are in principle separable in\nsome way, and that is not the case for the elements of the moment.\nThey are therefore not different from one another.\n\nYet, though I must experience both the Buddhahood and the\nnon-Buddhahood as indivisible components of a single moment, never to\nbe repeated in isolation, it is also true that both are non-different\nfrom every other instance of both Buddhahood and non-Buddahood in all\nother moments. Each is constantly extending itself in an infinity of\nforms, including in the forms of each other. For, as touched on\nbriefly above, to be experienced as \u201coccurring\u201d at all, a\npresent moment must also include within it some sense of the contrast\nto a gone past and a coming future, which thus must also be\napprehended within it somehow. \u201cOther\u201d moments are present\neven in this moment itself \u201cas\u201d the sense of surpassed\npastness and to-come futurity that are the necessary contrasts that\nconstitute its own sense of presentness. The experienced pastness and\nfutureness are thus necessary components of the present qua present,\nbut like any other components, they are not genuinely distinct parts\nor aspects that can be detached from the total moment. This means not\nonly that the present sense of pastness and futureness, like all the\nother components of the present moment, can only be experienced at the\nsame time as all the other components of this single moment, and thus\nare absolutely non-same with anything in any past or future moment.\nBut this also means, conversely, that they are non-different from the\ncontents of every other moment, for the same reasons that the moments\nas wholes are non-different: there is no neutral medium in which to\ncompare them. The distinctness of my present vague intimation of\ntomorrow and the actual events that come to take place tomorrow is as\nimmanent to tomorrow as it is to the present: tomorrow\u2019s\nexperience of disconfirmation of today\u2019s expectation is immanent\nto that moment tomorrow, and experience of this disparity necessarily\nincludes both of the two disparate terms: yesterday\u2019s\nexpectation of the future is thus also an inalienable component of\ntomorrow\u2019s single whole moment in which it is disconfirmed.\nFuture moments when they do occur are neither the same nor different\nfrom the vague representation of the future in the previous moment;\nthey might be seen as absolutely distinct (as in commonsensical views\nof an \u201cimagined\u201d as opposed to a \u201creal\u201d\nfuture), or conversely as further articulations of the previous vague\nintimation; but in fact the \u201cvague intimation of future\u201d\nin question has no fixed nature to be same as or different from,\nprecisely because this element of the present moment, like all the\nother elements, is not really a distinct part or aspect existing\nbeyond the moment in which it occurs, is not a durational entity at\nall, but merely an unrepeatable and indivisible component of a\nparticular moment, neither same nor different from the other\ncomponents of that moment. So we must say the future is neither\ncompletely different from the imagined future contributing to the\ncomposition of a past moment, nor completely identical to that\nimagined future\u2014or if we prefer, both. Thus do we speak of the\npermanence-impermanence, the impermanence-permanence, not only of\nevery moment, but of every component of every moment.\n\nA moment is intrinsically fleeting, gone as soon as it arises. I\ncannot prolong it or remain in it. But note also that, if this moment\nis not characterizable as \u201cdifferent\u201d from any other\nmoment, I also can never actually leave this moment: whatever\nsubsequent moments may appear, they are non-different from this one.\nThis non-difference is apprehended in the single upsurge of the\nunchangeable moment as its own internal sense of its difference from\npast and future moments: they are present there, in some form or\nother, precisely however vaguely or distinctly they are within that\none experience, as inalienable aspects of that moment itself. The next\nmoment, when new contents appear, will be experienced as more\nof or other expressions of the same moment. That moment,\nthough radically impermanent, is thus also experienced as permanent\nand necessary, just like a \u201csubstance\u201d in Spinoza\u2019s\nsense: it can be conceived only as existing, since it just is its\nbeing conceived; and it can only be conceived as existing exactly as\nit does exist; it is infinite and indivisible, since whatever appears\nas its limit or divider is ipso facto internal to it, one more\ncomponent of it, and the conception of only a \u201cpart\u201d of it\nwill simply be by definition a different moment; and by the same\ntoken, it cannot be acted upon by anything external to it, it is\ninfinitely productive, and everything it produces is more of itself.\nThe moment is both radically impermanent and radically eternal. More\nto the point, its impermanence is its permanence, its permanence is\nits impermanence\u2014exactly the claims of Tiantai\u2019s\ntheoretical conclusions. I experience the eternity-temporality of this\nmoment continuing to show itself in and as the\nneither-same-nor-different array of all other possible experiences,\nbeings, ideas, moments. This is mode in which we find the direct\nexperience of Buddhahood-as-all-sentient-beings, and\nall-sentient-beings-as-Buddahood.\n\nSo it is that after gaining some facility in this sort of reduction of\nall time to the present moment and of all concrete and abstract\nobjects as well as subjective states to the single instant of\nexperience, we are to notice how this instantiates, in an immediate\nexperiential way, the \u201cinconceivable\u201d character of all\nphenomenon, which was independently asserted on theoretical grounds in\ndoctrinal writings: we are to notice that neither sameness nor\ndifference applies to the relation between any of the contents of this\nexperience as apprehended above. This applies to the relation of one\nmoment to another, to the relation of the knowing activity and the\nknown objects, and also to the relations among all the many component\nobjects themselves: none are the same as each other, none are\ndifferent from one another. As such, this is a direct experience of\nthe Ultimate Reality of all Phenomena, precisely in the experience of\nthe phenomena themselves in all their distinctness. And in as much as\nthis is simply what is in fact going on in all actual temporal\nexperience, all experience is discovered to be the Ultimate Reality of\nall Phenomena.\n\nThe above gives us a roadmap of the agenda for Tiantai meditation: to\nexperience the Three Thousand as a single moment of experience and\nthus as neither-same-nor-difference both with each other and with that\nmoment as a whole. But how is all of the above actually to be\nrealized, not just conceptually or theoretically, but\nexperientially? Zhiyi does, in that same work, lay out ritual\nprocedures for inducing a direct experience of a single moment as the\ntotality of existence, brilliantly expounding the salvifically\nparadoxical effects this would have, in terms quite resonant to\nwhat we\u2019ve explored above\u2014for example in the section on the\nfirst of the Four Samadhis, the \u201cOne-Practice\nSamadhi.\u201d (See Ziporyn, 2016, pp. 273\u2013275 for an English\ntranslation of this passage; for an alternate translation, see Swanson\n2018, Volume 1, pp. 252\u2013261). Another procedure for isolating\nthe moment, through introspection and analysis, freeze-framing\nit so that one sees \u201cno motion or turning, no source or\ndestination, nowhere it comes from and nowhere it goes to\u201d\n(\u884c\u8005\u5fc3\u6578\u8d77\u6642\uff0c\u8fd4\u7167\u89c0\u5bdf\uff0c\u4e0d\u898b\u52d5\u8f49\u3001\u6839\u6e90\u7d42\u672b\u3001\u4f86\u8655\u53bb\u8655), and\nthen discovering through analysis that no coherent boundaries can be\nfound between this frozen moment and its excluded past and\nfuture, is offered in the \u201cSamadhi of Awareness of One\u2019s Own\nThoughts,\u201d described in the fourth of the Four Samadhis (see Swanson\n2018, pp. 323\u2013386). But in the practice under discussion here,\nsingled out by later tradition as the most central and distinctive\nform of specifically Tiantai meditation, crucially, we are instead not\ninstructed to try to get this done by directly thinking about it or\nwilling it, by attempting to expand our conception of mentation to\ninclude all these contents, to overstep the habitual subject-object\ndivide by fiat, or by the application of the by-now-familiar\ndialectical refutation of the categories of sameness and difference as\nfound in the doctrine of the Three Truths. All of these are here\nregarded as futile; they would still land us in the merely theoretical\nterritory of the \u201cconceivable,\u201d where the habitual\ncategories would automatically reimpose themselves. The attempt to\nunravel these categories deliberately ends up further entangling us in\nthem, for it means trying to attain a new kind of experience or\nconceptualization that is simply \u201cdifferent\u201d from the\nordinary ones\u2014as we found to be unavoidable in the description of\nthese desiderata given in theoretical terms above. These categories of\nsame and different are as deeply embedded in the attempt to dispel\nthem as in that which it attempts to dispel. Rather, the practical\napplication of these ideas is done in precisely the opposite way from\nwhat one might expect: it is done not by deciding to expand our\napprehension of the mind or moment to include all, to view all\nencountered contents as constituents of a single moment of experience,\nand then succeeding in doing so. Rather, it is done precisely by\ntrying to exclude all other experiences from this moment of\nexperience, to dispel them, and then failing to do so. It is\ndone by tracing out and thinking about what the moment includes, but\nmerely by settling our attention on the moment qua moment, on the\nmomentariness of the moment as an instantaneous and unchangeable\nand unrepeatable single flash of experience: on the\ninfinitesimal smallness of its duration, how little is within its\nexpanse, its utter failure to occupy almost all of time and all of\nreality. For it is only thus that one directly experiences all\nexternal time and reality making themselves impossible to exclude,\nexperiencing first-hand the necessity of their inclusion. How so?\n\nAll the various characteristics and relations of things are here to be\napprehended, as we\u2019ve said, as \u201cdwelling together in (or\nas) a single moment of mentation\u201d\n(\u540c\u5c45\u4e00\u5ff5). So far this resembles a perhaps\nfamiliar \u201cphenomenological reduction\u201d of all experience to\ntheir manner of appearing to the subject. But it is not \u201cthe\nsubject\u201d as such that is at issue in this Buddhist context.\nRather, the traditional Buddhist stress on momentariness is to be\nremembered: it is a reduction of all objects to subjective experience,\nbut subjective experience itself is understood as a temporal series of\nputatively discrete instantaneous mental events. So we are aiming at a\nphenomenological reduction of all moments of experience to a single\npresent moment. On the theoretical level, however, Mah\u0101y\u0101na\nphilosophy had already long exploded the viability of taking this\npre-Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist concept of momentary experience\nliterally as ultimate truth, as if these moments were actual entities\nthat were simply \u201cdifferent\u201d from one another, showing\ninstead that these moments stipulated by earlier Buddhist philosophers\nare \u201cempty\u201d of self-nature: no consistent metaphysical\nunpacking of this idea of discrete moments is possible. This\nrefutation certainly was always understood to mean that in ultimate\ntruth there could be no such entities as moments with predicates of\n\u201csame\u201d or \u201cdifferent\u201d legitimately applied to\nthem. For not being actual entities at all, and thus certainly not\ndifferent, they also could not be said to be the same, nor could any\nother predicates be validly attached to them; what does not exist\ncannot have any predicates. But where does that leave us? It might be\ntaken simply as a call to free ourselves from all conceptualization,\nall metaphysical views, and to deal instead with reality just as it is\nappears to us in our practical everyday experience. But in practical\nterms, this \u201cjust as it is appears\u201d too often reverts to\nseeing experienced time in the same old way, or even in the\npre-Buddhist way: not as instantaneous moments which are simply and\nabsolutely different from one another, to be sure, but reified as\ndiscrete clumps of experienced time which are simply and\nabsolutely different from one another, a past experience that is an\nentirely different entity from the present experience, a present that\nis different from the future. Unfortunately, this is precisely the\npresupposition that underwrites all of our delusive desires and\nattachments: the idea that past experience and the future experience\nare mutually exclusive, structured just like metaphysically\nconstituted \u201cthings\u201d in that they have consistent\nself-identities, such that one can move from suffering experience to\nnon-suffering experience in a non-ambiguous way\u2014another view\ndemolished by the very same Mah\u0101y\u0101na philosophy of\nEmptiness. This preservation of the conventional is of course\nessential to Buddhist practice, and for some Buddhist schools the\nimpossibility of giving any consistent metaphysical explanation of\nthis conventional experience of progressive time is therefore a\nfeature rather than a bug. It safeguards the necessary conventional\napprehension of progressive time and the possible achievement of truly\ncontinent and disparate states at different times that must be assumed\nfor the practice of the Buddhist path, and blocks any temptation for\nan alternative model of temporality, which on this view would be just\nbe one more metaphysical distraction and distortion of the practical\nsoteriological realities involved. The Tiantai position is also\nstrenuously committed to preserving the viability of this conventional\nmodel of progressive time for purposes of Buddhist practice, but only\nin closest tandem with the most robust possible understanding of the\ncontrary side of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na theoretical apparatus: the\nnon-difference of sams\u0101ra and nirv\u0101na, of affliction and\nwisdom, of suffering and the end of suffering. The practice focusing\non \u201call dwelling together as a single moment\u201d is designed\nto bring these two sides of Buddhist philosophy together in practice,\nas they are brought together in theory in the doctrine of the Three\nTruths. Phenomenologically as well as theoretically, this means seeing\nthat both the early Buddhist view of \u201cmomentariness\u201d (the\nidea that all experience takes place only in the instantaneous\n\u201cnow\u201d) and the alleged alternatives to this, for example\nthe perhaps more commonsensical \u201cspecious present\u201d of\nJamesian psychology (i.e., that there are no experiences that can take\nplace in an instantaneous moment, because mental reality always comes\nwith an experienced fringe of past and future, a short span of\ndiscernible and certainly finite duration to be strummed through), are\nseen equally as one-sided distortions, because both are equally true.\nBoth momentariness and duration are incoherent explanations of\nexperience, although both are unavoidable: they are locally coherent\nbut globally incoherent. The first is impossible because experience\nrequires contrast, and contrast requires a simultaneously present\nmultiplicity of moments to strum through. The latter merely pushes the\nproblem back one step, positing a new slightly larger oneness, and\nstipulating that its boundaries are vague without trying to work out\nhow a boundary that is vague can still function as a real boundary,\nthus setting up an infinite regress, abandoning the possibility of\ndetermining precisely where a single experience begins or ends but\ncontinuing to treat it practically as finite, i.e., as mutually\nexclusive with other experiences (as is the premise of all ordinary\nsense of identity and motivated action); the component parts of the\nspecious present, in spite of their constituent bleed-over into one\nanother, remain trackable as qualitatively distinct parts, and the\nspecious present as a whole continues to function as an\nunproblematically distinct though extended unit, a particular specious\npresent that is different from all the other specious presents\nexperienced by oneself and others at other times and places. The\nformer stresses the \u201cone,\u201d the latter stresses the\n\u201cmany,\u201d but in reality experience is neither one nor many,\nboth one and many; neither same nor different, both same and\ndifferent. All experience is instantaneous, and yet all\nexperience extends beyond itself into past and future\u2014and this\nnow applies as much to a specious present as to an instantaneous\npresent. Rather than seeing one of these views as true and the other\nas a pernicious distortion (for example, because the surreptitious\napplication of objective or spatial categories is distorting what is\nactually observed phenomenologically), both are admitted as precise\nand unavoidable aspects of what it is for an experience to be an\nexperience. The alternative between them is thus viewed as a case of\naspect-change, as in the Wittgensteinian duck-rabbit; we can switch\nfrom seeing the moment of experience as instantaneous or as extended\nand enduring to make sense of its manifold content, but normally\ncannot see both, or grasp the necessary connection between these\nmutually exclusive ways of apprehending it. Tiantai meditation is\naimed at experiencing both of these aspects at once, a flat picture\nthat is also three-dimensional, a flash of an instant which is also\nextended without any definite limits, for their necessary though\nparadoxical relationship reveals the true nature of all the contents\nof experience as neither-same-nor-different.\n\nThe method amounts to a deliberate experience of the\nnecessary failure of the phenomenological reduction to either\none of the two aspects, but generally focusing on the necessity and\nfailure of the aspect of momentariness: one tries to shrink the\nexperience of time down to a single point, to isolate the moment, and\nthereby discovers that even when maximally compressed in this way, the\nentire expanse of contents, of places and times outside this point,\nresurges in full irreducible splendor, but now as the\ninalienable and indivisible halo of this instant. The necessary\nfailure of the reduction is the reverse revelation of the Inherent\nEntailment of all the Three Thousand, all of which, however peripheral\nor modal, are now seen to be just as much as inalienable components of\nits present manifestation as more central and distinct ones; the same\ngoes for the unequal focus that makes some central and some\nperipheral\u2014it too is to be equally included as an inalienable\ncomponent of the manifestation just as it is. As if by squeezing a\nspring down to its minimal extent, one discovers the irrepressibility\nand immensity of its expansive power. By attempting in all good faith\nto isolate the moment as sharply as possible, one discovers that even\nwhen sliced away from all the rest of existence, all the rest of\nexistence ineluctably springs back, now as an undetachable and\nunchangeable nimbus which is experienced at once as internal and\nexternal to that moment, and in which all contents are necessarily\npresent exactly as they are, such that none can be removed or\nrepositioned, and yet all are equally extending infinitely into past\nand future in an infinity of transformations. Having enumerated all\nthat exists, all that one is not, all that is future and past, all\nthat is merely possible rather than actual, all that is imagined\nrather than real, one tries with all one\u2019s might to exclude it\nfrom the bare reality of this moment, staring fixedly only at the here\nand now. One fails: the totality of the Three Thousand floods back\nright here in and as this moment, albeit now bracingly transformed\ninto a single boundaryless cloud of surrounding contents\nsimultaneously flashing forth, in as it were a glorified form\u2014a\nsingle flash of a specifically structured instantaneous unit wherein\neach of the variegated components is neither same as nor different\nfrom each of the others, indeed where none is same as or different\nfrom the moment as a whole. By concentrating only on the rabbit in an\nattempt to make the duck completely disappear from consciousness, one\ndiscovers that the duck comes back with a vengeance, and with a new\nadamantine vividness concomitant to the power revealed by its\nunexcludability. That Mobius strip of separation as inclusion and\ninclusion as separation is the Three Truths in their constantly\navailable lived form, the phenomenological revelation of their nature\nas neither-same-nor-different going on in every moment of every\nsentient being\u2019s experience.\n\nSo to summarize: we start by mulling over all that we can think of as\npossible states of experience, enumerating all these Three Thousand\nstates of conceivable entities and all their interrelations, pausing\nto visualize whatever is possible or actual, in part and in whole,\nwhat I am and what I am not. But this mulling over requires some time\nto go through. When we have finished thinking of all we can think of,\nwe are asked to pause and consider the present moment of\nconsciousness, which is now in a position to recall all that thinking\nas having happened in the very recent past\u2014i.e., at\n\u201canother\u201d time. We try to isolate this single moment of\nlooking back at the long process of mulling, squeezing it down to a\nsingle flash to which all the previously recalled contents are\nexternal\u2014\u201cthe slightest wisp of mental activity\u201d\n(\u4ecb\u723e\u6709\u5fc3), as Zhiyi calls it in that key\npassage, arising in the instant when the organ of cognition first\ntakes notice of its object of cognition. In focusing on the\ninstantaneousness of the flash of cognition engaged in recalling the\nprocess of mulling through the list of all that could exist,\nconsidering that mulling as past, one is attempting to locate and\nfocus on a moment that excludes those moments when the mulling was\ngoing on. But in the very act of excluding them, we find all these\ncontents present to us, precisely as contents to be excluded. At once\nconsciousness is squeezed down to the tiniest possible flash and\nsimultaneously experiences the upsurge of all its excluded contents\nextending to infinity. The rabbitness of the duck and the duckness of\nthe rabbit surge forth at once. Are the previous moments spent mulling\nover all conceivable being the same as or different from the present\none looking back on them? Neither. All those other moments are present\nhere as this moment of excluding them\u2014neither same nor\ndifferent. Are the Three Thousandfold contents within this moment the\nsame as or different from each other, from the moment as a whole, or\nfrom the contents of putatively other moments also included among its\ncontents? Neither, as we\u2019ve explored at length above. But this\nis now present to us directly in the singularity of the temporal\nmoment and its indistinguishability from its multiple contents.\n\nWhen this consciousness next turns toward the external world, moving\non from recollecting the past to encountering the future, reinitiating\ncontact with unpredictable circumstances, it finds all of these new\nexperiences to be in the same relation to that single moment of\nmeditative recollection as the contents of the recollection had been.\nEvery content encountered has already been present,\n\u201cnon-differently,\u201d in that moment of recollection\ncontemplated in the meditation, though of course its new details and\nsurprising contents ensure that it is also, as expected,\n\u201cnon-same.\u201d All other experiences present themselves\nas this moment of experience, in its very isolation from\nthem. On the one hand, nothing about this moment can ever be changed;\non the other hand, none of its elements has a definite self-nature\nthat could remain the same. Endless versions of its (non-different)\nself extend into infinite (non-same) other moments. They are\ninalienable components and not merely parts of those other moments,\nand they exist nowhere other than in those non-same moments, and as\nnothing but inalienable non-repeatable components of those non-same\nmoments, neither same nor different from each new moment as a whole\nand from all its other components. All subsequent moments are in this\nway experienced as versions of this moment, endless (non-same)\ntransformations and extensions of its (non-different) self for all\neternity, but by the same token, this moment itself is experienced as\na version of all other moments, existing only as the (non-same)\ntransformation and extension of the very (non-different) self of every\nother moment past and future. As Zhiyi is quoted as saying, \u201cAs\neach mental act, itself ultimae reality, connects to each content,\nitself ultimate reality, conditional states, each being ultimate\nreality, arise one after another. Ultimate reality and ultimate\nreality pour into each other one after another: such is the effortless\nentrance into the principle of ultimate reality\u201d\n(\u5be6\u5fc3\u7e6b\u5be6\u5883\uff0c\u5be6\u7de3\u6b21\u7b2c\u751f\uff0c\u5be6\u5be6\u8fed\u76f8\u6ce8\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u5165\u5be6\u7406).\nZhanran explains, \u201cAs each mental act connects to its contents,\nthe contents also necessarily connect to the mental act.\nThis interconnection of mental act and contents is what is meant by a\nconditional state that is itself ultimate reality. Subsequent mental\nacts arise one after another, here described as \u2018pouring into\neach other\u2019: mental act pours into contents, contents pour into\ncontents, contents pour into mental act. Every mental act and every\ncontent pour into each other with each moment of experience,\ncontinuing with never a gap or pause in every instant, naturally and\neffortlessly bringing about every stage of realization.\u201d\n(\u5fc3\u82e5\u7e6b\u5883\uff0c\u5883\u5fc5\u7e6b\u5fc3\u3002\u5fc3\u5883\u76f8\u7e6b\uff0c\u540d\u70ba\u5be6\u7de3\u3002\u5fa9\u6cb9\u5f8c\u5fc3\uff0c\u5fc3\u5fc3\u76f8\u7e8c\uff0c\u540d\u8fed\u76f8\u6ce8\u3002\u5373\u662f\u5fc3\u6ce8\u65bc\u5883\uff0c\u5883\u6ce8\u65bc\u5fc3\uff0c\u5883\u6ce8\u65bc\u5883\uff0c\u5883\u6ce8\u65bc\u5fc3\uff0c\u5fc3\u5fc3\u5883\u5883\uff0c\u5ff5\u5ff5\u76f8\u6ce8\uff0c\u5982\u662f\u6b21\u7b2c\uff0c\u524e\u90a3\u7121\u9593\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u5f9e\u65bc\u89c0\u884c\u3001\u76f8\u4f3c\u4ee5\u5165\u5206\u8b49\uff0c\u6545\u4e91\u5165\u5be6\n\u3002 (\u6e5b\u7136\uff0c\u300c\u6b62\u89c0\u7fa9\u4f8b\u300d\uff0c\u5377\u4e00))\nSuch is the vista to be realized in Tiantai meditational practice, and\nthe manner in which it then extends into all the diverse experiences\none may go on to encounter as one arises from meditation and enters\nthe world\u2014the permanence-impermanence of Buddhahood-delusion\nthat arises and perishes in an instant and goes on forever.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["And\u014d Toshio \u5b89\u85e4\u4fca\u96c4, 1964,\n\u201cNyorai seiaku sis\u014d no s\u014dsetsusha: Guandingsetsu he no\nhanron\n\u5982\u6765\u6027\u60aa\u601d\u60f3\u306e\u5275\u8aaa\u8005:\n\u704c\u9802\u8aaa\u3078\u306e\u53cd\u8ad6 (The Author\nof the Theory of the Buddha\u2019s Inherent Evil: A Refutation of\nGuanding\u2019s Authorship)\u201d, <em>\u014ctani Gakuh\u014d</em>\n\u5927\u8c37\u5b66\u5831 (The Journal of Buddhism &amp;\nCultural Science), 44(1): 1\u201322.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1973, <em>Tendai sh\u014dgu\nshis\u014dron</em>\n\u5929\u53f0\u6027\u5177\u601d\u60f3\u8ad6 (On the\nTiantai Theory of Nature-Inclusion), Kyoto: H\u014dz\u014dkan.", "Chen Jian \u9648\u575a, 2007, <em>Fannao ji puti: Tiantai\n\u201cxing\u2019e\u201d sixiang yanjiu</em>\n\u70e6\u607c\u5373\u83e9\u63d0\u2014\u5929\u53f0\u6027\u6076\u601d\u60f3\u7814\u7a76\n(Defilement is Identical to Enlightenment: An Investigation of the\nTiantai Doctrine of Inherent Evil), Beijing: Zongjiao wenhua.", "Chen Yingshan \u9673\u82f1\u5584, 1997, <em>Tiantai yuanqi\nzhongdao shixiang lun</em>\n\u5929\u53f0\u7de3\u8d77\u4e2d\u9053\u5be6\u76f8\u8ad6\n(On the Tiantai Theory of Middle-way Reality Based on Dependant\nArising), Taipei: Fagu Wenhua.", "Clower, Jason, 2010, <em>The Unlikely Buddhologist: Tiantai\nBuddhism in Mou Zongsan\u2019s New Confucianism</em>, Leiden [etc.]:\nBrill.", "Dong Ping \u8463\u5e73, 2002, <em>Tiantaizong yanjiu</em>\n\u5929\u53f0\u5b97\u7814\u7a76 (A Study on the Tiantai\nSchool), Shanghai: Shanghai Guji.", "Donner, Neal, 1987, \u201cChih-i\u2019s Meditation on\nEvil\u201d, in <em>Buddhist and Taoist Practice in Medieval Chinese\nSociety</em>, edited by David.
