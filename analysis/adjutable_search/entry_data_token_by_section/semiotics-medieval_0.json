The late ancient sources of medieval semiotics\n\n\nThe core set of ideas and doctrines from which medieval philosophers\ndeveloped their semiotic theories was provided to them mainly by two\nlate ancient authors. Besides Boethius (480\u2013528), who transmitted\nAristotelian semantics to the Latin Middle Ages, Augustine's (354\u2013430)\ndoctrine of sign is the most important junction of ancient and medieval\ntheories of sign and signification. Augustine's doctrine also has to be\nseen as a decisive turning point in the history of semiotics.\n",
