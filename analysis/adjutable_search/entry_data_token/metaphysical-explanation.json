The present entry focuses on a\nfamily of explanations widely thought to be in some sense\ndistinctively metaphysical in character. Consider the\nfollowing non-exhaustive list of putative examples, which ought to be\nrecognizable to any metaphysician:\n\n(1)\nSocrates the philosopher, and this bust of him in our seminar\nroom, are both snub nosed because they share the property being\nsnub-nosed.\n(2)\nSocrates\u2019s cloak has a color because it is green.\n(3)\nSocrates is the very individual he is at least in part because he\nhas Sophroniscus as a father.\n(4)\nSocrates is just because his soul is well-ordered.\n\n\nStatements like (1)\u2013(4) at least purport to express\nexplanations on their surface: \u201cbecause\u201d is a\ncommon explanatory idiom, and any of a number of others could have\nbeen used instead (e.g., \u201cin virtue of\u201d, \u201caccounts\nfor\u201d, \u201cis the reason why\u201d, \u201cmakes it the case\nthat\u201d, or simply \u201cexplains\u201d). Moreover, statements\nlike (1)\u2013(4) are metaphysical at least in the sense\nthat they are commonly put forward and assessed in metaphysics, and\nproceed by citing distinctions of importance to metaphysics in some\nilluminating way. These include distinctions of\n property-instance,\n determinable-determinate,\n essence-accident,\n and\n analysans-analysandum\nthat appear to be at play in the examples above; others might include\n part-whole\n (e.g., \u201cThe vase is fragile because of its crystalline\nmicrostructure\u201d) and\n member-set\n (e.g., \u201cThe set {Socrates} exists because Socrates\nexists\u201d), among potentially others still.\n\n\nInterest in metaphysical explanation has witnessed a recent spike, yet\nthe topic is not a recent metaphysical innovation. Indeed, it is front\nand center in the very first sentence of the field\u2019s\nfoundational text, when Aristotle tells us that \u201cAll human\nbeings by nature desire to know\u201d (Metaphysics I.1,\n980a21; see the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics).\n For Aristotle, this desire is not fully satisfied until one\nunderstands the basic explanatory factors responsible for the broad\nstructure of reality (see Lear 1988: chs. 1 and 6). Set aside whether\nAristotle\u2019s claim about human nature is correct. Even if it is\nnot, a wealth of philosophical questions about the nature, varieties,\nand scope of metaphysical explanation emerge. Are these\n\u201cexplanatory factors\u201d of one type or many, and what are\nthey? What is it about \u201cthe broad structure of reality\u201d\nthat they explain? What type of understanding is gained by grasping\nthese explanatory factors? And even if human beings by nature desire\nmetaphysical explanations, to what extent (if any) can this natural\ndesire actually be satisfied?\n\nHistorical interest in metaphysical explanation was not\nAristotle\u2019s alone. Philosophers as diverse as Plato,\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (Avicenna), William of Ockham,\nSpinoza, Leibniz, Bolzano, Duhem, and Husserl (see Mulligan 2004 and\nalso\n related entries\n below), among many others, explicitly grappled with questions such as\nthose above, although some in a more skeptical vein than others.\nMoreover, countless other philosophers both inside metaphysics and out\nclearly presuppose that the notion is in good standing when discussing\nthe various types of metaphysical explanation that we discuss below.\nOur goal in the present entry, however, is not to provide a full\naccounting of how the concept has developed over time\u2014here, we\nfocus on framing the main questions and disputes that emerge when one\nattempts to state what metaphysical explanation is, exactly, and how\nit is supposed to work (if at all).\n\nOur first order of business is to clarify in what sense metaphysical\nexplanation is a form of non-causal explanation\n (\u00a71),\n and survey some putative varieties of metaphysical explanation\n (\u00a72).\n Afterwards, we survey three central, connected choice-points about\nhow to think about metaphysical explanation at the most abstract\nlevel. How are metaphysical explanations related to notions of\nnon-causal relationships such as property-instance, part-whole,\nessence-accident, derivative-ground, role-realizer, and others of\ncentral metaphysical importance that metaphysical explanations are\nsaid to derive their explanatory power from\n (\u00a73)?\n To what extent is metaphysical explanation a unified phenomenon\n (\u00a74)?\n And to what extent is it an objective, mind-independent phenomenon\n (\u00a75)?\n Next, we survey a recent research program that attempts to extend one\nof the four main models of scientific\nexplanation\u2014causal-mechanistic, nomological, unificationist, and\npragmatic\u2014to metaphysical explanation\n (\u00a76).\n We conclude by surveying some questions about the scope of\nmetaphysical explanation\n (\u00a77).\n\nA clarificatory comment: for stylistic reasons, we will continue to\nshift back-and-forth between speaking of explanations as\ntruths of a certain kind that can be discovered and argued\nover, versus speaking of them as activities by which those\ntruths are communicated or understood. That distinction, as well as\nwhether explanations are in fact something else (e.g.,\ntheories in a model-theoretic sense), will rise to the\nforefront later, but for now, we will speak loosely.\n", "toc": [{"#MetaExplFormNonCausExpl": "1.

Metaphysical explanation as a form of non-causal explanation\n\nTo help us focus in on the topic at hand, contrast examples\n(1)\u2013(4) above with familiar examples of causal\nexplanation\u2014for instance, the disappearance of a puddle through\nevaporation because of the warmth of the surrounding air. What makes\nthis an instance of explanation is a matter for debate, although a\ngood enough approximation for our purposes is that it turns on how (in\nthis case causal) explanation works. As Lange puts it: a causal\nexplanation\n\n\nderives its explanatory power by virtue of supplying relevant\ninformation about the explanandum\u2019s causes or, more broadly,\nabout the world\u2019s network of causal relations. (Lange 2016:\n18)\n\n\nA puddle\u2019s disappearance does not merely coincide with\nthe warmth of the surrounding air, but rather occurs because\nof it, at least in part thanks to causal interactions between the two\nsystems over time.\n\nIn contrast, metaphysical explanations at least appear to work in a\nrather different manner. (1) seems to work at least in part due to\nsome relationship between Socrates and the bust of him on the one\nhand, and a fact about those two plus a further entity, a property, on\nthe other. Whatever that relationship is, it seems radically different\nfrom ordinary causal ones, for instance in being synchronic rather\nthan diachronic. The same can be said about (2), which invokes a\nsynchronic relationship between a determinable property and its\ndeterminates. Similarly, (3) seems to work at least in part due to how\nthe essential nature of a thing non-causally constrains what features\nit can have, while (4) seems to work at least in part due to there\nbeing no difference between being just and having a well-ordered soul,\nwhich would appear to preclude any causal relationships between\nthem.\n\nIt is in the minimal sense above that all should agree with the claim\nthat metaphysical explanation is a form of non-causal explanation (see\nSchaffer 2017: 303). Nonetheless, one must take care here in at least\nthree ways. First, metaphysical explanation should not be\nidentified with non-causal explanation. After all, there are\narguably many other forms of explanation besides metaphysical\nexplanation that are non-causal; we mentioned mathematical explanation\nabove. But this is not to say that metaphysical explanation has\nno role to play in how to understand these other types of\nnon-metaphysical non-causal explanations. Take, for example,\nSteiner\u2019s pioneering work on mathematical explanation, which\nstarts with the thought that \u201cto explain the behavior of an\nentity, one deduces the behavior from the essence or nature of the\nentity\u201d (Steiner 1978: 143). To the extent this works in the way\n(3) above works, by invoking the notion of essence, to that extent\nmathematical explanation involves a form of metaphysical\nexplanation.\n\nSecond, to say that metaphysical explanation is a form of non-causal\nexplanation does not mean that it is disconnected from the causal\nrealm altogether. Consider another example:\n\n(5)\nSocrates is in pain because the functional role of pain is\nrealized by the C-fibers firing in his brain.\n\n\nA functionalist about the mind might offer (5) as a part of a more\ncomprehensive metaphysical explanation of the nature of pain and its\ninstances. And yet, (5) invokes causation in at least two places. For\none thing, the explanans of (5)\u2014i.e., the fact which\ndoes the explaining\u2014invokes a type of causal process. In\naddition, the explanandum of a metaphysical\nexplanation\u2014i.e., the fact to be explained\u2014can invoke\ncausation, as for instance would be the case were one to offer up a\nmetaphysical explanation of causation itself. Thus what makes a\nmetaphysical explanation non-causal is not that the explanans or\nexplanandum are themselves non-causal, but rather that the\nrelationship between them is. For another thing, (5) works at\nleast in part due to the relationship between the functional role of a\nmental state and its realizer. So if this relationship itself consists\nin some relationship between the causal powers of a mental state and\nits realizer (perhaps the former must be a proper subset of the\nlatter; see J. Wilson 1999, Shoemaker 2001), then to that extent, (5)\nderives its explanatory power from causal facts. But (5) does not\nderive it solely from these, for presumably the relationship\nbetween the causal powers of a mental state and its realizer is not\nitself a causal one (in the case of Wilson and Shoemaker, it is the\nis a proper subset of relation).\n\nThird, although a useful starting point, it is not entirely\nuncontroversial to say that every form of metaphysical\nexplanation is a form of non-causal explanation. Take (2), which many\ntake to be a case of\n metaphysical grounding,\n the relationship by which more fundamental facts somehow \u201cgive\nrise to\u201d less fundamental ones. Although most theorists classify\ngrounding as non-causal, A. Wilson (2018) argues that grounding is\nliterally a form of \u201cmetaphysical causation\u201d, from which\nit would seem to follow that (2) is a form of causal explanation (see\n \u00a76.1\n below). Or take Bennett (2017: 61\u201362), who claims that\ncausation is an instance of what she calls \u201cmetaphysical\nbuilding\u201d, every instance of which is an instance of\nmetaphysical explanation (at least if understood as a wholly objective\nphenomenon, rather than one requiring that certain epistemic\nconditions hold; see\n \u00a75\n for more on realist vs. antirealist conceptions of metaphysical\nexplanation). Nor is our starting point, useful as it is, entirely\nunproblematic. Consider another example:\n\n(6)\nThe natural world began to exist because of the causal activity of\na supernatural being.\n\n\nDoes (6) count as a metaphysical explanation? It might seem to, given\na traditional conception of metaphysics as studying the \u201cfirst\ncauses of things\u201d (see the entry on\n metaphysics).\n And yet, it appears to work solely thanks to certain causal facts.\nBoth points can be reconciled with our framing so far. Whatever\n\u201cmetaphysical causation\u201d might be, surely it is not\ncausation of the ordinary sort that links sunlight to puddle\nevaporation over time, which is all that we meant to emphasize by\ncharacterizing metaphysical explanation as non-causal. And moreover,\nwhether to classify all explanations offered in metaphysics as\nmetaphysical explanations, rather than more narrowly as just those\nthat derive their explanatory power partly from non-causal factors, is\na matter of terminological decision not worth engaging with at length.\nClearly there is some important difference between\n(1)\u2013(5) as opposed to (6) in how they work, and that difference\nseems to have something to do with the non-causal ways in which they\nwork. That is a topic worth investigating, not whether to use\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d in the broader way or the narrower one.\n2. Some putative varieties of metaphysical explanation\n\nA classic argument for the existence of\nproperties\u2014mind-independent abstract entities, such as\nthose invoked in (1), that can be shared by multiple\nparticulars\u2014is that they are needed in order to metaphysically\nexplain the objective resemblances we find in the world (see the entry\non\n properties, especially \u00a7\u00a73\u20134).\n Both Socrates the philosopher and the bust of him in our seminar room\nare snub-nosed. However (so the argument goes), it cannot be a brute\nfact that this is so; there must be something in virtue of which both\nof these things, separated by space and time, are snub-nosed.\nSpecifically, (so the argument concludes), the fact that these two\nentities share the same property metaphysically explains why they\nresemble each other in this respect. Yet even if objective\nresemblances are, in fact, metaphysically explained by the\nsharing of properties by things that resemble\u2014a big\n\u201cif\u201d, although let us suppose so for illustrative\npurposes\u2014it remains to be said what kind of\nmetaphysical explanation is to be envisaged here. Reflecting on\n(2)\u2013(4) reveals at least three varieties of metaphysical\nexplanation that have been the focus of recent work on the topic and\nin terms of which (1) could be understood.\n\nOne option is to offer (1) as a grounding explanation. There\nis considerable controversy over what grounding is, and (as we shall\nsee) how grounding and explanations are related and how grounding\nexplanations work. We can stay somewhat neutral in saying that they\ntypically work by citing more fundamental facts\u2014in the case of\n(1), a fact about property sharing\u2014that in some sense\nnon-causally \u201cgives rise to\u201d, \u201cproduces\u201d, or\n\u201cgenerates\u201d less fundamental facts\u2014in this case, a\nfact of resemblance among particulars. We say \u201ctypically\u201d,\nsince one may count as grounding explanations those that merely\nprovide information about the grounds of a given fact\n(presumably of some contextually relevant type; see \u00a75.4), rather\nthan by citing its ground directly, as in (1*):\n\n(1*)\nSocrates the philosopher, and this bust of him in our seminar\nroom, are both snub-nosed because they share some property or\nother.\n\n\nAt any rate, to treat (1) and (1*) as grounding explanations would be\nto group them with (2), given a standardly held view, namely that\ninstances of the determinable-determinate relation are paradigmatic\ninstances of grounding.\n\nAlthough recent interest in metaphysical explanation arose from a\nrenewed interest in grounding over the mid to late twentieth century,\ngrounding explanation is arguably not the only form that metaphysical\nexplanation can take. This point was recognized as far back as\nAristotle, who in the Organon and Metaphysics\ndiscusses metaphysical explanations that work by citing facts about\n\u201cthe what it was to be\u201d of some target phenomenon (see,\ne.g., Posterior Analytics 83a7; Topics 141b35; and\nMetaphysics 1003b24, 1006a32, 1006b13), or what we would now\ncall its essence. Like grounding, there is controversy over\nwhat essence is; unlike grounding, much less has been said about how\nessence and explanation are related and how what might be called\nessentialist explanations work. We can again stay somewhat\nneutral in saying that they typically work by citing (or perhaps just\nproviding contextually relevant information about) part of what it is\nto be some phenomenon, in terms of some other phenomenon (e.g., Fine\n2015 and Koslicki 2012).\n\nOffering (1) as an essentialist explanation would be to group it with\n(3), which might suggest rather different truth conditions for (1)\nthan if it were offered as a grounding explanation. Prima\nfacie at least, (3) does not explicitly require that\nSocrates\u2019s having a certain man as a father be a more\nfundamental fact than him being the very individual he is. Moreover,\nit is widely held that the grounds of a fact are modally sufficient\nfor it to obtain, but need not be modally necessary for it, while the\nopposite is true for essence, which would place rather different\nconditions on whether a claim like (2) is true as opposed to a claim\nlike (3). Although a number of recent accounts of grounding analyze it\nin terms of essence (e.g., Correia 2013, Zylstra 2018), or vice versa\n(e.g., deRosset 2013, Gorman 2014), others do neither (e.g., Fine\n2012, 2015). As a provisional matter, we shall treat grounding\nexplanations as distinct from (yet perhaps related to) essentialist\nexplanations and leave open for now whether instances of the one imply\ninstances of the other.\n\nA third option is to instead offer (1) as what we will call a\nreductive explanation, which would be to group (1) with (4)\n(see the entry on\n scientific reduction).\n Like grounding and essence, there is some controversy over what\nreduction is, although somewhat more has been said about how reduction\nand explanation are related and how reductive explanations work than\nin the case of essence. We can again stay somewhat neutral in saying\nthat reductive explanations typically work by \u201canalyzing\u201d\nor \u201cbreaking down\u201d some phenomenon as \u201cnothing more\nthan\u201d another phenomenon. Although a number of recent accounts\nof reduction analyze the notion in terms of grounding, or essence, or\nboth (e.g., Correia 2017; Fine 2001, 2015; Rosen 2015), others do not\n(e.g., Dorr 2016, King 1998). So here too, as a provisional matter we\nshall treat reductive explanation as distinct from (yet perhaps\nrelated to) both grounding and essentialist explanation and leave open\nwhether instances of the one imply instances of the other.\n\nWe are not suggesting that this list of varieties of metaphysical\nexplanation is comprehensive. For instance, consider:\n\n(7)\nSocrates has Sophroniscus as a father because he essentially has\nSophroniscus as a father.\n\n\nAlthough Glazier (2017) calls (7) an instance of essentialist\nexplanation, (7) appears to us to work in a different way than (3).\nUnlike (3), (7) does not attempt to explain what it is for\nSocrates to be the individual he is, or even what it is for\nSocrates to have Sophroniscus as a father. Rather, (7) concerns\nwhy Socrates has Sophroniscus as a father, and works by\nciting a certain fact about the status of this\nrelationship\u2014namely, that it is essential to\nSocrates\u2014which would presumably help to explain why Socrates\nmust be so. Glazier argues that explanations like (7) do not imply\ncorresponding grounding explanations, and thus explanations like (7)\nare not grounding explanations. Yet there is a more general pattern\nhere. Even if one is skeptical of the notion of essence, one might\nattempt to metaphysically explain why Socrates has Sophroniscus as a\nfather in terms of some other status of this fact; for instance, one\nmight appeal to the fact that it falls under a more general \u201claw\nof metaphysics\u201d, or one might simply appeal to the necessity of\nthis fact alone (see Kappes forthcoming).\n\nWe are also not suggesting that one must treat all of these (or other)\nforms of metaphysical explanation as genuine. Nonetheless, they are\nprevalent enough in both classic and contemporary metaphysics that an\naccount of metaphysical explanation that aims to be comprehensive\nought to either accommodate all of them or explain why they are not\ngenuine forms of metaphysical explanation despite initial\nappearances.\n3. Separatism vs. unionism about metaphysical explanation\n\nBefore, we said that metaphysical explanations \u201cderive their\nexplanatory power\u201d somehow from non-causal relationships. More\nspecific proposals about the nature and varieties of metaphysical\nexplanation diverge over which relationships those are, and how that\nwork is carried out. Any proposal, though, must confront perhaps the\nmost striking feature of any form of explanation, one that\nseems even more surprising in the case of metaphysical explanation.\nMetaphysical explanations seem to have one foot in the\nworld\u2014something to do with the way it is (causally or\nnon-causally) structured seems to play a role. Metaphysical\nexplanations are metaphysical, after all (or so one might\nthink). Yet they seem to have another foot in our thought and\ncommunication about the world\u2014our desire for explanation\n(even if not a natural one, as Aristotle claims) is at least in part a\ndesire to understand, to make the world intelligible\nto ourselves and others, to learn the why and how of things\nand what to expect, to satisfy our curiosity.\nMetaphysical explanations are explanations, after all (or so\none might think). Yet how could metaphysical explanation be at once\nmetaphysical, but also a form of explanation?\n\nFollowing Raven (2015), who applies the terminology to grounding and\ngrounding explanations in particular, approaches to this fundamental\nquestion might be classified with regard to whether they take a\n\u201cunionist\u201d or \u201cseparatist\u201d line. Standardly,\nunionism about grounding and grounding explanation is the\nthesis that they are one: to be grounded just is to be\nmetaphysically explained in a distinctive way (e.g., Dasgupta 2014;\nJenkins 2013; Litland 2013, 2017; Raven 2012; Rosen 2010; Thompson\n2016). (A unionist might also subscribe to the stronger thesis that\nthe expressions \u201cgrounded\u201d and \u201cexplained in\nsuch-and-such distinctive way\u201d are, or at least ought to be,\nused as synonyms, but that is not essential to how we understand the\nview here.) Unionists thus owe some account of how the metaphysical\nand explanatory elements of metaphysical explanation can be held\ntogether in a coherent package, or else jettison one element or the\nother. Separatism about grounding and grounding explanation\nis the thesis that they are separate, yet grounding explanations\nnonetheless \u201ctrack\u201d, or are \u201cbacked\u201d or\n\u201cunderwritten\u201d by, instances of grounding (e.g., Audi\n2012, Schaffer 2016, Trogdon 2013). Separatists thus owe some account\nof how that link keeps the metaphysical and explanatory elements of\nmetaphysical explanation from flying off in opposite directions. One\nmight think that the separatist about grounding explanation here\nincurs no new debt, since separatists about causal\nexplanation must meet an analogous challenge. However, note that the\nquasi-causal model of metaphysical explanation at play here is far\nfrom the only way in which we might model metaphysical explanation\n(see\n \u00a76),\n and also that to distinguish causation from causal explanation is\nitself a substantive commitment.\n\nIn order to extend the unionist-separatist classification to\nmetaphysical explanation in general, though, some care must\nbe taken. First (and most obviously), those who believe that there are\ntwo or more forms of metaphysical explanation need not be unionists or\nseparatists across the board. The extent to which one is a unionist or\na separatist should depend on what non-causal relations one takes\nstatements like (1)\u2013(4) to derive their explanatory power from,\nas well as on background assumptions about what kind of thing an\nexplanation is and what kinds of things it relates, or even whether\nthese statements ascribe relations at all on the final analysis. For\ninstance, we have spoken loosely of metaphysical explanations as\ntruths of a certain kind that can be discovered and argued\nover; one might take this view, and add to it the claim that they are\ntruths involving a relation between facts. Such a view might preclude\none from being a unionist about, say, essentialist explanations like\n(3), if one holds that they concern relationships that may involve\nthings that are not facts (e.g., Socrates and his father).\n\nSecond, a further complication is that there is an open question\nwhether the various non-causal relations by which metaphysical\nexplanations work must themselves \u201ctrack\u201d still\nfurther relations. For instance, one might maintain that instances of\ngrounding must somehow track the relations of whole to parts,\ndeterminable to determinate, role to realizer, set to members, or\nothers. Those with unionist sympathies must therefore be clear about\nwhether grounding explanations are to be identified with grounding or\nwith some non-causal relation that grounding tracks, while\nseparatists must be clear about whether grounding explanations work by\ntracking grounding, or by tracking some non-causal relation(s) that\ngrounding tracks. Similar points hold for essentialist and\nreductive explanations, if one holds the view that there are relations\nthat essence-accident and analysans-analysandum must\n\u201ctrack\u201d.\n\nFinally, there are viable approaches to metaphysical explanation that\ndo not fit neatly in either the unionist or separatist camp as it is\nstandardly understood. For instance, Maurin (2019) notes a distinction\nbetween those who believe that grounding is \u201cby its\nnature\u201d explanatory, as opposed to those who maintain that (at\nbest) grounding has certain other features that make it apt to back\ngrounding explanations. Interestingly, the former view (which counts\nas unionist on Maurin\u2019s classification) does not automatically\nimply that grounding be grounding explanation (which is\nrequired to count as unionist on Raven\u2019s classification). After\nall, knowledge is by its nature true, but it does not follow that\nknowledge is truth. Setting aside the less interesting question of how\none ought to use the term of art \u201cunionism\u201d,\nMaurin\u2019s proposal\u2014when broadened to metaphysical\nexplanation in general; see Thompson (2019)\u2014shows that there is\nconceptual space to distinguish the metaphysical and explanatory\nelements of metaphysical explanation yet without explicitly linking\nthem by appeal to a relation of backing.\n4. Monism vs pluralism about metaphysical explanation\n\nIn\n \u00a72,\n we canvassed some putatively different forms of metaphysical\nexplanation. But how many are there in fact? Monists about\nmetaphysical explanation think that there is just one, whereas\npluralists think that there are many. There are various different\nrespects in which one might be a monist or a pluralist. For example,\none might think that metaphysical explanations derive their\nexplanatory power from any of a number of non-causal dependence\nrelations (e.g., Thompson 2019), but that all metaphysical\nexplanations derive their explanatory power in the same way. This\nwould be a pluralism in one sense, because various kinds of relations\nproduce metaphysical explanations, but a monism in another because all\nmetaphysical explanations have the same form. A more monistic spin on\nsuch an account would hold that grounding relations produce\nmetaphysical explanations, but that there are various grounding\nmechanisms (e.g., Trogdon 2018). If the source of some metaphysical\nexplanations is relational but the source of others is to be found in\nthe essences of things, this is another version of this type of\n\u201clightweight\u201d pluralism.\n\nAccording to a more thoroughgoing pluralism, there are a number of\nfundamentally different kinds of metaphysical explanation. Such a view\ncan be motivated in a number of ways that do not at first glance\npresuppose particular views about whether relations of non-causal\ndependence like grounding, essence, and reduction reduce to one\nanother. Litland (2013) and Richardson (2020), for instance,\ndistinguish between how-explanation, which tells us\nhow or the specific way in which something is the\ncase and why-explanation, which tells us why it is\nthe case at all. Bertrand (2019) further recognizes a class of\nmetaphysical explanations by constraint:\n\u201ctop-down\u201d metaphysical explanations which show how\nparticular instances fit into a general scheme. These different kinds\nof explanation are plausibly elicited by the asking of different\nquestions.\n\nIn reply, the monist might deny that the asking of different kinds of\nquestions to elicit metaphysical explanations implies that we should\nbe pluralists. They might simply be different ways of asking for the\nsame kind of explanation, for example. Moreover, why-questions are\ngenerally taken to elicit causal explanations but can sometimes also\nbe used to elicit metaphysical explanations. One might then insist\nthat whilst differentiating kinds of explanation requests by the\nquestion asked can be a useful heuristic, it is not a perfectly\nreliable method for distinguishing different kinds of explanation.\n5. Realism vs antirealism about metaphysical explanation\n\nIn\n \u00a73,\n we raised a surprising tension in theorizing about metaphysical\nexplanation: at least initially, it appears at once to be about\nthe world (qua metaphysical) and about how we think and\ncommunicate about the world (qua explanation). Realists\nand antirealists about metaphysical explanation disagree\nabout how to resolve this tension. For realists, metaphysical\nexplanation is primarily (or even entirely) objective and\nmind-independent. That is, there is some mind-independent fact of the\nmatter about what metaphysically explains what; what metaphysically\nexplains what depends on what the world is like, and not (or at least\nnot primarily) on how we think or talk about it. Those who deny this,\nand think of metaphysical explanation as inescapably linked to how we\nthink and communicate, are antirealists.\n\nOne can be realists about metaphysical explanation to varying degrees.\nAn extreme realist view conjoins a realism about metaphysical\ndependence relations (they are themselves completely objective and\nmind-independent) with the view that metaphysical explanations\njust are the relevant kinds of dependence relations. Most\nphilosophers do not think metaphysical explanation is quite like this.\nAn attractive, widely held view is that metaphysical explanations have\nboth a representational component and a worldly component, as is\ncommonly the case when people adopt a version of the separatist view\ndiscussed above\n (\u00a73).\n So long as the worldly component of metaphysical explanation\n(generally taken to be a non-causal dependence relation of some sort)\nis itself objective and mind-independent, the relevant account of\nmetaphysical explanation is generally considered realist.\n\nHowever, there is room to adopt a view of metaphysical explanation\naccording to which constraints on how this worldly dependence relation\nand the relata it holds between are represented factor into whether or\nnot something counts as an explanation. For example, one might think\nthat an extremely complicated description of the relation between\nparticles could fail as a metaphysical explanation of the existence of\na table, because when related to subjects with our level of cognitive\nsophistication, it is impossible for us to understand or to expect the\nexistence of the table on the basis of the relevant description. This\nwould seem a less than fully realist account of metaphysical\nexplanation, because whilst the explanation includes a worldly\ncomponent, its counting as a metaphysical explanation or otherwise\ndepends on psychological factors such as the cognitive sophistication\nof its likely recipients.\n\nThere are various ways to resist the above account without giving up\non the idea that acts of metaphysical explanation might sometimes fail\non the basis of psychological factors. One might insist that a\nmetaphysical explanation is to be distinguished from an act\nof metaphysical explanation, and that all that is required for the\nlatter is a true representation of worldly non-causal dependence.\nMetaphysical explanations abound to various degrees of complexity\n(etc.) and their existing and counting as metaphysical explanations is\nnot something constrained by pragmatic, epistemic, or psychological\nfactors. How well they fare in acts of explaining is another matter,\none that falls under the question of whether or not they are\nsuccessful explanations. A different way to resist is to\ninsist that all that is required for realism is that one component of\nthe explanation be objective and mind-independent, because whilst the\nterm \u201cmetaphysical explanation\u201d refers to a representation\nof a worldly relation, whether something counts as a metaphysical\nexplanation or not fully depends on the worldly component. (One might\nmotivate this sort of view by claiming that, e.g., grounding is the\nessential component of any metaphysical explanation, but explanations\nare representational entities and so strictly speaking it is a mistake\nto describe the relation as an explanation, even though it alone does\nall the explanatory work, so to speak.)\n\nIn contrast, antirealists about metaphysical explanation at the most\nextreme end of the spectrum do not see any role for worldly dependence\nrelations (see, e.g., Dasgupta 2017 and Taylor forthcoming for\ndiscussion). They might adopt the two-component view discussed above\nand maintain that both the relation involved in metaphysical\nexplanation and how it is represented are conceptual matters (e.g.,\nbecause they are antirealists about the relevant non-casual dependence\nrelations), or they might think that metaphysical explanation has only\none component. That component might be a conceptual relation or a\nnon-causal dependence relation understood in an antirealist way, or it\nmight be something more representational. For example, one might\nfollow Shaheen (2017) in taking the use of causal metaphors to be a\ncomponent of our talk about metaphysical explanation, while going\nfurther than he does by denying that the metaphorical cause-like sense\nof \u201cbecause\u201d used in metaphysics has objective,\nmind-independent truth conditions. Or one might follow Thompson\n(2019), who thinks of metaphysical explanations as answers to certain\nkinds of questions. Both views are consistent with thinking that\nnon-causal dependence relations play a role in metaphysical\nexplanation (by being what certain kinds of because-claims are about,\nor helping to make it the case that a particular answer to a question\nis correct) but the relations are not themselves a component of the\nexplanation.\n\nNorton and Miller (2019) present what they describe as a\npsychologistic theory of metaphysical explanation; metaphysical\nexplanations have truth conditions that appeal to the dispositions of\nagents evaluating the explanation, as well as necessitation relations\nbetween the explanans and explanandum. Since these necessitation\nrelations are objective this is not an entirely antirealist account of\nmetaphysical explanation, but from the way in which mental states vary\nbetween individuals it follows that metaphysical explanations are only\ntrue or false relative to a particular context of assessment. It is\nthus to be considered a broadly antirealist account.\n6. Models of metaphysical explanation\n\nA common strategy when trying to get to a grip of some phenomenon is\nto model our understanding of its nature on some pre-existing and\nwell-established understanding of the nature of a (supposedly\nrelevantly similar) phenomenon. In this section we survey some\ninstances of this strategy by investigating attempts to model\nmetaphysical explanation as a kind of causal\n (\u00a76.1),\n nomological\n (\u00a76.2),\n unificationist\n (\u00a76.3),\n or pragmatist explanation\n (\u00a76.4).\n6.1 Metaphysical explanation as quasi-causal explanation\n\nThat metaphysical explanation is like causal explanation is a\nview with quite a few proponents today (though see Taylor 2018 for\nsome problem cases for this view). Mostly those who think it is, also\nthink that all or most metaphysical explanations track or are\ngrounding relations (see\n \u00a73\n above). According to these philosophers, more precisely, metaphysical\nexplanation is like causal explanation because grounding is like\ncausation (Fine 2012; Schaffer 2016, 2017; A. Wilson 2018). In what\nsense grounding is like causation varies among proponents of this\nview. According to Schaffer, grounding and causation, although similar\n(because both species of the kind directed determination\nrelation), are distinct. According to Wilson, grounding and what\nhe calls \u201cnomic causation\u201d are both kinds of causation\n(although of a rather different sort than ordinary causation; see\n \u00a72).\n On both accounts, metaphysical and causal explanation are alike\nbecause grounding and causation resemble each other. One might however\nthink that metaphysical explanation is like causal explanation simply\nbecause the relations those explanations track play the same\nrole vis-a-vis explanation. Fine (2012: 40) may be said to give\nexpression to something like this view when he states that:\n\u201cGround, if you like, stands to philosophy as cause stands to\nscience\u201d. Holding this view is compatible with the relations\nthose explanations pick out being in all other respects different from\none another.\n\nIf grounding is, or is like, causation, what follows concerning our\nunderstanding of the nature of metaphysical explanation? That\ndepends. One suggestion is that, if grounding is (like) causation, how\nwe understand the nature of causation (and grounding) somehow directly\ntranslates into an account of the nature of causal (and metaphysical)\nexplanation. Some accounts of the nature of causation seem a better\nfit than others for this type of \u201ctranslation\u201d. If, for\ninstance, causation is understood along counterfactual or\ninterventionist lines, causation and causal explanation (and, is the\nidea, by analogy, grounding and metaphysical explanation) seem\nespecially closely related (see the entry on\n causation: and manipulability\n and the entry on\n counterfactual theories of causation).\n On this type of account, a causal explanation amounts to laying bare\nsystematic patterns of counterfactual dependence. In interventionist\nlanguage:\n\n\n[T]he common element in many forms of explanation, both causal and\nnon-causal, is that they must answer what-if-things-had-been-different\nquestions. (Woodward 2003: 221)\n\n\nSchaffer (2016) proposes we model grounding \u201cin the image of\ncausation\u201d along counterfactual lines (see A. Wilson 2018, who\noffers a similar model). More precisely, he suggests we understand\ngrounding via so-called structural equation models. These are\nmodels which can be characterized using a structure (introduced by\nHalpern 2000) featuring a set of exogenous (independent) variables, a\nset of endogenous (dependent) variables, a set of (incompatible)\nvalues representing contrasts (such that there is a function mapping\nevery variable to an at least two-membered set of values), a set of\nstructural equations (telling us how each endogenous variable is to be\nevaluated on the basis of the values of other variables), and some\nassignment of values to each exogenous variable. Schaffer thinks this\nformalism is excellent for modeling directed dependency relations\ngenerally, and so is equally fitting for modeling both causal and\nmetaphysical dependencies. All that needs adjusting when we move from\ncausation to grounding is some of our background understanding of\nsurrounding notions.\n\nSchaffer is a separatist (see\n \u00a73).\n Causal and metaphysical explanation are in other words distinct from\nthe relations (causation and grounding, respectively) they track, and\nit is important not to think that everything that is true about the\nexplanation side of things must be true of the relation side of things\n(and vice versa). Schaffer does draw one rather\nsubstantive conclusion from the analogy between causation and\ngrounding, however: that there is no distinctive notion of\nmetaphysical (as opposed to causal) explanation. There is\njust explanation (simpliciter) and explanation can be backed by\ncausation, grounding or whatever other relations are apt to back\nexplanation (which, on his view, is the same as being apt to be\nmodeled using structural equations). Similarly, A. Wilson (2018)\nthinks that a \u201cmajor theoretical benefit\u201d of regarding\ngrounding as metaphysical causation is that this accounts, in a\nstraightforward way, for the explanatory nature of grounding claims:\ngrounding explanations are a type of causal explanation, and they work\nby identifying metaphysical causes. The result is a unified theory of\nexplanation, at least of explanations that work by tracking some\nworldly relation (see\n \u00a74),\n according to which all explanation is causal explanation.\n\nAgainst the account, a couple of things can and have been said. First,\njust as there are important analogies between grounding and causation\n(of the ordinary, run-of-the mill sort:\n \u00a71),\n there are disanalogies as well. This is accepted by both\nfriends and foes of the view. The question then is whether those\ndifferences are serious enough to undermine the work the analogy does\nin the account (proponents of the account, not surprisingly\ndon\u2019t think so; for some who do: see, e.g., Bernstein 2016,\nJanssen 2018, and Roski 2021; see Ylikoski 2013 for a related view).\nAnother argument (due to Janssen 2018) against understanding\ngrounding, and hence metaphysical explanation, in terms of structural\nequation models points to the representational status of models\ngenerally. Deciding whether or not a causal model includes the right\nvariables (both in number and kind) to be able to represent the causal\nstructure of interest sometimes involves reference to what is\nconsidered the theory that best captures the actual features of\nparticular (local) causal processes or mechanisms. These are typically\ntheories for which we have a posteriori evidence. Yet in the\ncase of grounding, these sorts of \u201cevidence\u201d for\nmodel-aptness are not available. In fact, it is not even enough for\nthe grounding theorist to include all possible scenarios, it\nseems the grounding theorist must countenance\ncounterpossibles as well. That this is so, is admitted and\ndefended in A. Wilson (2018). For those who think this is\nunacceptable, however, this is a serious problem with the account.\n\nAnother way of exploiting the analogy between grounding and causation\nis by modeling metaphysical explanation on so-called\ncausal-mechanistic explanation via modeling grounding on causation,\nmechanistically understood (see the entry on\n mechanism in science).\n Something along these lines is suggested in Trogdon (2018). On this\nview:\n\n\nsome metaphysical explanations are representations of grounding\nrelations as being instances of grounding mechanisms. (Trogdon 2018:\n1296)\n\n\nThe explanandum of a grounding-mechanical explanation is the obtaining\nof a grounded fact, and just as we can causally explain a phenomenon\nby providing a model of the inner workings of the mechanism that\nproduces it (see Machamer et al. 2000), we can metaphysically explain\nwhy a grounded fact obtains by providing a model of how grounding\nfacts and facts they ground are connected. We explain why a\ngrounded fact obtains by revealing the metaphysical determination\nrelations\u2014examples, provided by Trogdon, include set formation,\nthe determinate-determinable relation, functional realization,\nconstitution and mereological realization\u2014that hold between the\nconstituents of the relevant facts. In other words: we explain\nwhy a fact obtains via accounting for how it is\n(mechanistically) grounded.\n\nCan all metaphysical explanations be understood in\nquasi-causal terms? Those who want to argue that they can have their\nwork cut out for them. They first need to explain how explanations\nlike our (3) and (4) can be modeled in this way. Perhaps more\nsurprisingly, some argue that this sort of account might not even work\nas an account of all types of metaphysical explanation involving\ngrounding. It is generally thought that a conjunctive fact is grounded\nin its conjuncts. Yet, unless we think of conjunction-introduction as\na (mechanistic) determination relation\u2014something Trogdon\ncautions strongly against (and others: see, e.g., Wilsch\n2015)\u2014this is grounding in the absence of a grounding\nmechanism.\n\nIf it follows that conceptual or logical metaphysical explanations\nwork in a different way than other types of (grounding) metaphysical\nexplanation, then the unification gained by modeling metaphysical as\ncausal explanation is arguably contradicted by the\ndisunification of metaphysical explanations of the\ngrounding-kind. If you think this is a problem, there are a couple of\ndifferent options available: you may, first, claim that, although\ncases of \u201cbare\u201d grounding are bare in the sense that they\ndo not involve any grounding-mechanisms, they are not bare in\nthe sense that they involve no mechanism whatsoever. They do,\nonly the mechanisms they involve are not grounding\nmechanisms, but rather conceptual or logical\nmechanisms: mechanisms involving the conceptual and/or logical\nanalogue of the grounding determination relations. Another option is\nto try to redraw the boundaries for what counts as a\nmetaphysical explanation and argue that cases of bare\ngrounding do not back metaphysical but rather other types\nof\u2014conceptual or logical\u2014explanation (e.g., Kovacs 2017;\nMcSweeney 2020). This frees the proponent of the mechanistic view from\nhaving to introduce different kinds of mechanisms but does not really\nsolve the problem of disunification. Alternatively, the proponent of\nthe mechanistic view could argue that, while there is metaphysical\nexplanation in cases of bare grounding, those are cases where\ngrounding doesn\u2019t play an essential role in the explanation\n(grounding doesn\u2019t back metaphysical explanation). The result\nwould be an account of metaphysical explanation able to provide us\nwith a unified account only of such explanations which\nessentially involve grounding. In view of the fact that many\nbelieve that conceptual and logical explanation, for example, need to\nbe separately accounted for anyway, this should perhaps be\nacceptable.\n\nThus, even if there is this interesting sense in which we can unify\nquasi-casual metaphysical explanations and causal scientific\nexplanations, it is not clear whether all metaphysical explanation are\nof this form, since at least on first glance there seem to be\nexceptions\u2014sometimes major exceptions\u2014that fail to be\ncovered by this model. Whether this is considered a problem or not\nwill depend on whether or not one thinks there is a special value in\nmonism with respect to one\u2019s account of metaphysical\nexplanation, and to what extent one takes putative examples that do\nnot fit the mold are genuine.\n6.2 Metaphysical Explanation as nomological explanation\n\nSome have argued that metaphysical explanation ought to be understood\nas a species of the kind deductive-nomological explanation. On this\nview (see Hempel & Oppenheim 1948 and Hempel 1965) (scientific)\nexplanations are sound deductive arguments, featuring the following\ningredients (see\n scientific explanation, \u00a72):\n\nAn initial condition: An event of type F\nobtains.\nA law statement: For all events, if an event of type\nF obtains, then an event of type G obtains.\nA conclusion: An event of type G obtains.\n\n\nThis way of understanding the nature of (scientific) explanation does\nnot mention causation and is compatible with a Humean understanding of\nlaws of nature, for example one that takes laws of nature to be truths\nthat belong to any deductive system that best balances simplicity and\nfit with the facts. In this sense, understanding explanation in\ndeductive-nomological terms can easily be combined with an antirealism\nabout such explanations, if the notions of best balance, simplicity,\nand/or fit with the facts are understood partly in terms of how we\nthink or communicate (see\n \u00a75).\n Or the account can be understood as realist in nature, if, for\nexample, one\u2019s preferred account of the nature of laws of nature\nis in turn realist (those proposed by Armstrong 1983, Dretske 1977,\nand Tooley 1977 being one example).\n\nMost of those who have argued that metaphysical explanation is\ndeductive-nomological have tended to defend a comparatively\n\u201cheavyweight\u201d account of the (metaphysical) laws that\nmetaphysical explanations involve, and so have opted for a realist\nseparatist version of the account. Laws, on this view, are understood\nas something more or other than the Humean regularities they entail,\nand in at least some cases involve or reduce to facts about an\nunderlying \u201cconstruction\u201d relation or essence (e.g.,\nGlazier 2016; Kment 2014; Wilsch 2015). For more on the nature of\n\u201claws of metaphysics\u201d, see, e.g., Sider (2011: sect. 12.4)\nand Rosen (2006; 2017). For a comparatively speaking less heavyweight\naccount of the nature of the laws that feature in metaphysical\nexplanation\u2014one according to which such laws are nothing but\n\u201ccounterfactual-supporting general principles\u201d and\ntherefore \u201cinclusive\u201d in the sense of being neither\nnecessarily fundamental nor necessarily exceptionless\u2014see\nSchaffer (2017). See also Woodward and Hitchcock (2003).\n\nAdopting a more heavyweight account of the nature of metaphysical\nlaws, and hence of metaphysical explanation, may come with a\nmetaphysical cost\u2014for instance, if one takes them to be\nontologically basic entities, or if one takes the distinction between\nlaws and non-laws to be a primitive one. According to proponents of\nsuch an account, this is a price worth paying. One important reason\nwhy the traditional deductive-nomological account of (scientific)\nexplanation has few proponents today was that the symmetry of\ndeductive entailment in certain cases seemed to interfere with our\nintuitions about the asymmetry of explanation (e.g., Lehrer 1974, who\ngets the example from Bromberger\u2019s (1966) famous flagpole/shadow\nexample, see also the entry\n scientific explanation \u00a72.5).\n If the laws that explanation invokes involve or even reduce to\nsomething which has direction (from more to less fundamental) already\nbuilt in, this problem is entirely avoided. Of course, if the account\nis to be able to also cover metaphysical explanation in the sense of\nessentialist explanation (see\n \u00a72\n above), the fact that the laws have direction already built in could\nbe considered a flaw rather than an advantage.\n\nFinally, if metaphysical explanation is deductive-nomological (or\n\u201ccovering law\u201d), it seems that there is no room for\nexplanations of rare or one-off phenomena in terms of the mechanisms\nthat ground (or cause) them, even in cases where, had a similar\nmechanism occurred, it need not have given rise to a similar\nphenomenon (e.g., Taylor 2016). According to Trogdon (2018; see also\nAnscombe 1971), it seems likely that some explanations are\none-off in this sense, from which it would seem to follow that, even\nif some or most metaphysical explanations turn out to be deductive\nnomological, this cannot be true of all of them. For an argument\nagainst this conclusion\u2014on the grounds that laws of metaphysics\ncan be indeterministic and that (like indeterministic laws of nature)\nthey can hence help explain rare events\u2014see Wasserman\n(2017).\n6.3 Metaphysical explanation as explanation by unification\n\nUnificationism is a view of scientific explanation that, although it\nbuilds on some of the insights of the classic DN-model, extends and\nrefines that model by focusing, not on individual arguments, but on\nthose argument patterns which best unify the relevant phenomena. Its\ncore idea is that to explain is to derive as many conclusions as\npossible from as few premises as possible, using as few and as\nstringent argument patterns as possible. The fewer patterns used, the\nhigher the stringency. The greater the range of conclusions derived,\nthe greater the unification. The account (inspired by Friedman 1974)\nwas first developed by Kitcher (1981, 1989). For a good overview, see\nthe entry on\n scientific explanation (\u00a75).\n\nIn metaphysics, an account of explanation along something like these\nlines can (as noted by Roski 2019) be found already in the work of\nBolzano. Recent attempts to adapt Kitcher\u2019s model to suit\nmetaphysical and not just scientific explanation include Kovacs (2020)\nand Baron & Norton (2021) (see Bertrand 2019 for an account that,\nalthough not couched in terms of unification, has a lot in common with\ntheir views).\n\nA unificationist account of metaphysical explanation is an account\naccording to which such explanations aim to unify the beliefs\nimplicated in metaphysical theorizing. On this view, roughly speaking,\na particular derivation is a metaphysical explanation just in case it\nis an instance of an argument pattern that unifies metaphysical\nbeliefs. Several things can be said in favor of this view. If you are\nno fan of grounding, the fact that it takes metaphysical explanation\nto be something completely independent of whatever determinative\n(grounding) relations there happen to be (or not), will count as a big\npoint in its favor. Another positive is the fact that it is an account\nof metaphysical explanation that makes unusually good sense of the\nlink between explanation and understanding. Unificationism corresponds\nto an intuitive way of thinking about understanding: we understand\nbetter when we can derive large amounts of information from a fairly\nsmall number of premises and a small number of argument patterns. This\nis because the ability to do so suggests an ability to identify\nconnections between things; to fit things together. Yet the resulting\naccount is not (just) psychological. As Friedman points out,\nexplanatoriness remains in an important sense objective if \u201cwhat\nis scientifically comprehensible is constant for a relatively large\nclass of people\u201d (1974: 7\u20138).\n\nFor those who think of metaphysical explanation as an entirely\nobjective and worldly affair the account will however remain highly\nunattractive. Indeed, even those who think of metaphysical explanation\nas partly representational\u2014the so-called separatists\u2014will\nmost likely not find it very appealing. Note, though, that some think\nthat metaphysical explanation can be either unificationist or\nunderstood in terms of grounding (Bertrand 2019 is one example). If\nso, although metaphysical explanation will become a less unified\nphenomenon, the fact that it can make sense of both what Bertrand\n(inspired by Salmon 2006) calls \u201ctop-down\u201d and\n\u201cbottom-up\u201d metaphysical explanation, should perhaps count\nas a point in its favor.\n\nSome further objections to the account\u2014including, among other\nthings, the question of what should count as the best\nsystematization; if understanding metaphysical explanation in\nunificationist terms means having to give up on the \u201cimpure\nlogic\u201d of such explanations, and; if given unificationism,\nlogical truths will lack metaphysical explanation\u2014are discussed\n(and ultimately rejected) in Kovacs (2020). A classic objection to the\nunificationist account of causal explanation, finally, is that it,\njust like its close cousin the DN-account (see\n \u00a76.2),\n fails to make sense of the asymmetry of such explanations, at least\nnot without assuming causal realism. A similar objection may well be\navailable to those who combine unificationism and anti-realism about\nmetaphysical explanation. \n6.4 The pragmatics of metaphysical explanation\n\nPragmatic accounts of metaphysical explanation hold that whether\nsomething counts as an explanation or not is context-dependent. This\ngoes deeper than thinking that explanatory information is\ncontext-dependent; that there are pragmatic constraints on how much,\nhow little, or what kind of explanatory information to request or give\nin a particular conversation is fairly widely accepted. It also goes\ndeeper than noting that which relation the term \u201cexplains\u201d\npicks out differs from context of utterance to context of utterance\n(since, perhaps, one takes the term \u201cunderstands\u201d to be\ncontext-sensitive in this way, and one takes the conferral of\nunderstanding to be necessary to explanation). The thesis is rather\nthe far more controversial one that metaphysical explanation is\nitself a context-sensitive phenomenon in the sense that the\nfactors relevant to evaluating the truth of a statement of\nmetaphysical explanation, once the context of utterance has settled\nthat statement's truth-conditions, involve facts about actual or\npossible (types of) explanation givers or receivers, such as facts\nabout their interests, conceptual proficiencies, background knowledge,\nand the like.\n\nIn the literature on causal explanation, the most famous proponent of\npragmatic explanation is van Fraassen (1980) who argues that\nexplanations are answers to why-questions. A fairly straightforward\nanalogue for metaphysical explanation would be to hold that\nmetaphysical explanations are answers to what-makes-it-the-case-that\nquestions. There are then various different ways in which aspects of\ncontext become salient. First, the context might focus the question.\nWhen we ask \u201cWhat makes it the case that the ball is\nred?\u201d, we will expect different answers depending on the\ncontrast class we had in mind (e.g., red rather than some other color,\nor red rather than merely appearing to be red). Second, the context\nalso determines the kinds of answers that are acceptable, which might\ndiffer based on (for example) the background knowledge of the\nexplanation-seeker and explanation-receiver. An artist will typically\nhave a far more finely-grained conception of what particular shade\nmakes a certain Rothko painting red than your average schoolchild\nwould, and so a particular answer might count as explanatory for the\nartist but not for a child (who may not even possess the relevant\ncolor concept).\n\nThere has, as of yet, been comparatively little discussion of\npragmatic accounts of metaphysical explanation in the literature. One\nexception is Thompson (2019), who develops an account along the lines\ndescribed above, where metaphysical explanations are pairs of\ncontext-sensitive questions and answers. Because the role of context\nis ineliminable, there is no sense to be made of a notion of\nmetaphysical explanation free from pragmatic constraints. However,\nThompson accounts for the correctness of particular explanations (in\npart) by appeal to worldly dependence relations, and so that\nmetaphysical explanation is pragmatic does not imply that it is wholly\nunconstrained by worldly dependence. A different kind of pragmatic\ntheory of metaphysical explanation is defended by Miller and Norton\n(2017). Their \u201cpsychologistic\u201d account of metaphysical\nexplanation locates the truth conditions for metaphysically\nexplanatory claims in the psychological states of the agents\nevaluating the relevant \u201cbecause\u201d claims, alongside\nworldly necessitation relations. The relevant psychological states are\ndispositions towards particular beliefs, which are expected to vary\nbetween individuals. Claims about what metaphysically explains what\nare thus only true relative to a specific (type of) context within\nwhich the claim's truth is being assessed.\n7. The scope of metaphysical explanation\n7.1 Metaphysical explanation outside of metaphysics\n\nThus far, we have discussed the nature of metaphysical\nexplanation, but have kept silent on what its extent might\nbe. At first glance, facts of all sorts inside metaphysics and out\nseem to at least in principle admit of metaphysical explanation. In\nthis section, we discuss recent applications in ethics, philosophy of\nmind, and philosophy of social science respectively.\n\nFirst, ethics. In Plato\u2019s Euthyphro, the eponymous\nEuthyphro is asked by Socrates to consider the following question: Is\nthat which is pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it\npious because it is loved by the gods? (Euthyphro 10a). This\nis a very early example of a request for a metaphysical explanation,\nfor the connection between piety and being loved by the gods imagined\nin the second horn does not seem to be a causal connection, but a\nconstitutive one (although what Plato means by \u201cbecause\u201d\nin the first horn, and the overall structure of Plato\u2019s\nargument, remains controversial). Requests for explanation abound in\nmoral philosophy: one of the key aims of first-order moral philosophy\nis to explain why the right actions are right and the wrong\nones are wrong (Fogal & Risberg 2020), and of metaethics is to\nsystematize those explanations. Fine (2012: 37) distinguishes between\nthree different explanatory relations: metaphysical, normative, and\nnatural, apparently suggesting that normative explanations and\nmetaphysical explanations are different kinds of explanation. However,\nexplanations in the moral realm (e.g., that an action is bad because\nit causes pain, or that something has intrinsic value just in case it\nis valuable in virtue of its intrinsic properties) are often\nconsidered paradigm cases of metaphysical explanations. Berker (2018),\nwho is a unionist, argues at length that it is metaphysical grounding\n(and thus metaphysical explanation) that is at issue in moral\nphilosophy.\n\nSecond, philosophy of mind. Although there has been limited systematic\ndiscussion of metaphysical explanation in the area, considerations\nabout metaphysical explanation inform some of the most fundamental\nquestions in the discipline, such as how it could be the case that\nconsciousness exists. It is fairly common for the grounding literature\nto mention by way of elucidation of the notion of grounding that we\nmight think of mental facts as grounded in the physical facts. This\nexample is supposed to be compelling because of the attractiveness of\nthe idea that physical facts determine and metaphysically explain the\nmental facts, and grounding is a prima facie appealing notion\nwith which to characterize the relationship between the mental and the\nphysical precisely because of its explanatory nature. This idea is\nmade more precise in the development of grounding physicalism\n(see, e.g., Ney 2016; O\u2019Conaill 2018; Rabin forthcoming-a,\nforthcoming-b; Schaffer 2021), though this new version of physicalism\nhas not been met with universal approval (see, e.g., Melnyk 2016; J.\nWilson 2018).\n\nFor physicalists in the philosophy of mind who maintain that the\nmental is grounded in, supervenient on, or identical with the\nphysical, there is a pressing need to explain what makes it the case\nthat some particular phenomenal feel should be associated with a given\nphysical state (see, e.g., Chalmers 1996; Levine 2001). This\nexplanatory gap is an epistemic one, and so there are two ways we\nmight proceed. The first is to insist that unless the explanatory gap\nhas been closed, we do not have a metaphysical explanation of the\nmental in terms of the physical. The second is to allow that we might\nhave a metaphysical explanation without a corresponding epistemic one.\nSchaffer (2017) argues that grounding, and the metaphysical laws that\nprovide the framework for grounding, close the explanatory gap between\nthe mental and the physical (and many more besides). Rabin (2019)\ndisagrees, claiming that the gap between consciousness and physical\nfundamentalia has a special status, persisting even if we grant that\nthe former is metaphysically explained by the latter.\n\nThird, philosophy of social science. Theorizing about the nature of\nsocial reality at least partly involves metaphysically explaining\nsocial reality. Debates between (methodological) holists and\nindividualists, for example, concern whether social activities and\nevents are to be explained by appeal to macro-level (social)\nphenomena, or by the thoughts and actions of the individuals that,\nmost agree, make up or ground those social phenomena (see, e.g.,\nPopper 1945; Watkins 1952). The metaphysically explanatory nature of\nsocial theorizing has not always been appreciated. This is brought out\nin the distinction between explanatory and ontological individualism\n(Lukes 1968). Explanatory individualism is the thesis that social\nreality is best explained in terms of individuals, their thoughts and\ninteractions. Ontological individualism, on the other hand, holds that\nsocial reality consists in or is exhaustively determined by\nindividuals, their thoughts and interactions. If, however, social\nreality is or is grounded in individuals and their interactions,\nsocial reality is metaphysically explained by those individuals and\ntheir interactions (Epstein 2015). Both these theses are theses about\nexplanation.\n\nMetaphysical explanation is also relevant when considering the\nexistence and nature of social kinds. According to Haslanger (2012),\nfor example, being a woman amounts to occupying a certain (subordinate\nand hence oppressed) position in a social hierarchy. This type of view\ngives rise to Euthyphro-like queries of the kind: is x a\nwoman because she occupies a certain position in an oppressive\nstructure, or does she occupy this position because she is a woman?\n(see \u00c1sta 2010). According to some philosophers involved in\nthis debate, how you answer this question will decide if your account\nis realist (Barnes 2017) or deflationist (D\u00edaz-Le\u00f3n\n2018). Haslanger herself has argued that the account is best\nunderstood as something in between. Against the\n\u201cdeflationists\u201d, she is an extensionalist about meaning,\nfrom which it follows that it would make no sense to say that we have\nto sort out what the word means before determining its extension.\nAgainst the realists, Haslanger sometimes talks as if she rejects the\nidea that reality is hierarchically structured and holds instead that\nthe natural world is neither explanatorily prior to nor ontologically\nmore fundamental than the social world (pace, e.g., Schaffer\n2017).\n7.2 Do all facts admit of metaphysical explanation, or none?\n\nAbstracting from specific putative applications of metaphysical\nexplanation outside of metaphysics proper, can one say in more general\nterms what the extent of metaphysical explanation is? On one extreme,\nproponents of the famous\n \u201cprinciple of sufficient reason\u201d\n contend that everything (or\neverything of a certain sort, e.g., contingent facts) has an\nexplanation of some form or other, and Dasgupta (2016) has prominently\ndeveloped a version of the principle regarding metaphysical\nexplanation, specifically grounding explanation on his view.\nNotably, Dasgupta distinguishes between two ways that metaphysical\nexplanation might be limited in extent. Call a substantive\nfact one that is \u201capt for being grounded\u201d, in the sense\nthat\n\n\nthe question of what grounds it can legitimately be raised and admits\nof a sensible answer (an answer that either states its ground or else\nstates that it has none),\n\n\nand call a fact autonomous just in case it is not\nsubstantive, and thus is one for which \u201cthe question of why it\nobtains does not legitimately arise\u201d (2016: 383).\nDasgupta\u2019s version of the PSR is then the claim that\n\u201cevery substantive fact has an autonomous ground\u201d\n(2016: 84).\n\nBroadening Dasgupta\u2019s distinction, there are two questions about\nthe scope of metaphysical explanation to consider. First, which (types\nof) facts have metaphysical explanations\u2014all, none, or something\nin the middle? Second, of those that lack metaphysical explanations,\nwhich (types of) facts are not apt to be metaphysically explained at\nall? Dasgupta suggests that facts about essence are autonomous facts\n(2016: 385). Other philosophers have challenged the idea that facts\nabout essences are ungrounded, and so have opened the door to facts\nregarding essences having metaphysical explanations (see Tillman 2016,\nGlazier 2017, Raven 2021).\n\nOn the other extreme, one might maintain that no fact is apt to be\nmetaphysically explained. One type of worry is that notions thought by\nsome to be constitutive of metaphysical explanation, such as grounding\nand essence, are somehow defective (see the entry on\n metaphysical grounding \u00a78\n and the entry on\n essential vs. accidental properties \u00a75).\n Another type of worry is that metaphysical explanations would compete\nwith scientific, mathematical, and/or other forms of explanation in a\nmanner that render metaphysical explanations objectionably\nsuperfluous. Jeff Engelhardt (2016) develops this line of thought and\nargues that many philosophers are implicitly committed to an\nobjectionable sort of overdetermination involving metaphysical\nexplanation. The sort of overdetermination he has in mind regards\ncases where something seems to have a sufficient causal explanation as\nwell as a sufficient metaphysical explanation. For example, for any\ngiven house, that house exists both because it was caused to exist\n(causal explanation), as well as because it is grounded in its parts\n(metaphysical explanation). Perhaps the best solution to the problem\nwhich we can come up with, Engelhardt suggests, is that in cases such\nas this one the cause in question (C) causes the grounds of\nthe house to obtain, but C does not cause the house to exist.\nIn this case, while C does explain why the house exists, it\ndoes not causally explain why the house exists. Rather,\nC causally explains why the parts of the house are configured\nin such-and-such a manner, and those parts being configured in that\nmanner in turn grounds the existence of the house.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aizawa, Kenneth and Carl Gillett (eds.), 2016, <em>Scientific\nComposition and Metaphysical Ground</em>, London: Palgrave Macmillan\nUK. doi:10.1057/978-1-137-56216-6", "Anscombe, G.
