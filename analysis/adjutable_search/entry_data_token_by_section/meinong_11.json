A founding\nobject is an inferius, as it is in some way inferior and also\nprior to the founded object, that is, an inferius is of lower order\nwith respect to its superior object. Such a superius is,\ntherefore, coined an object of higher order (1899,\n\u00a7\u00a72\u20137). Objects of higher order presuppose founding\nobjects; you can also say that the superius supervenes on its\ninferiora. In the case of four nuts that form a plane square one can\nstate \u201cThere are four nuts on the floor\u201d, but one can also\nstate that there is a square of nuts over there, i.e., the nuts form a\nsquare. The nuts are the founding objects, the inferiora, and the\nfounded higher object (the superius) is the square of nuts (1910,\n\u00a7\u00a74, 6). Another example is given by the combination of the\nfollowing tokens \u201c:\u2013)\u201d or by a\ncircle with three points and a round line \u2014 they make a face\npicture, a smiley. Meinong is a kind of ontological atomist as he\nthinks that there are objects of lowest order \u2014 objects which\ncannot be objects of higher order. These genuinely simple objects are\ncalled infima (1921a, Sect. 2B: 105). Although objects of\nhigher order are based on infima they are not reducible to them;\nproperties of superiora supervene on properties of their inferiora.\nInfima can be presented only by the mental act of an elementary\nrepresentation, while objects of higher order can be presented by\nrepresentations (gained by the production of representation; see above\n4.3.3) and by other mental acts as well. In Meinong\u2019s later\nwork, objects of higher order are complexes (comprising mere\ncollections as a borderline case), relations, and the aforementioned\nobjects of mental acts, namely objectives, dignitatives and\ndesideratives (1917, \u00a711). Every object of higher order includes\nits constituents and a relation which combines them in a specific way.\nNot all objects of higher order have mereological parts. The objective\n\u201cThe round square does not exist\u201d has being (subsists),\nalthough its constituent \u201cthe round square\u201d is a beingless\nobject. According to Meinong\u2019s examples of existing things, real\nobjects of higher order may also exist (an experience or a house, for\nexample), but the number of stones and the (dis-)similarities between\nthe stones of an existing house do not exist; they only subsist and\nare of ideal character (1899, \u00a76; 1978: 252).\n\nMeinong\u2019s conception of objects of higher order was strongly\ninfluenced by Christian von Ehrenfels\u2019 Gestalt theory (Ehrenfels\n1890). Despite some differences, there are significant similarities\nbetween Meinong\u2019s objects of higher order and Ehrenfels\u2019\nGestalt qualities (1891; 1899; cf. Smith 1994, Chapt. 8).\n",
