    "main_text": "Philosophy of Mathematics, Theory of Probability and Statistics\n4. Philosophy of Mathematics, Theory of Probability and Statistics\n\n Jevons' principles of number reflect his insistence that\nmathematics should be based on logic, not the other way round. He\noccupies a somewhat contradictory position in the history of logic,\nsince his formalism was inspired by the works of Boole, who gave\nmathematics priority over logic. Jevons attempts to define\n\u2018number\u2019 by counting \u2018units\u2019 in space or\ntime. When counting coins, every coin should receive a proper name: we\nshould count C\u2032 + C\u2033 +\nC\u2032\u2032\u2032 +\nC\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 + \u2026  The coins are\nequal to each other (they all belong to the class C); they\nare different only because they reside on different points in\nspace. Before counting, we should reduce all identical alternatives;\nthe remaining \u2018units\u2019 reside on different points in space\nand time.  \u201cA unit is any object of thought which can be\ndiscriminated from every other object treated as a unit in the same\nproblem\u201d (Jevons 1874: 157). The concept of\n\u2018unit\u2019 encounters some severe difficulties, as noted by\nFrege. We can only add up Cs that are identical, but they\ncannot denote different things if the same symbol C is\nused. Jevons was unable to resolve this contradiction.\n\n Given these problems, the role and importance of Jevons' system\nof logic and philosophy of mathematics seems to be small. It\nappears to be limited to a pedagogical aspect: Jevons' writings\non logic, such as his Elementary Lessons in Logic, were widely\nused as textbooks and saw numerous reprints, up to decades after his\ndeath. This appraisal would not, however, do justice to\nJevons' most important achievement: the introduction of\nstatistics and econometrics in the social sciences and the use of\nempirical data.\n\n Statisticians in the first part of the 19th century were concerned\nwith the collection of data, but not with analysis. The data suggested\ntoo many different causes. Statistical journals published tables and\nnumbers, but graphical representations and analysis remained\nabsent. In 1863 Jevons published A Serious Fall in the Value of\nGold, which investigated the influence of Australian and\nCalifornian gold discoveries of 1851 on the value of gold. For this\npurpose he constructed index numbers making use of the geometric\nmean. He argued that multiplicative disturbances will be balanced off\nagainst each other when using the geometric mean. There is however no\nempirical verification of this \u2018multiplicative\ndisturbances\u2019 hypothesis. Aldrich (1987) argues that Jevons used\nprobability in two main patterns of argument: in the determination\nwhether events result from certain causes or are rather coincidences,\nand in the method of the least squares. The first approach entails the\napplication of the \u2018inverse method\u2019 in induction: if many\nobservations suggest regularity, then it becomes highly improbable\nthat these result from mere coincidence.   The second\napproach, the method of the least squares, appears when Jevons tries\nto adjudge weights to commodities (giving more weight to commodities\nthat are less vulnerable to price fluctuations), and when he tries to\nfit empirical laws starting from an a priori reasoning about the form\nof the equation. These methods show at least some concern for\nprobability and the theory of errors.   But Jevons worked on\nthe limits of his mathematical understanding, and many ideas that he\nforeshadowed were not developed until decades after his death.\n\n Jevons' use of statistics in the social sciences was inspired by\nAdolphe Quetelet. Jevons distinguishes between a\n\u2018mean\u2019 (the approximation of a definite existing quantity)\nand an \u2018average\u2019 or \u2018fictitious mean\u2019 (an\narithmetical average). The fictitious mean is important, since it\nallows us to \u2018conceive in a single result a multitude of\ndetails\u2019. For instance, Jevons equates aggregate and\naverage consumption: provided that the community under consideration is\nlarge enough, the average consumption of the aggregate community will\nvary continuously due to price changes, whereas individual behaviour is\nstrongly affected by accidents. If all individuals had exactly\nthe same features (those relevant for consumption), then the average\nlaws of supply and demand would be equal to the conduct of every\nindividual. If however the \u201cpowers, wants, habits, and\npossessions\u201d of different people were widely different, then the\naverage would not represent \u201cthe character of any existing\nthing\u201d. The accidents would cancel each other out and a\ncertain \u2018typical\u2019 consumer would emerge. Although\nthis is clearly a case of a fictitious mean, it would not be less\nuseful: \u201cthe movements of trade and industry depend upon averages\nand aggregates, not upon the whim of individuals\u201d.\n\n Jevons thus recognizes that people are not homogeneous and that it\nwould be wrong to create \u2018representative agents\u2019 depicting\nindividual behaviour. In the case of large aggregates however,\ndisturbing causes would cancel each other out. Here Jevons brings\nin the large number argument. If however specific policy\nquestions are at stake, the heterogeneity of different societal\nsubgroups has to be accounted for. Jevons uses the concept of\n\u2018character\u2019 in order to bridge the gap between universal\ntheory and characteristics of specific subgroups in society, as we will\nsee in the next section.\n",
