Working class mobilization tilts toward the redistribution end\nof the spectrum, and claims for exemption from generally applicable\nlaws and the movement for same-sex marriage are on the recognition\nend. In the U.S. critics who view themselves as part of the\n\u201cprogressive left\u201d worry that the rise of the\n\u201ccultural left\u201d with its emphasis on multiculturalism and\ndifference turns the focus away from struggles for economic justice\n(Gitlin 1995, Rorty 1999). Critics in the United Kingdom and Europe\nhave also expressed concern about the effects of multiculturalism on\nsocial trust and public support for economic redistribution (Barry\n2001, Miller 2006, van Parijs 2004). Phillipe van Parijs\ninvited scholars to consider the proposition, \u201cOther things\nbeing equal, the more cultural... homogeneity within the population of\na defined territory, the better the prospects in terms of economic\nsolidarity\u201d (2004, 8).\n\nThere are two distinct concerns here. The first is that the existence\nof racial and ethnic diversity reduces social trust and solidarity,\nwhich in turn undermines public support for policies that involve\neconomic redistribution. For example, Robert Putnam argues that the\ndecline in social trust and civic participation in the U.S. is\nstrongly correlated with racial and ethnic diversity (2007). Rodney\nHero has shown that the greater the racial and ethnic heterogeneity in\na state, the more restrictive state-level welfare programs are (Hero\n1998, Hero and Preuhs 2007). Cross-national analyses suggest that\ndifferences in racial diversity explain a significant part of the\nreason why the U.S. has not developed a European-style welfare state\n(Alesina and Glaeser 2004). The second concern is that multiculturalism\npolicies themselves undermine the welfare-state by heightening the\nsalience of racial and ethnic differences among groups and undermining\na sense of common national identity that is viewed as necessary for a\nrobust welfare state (Barry 2001, Gitlin 1995, Rorty 1999).\n\nIn response, theorists of multiculturalism have called for and\ncollaborated on more empirical research of these purported trade-offs.\nWith respect to the first concern about the tension between diversity\nand redistribution, Kymlicka and Banting question the generalizability\nof the empirical evidence that is largely drawn from research either\non Africa, where the weakness of state institutions has meant no\nusable traditions or institutional capacity for dealing with\ndiversity, or on the U.S., where racial inequality has been shaped by\ncenturies of slavery and segregation. Where many minority groups are\nnewcomers and where state institutions are strong, the impact of\nincreasing diversity may be quite different (Kymlicka and Banting\n2006, 287). Barbara Arneil has also challenged Putnam\u2019s social capital\nthesis, arguing that participation in civil society has changed, not\ndeclined, largely as a result of mobilization among cultural\nminorities and women seeking greater inclusion and equality (Arneil\n2006a). She argues that it is not diversity itself that leads to\nchanges in trust and civic engagement but the politics of diversity,\ni.e. how different groups respond to and challenge the norms governing\ntheir society. The central issue, then, is not to reduce diversity but\nto determine principles and procedures by which differences are\nrenegotiated in the name of justice (Arneil and MacDonald 2010).\n\nAs for the second concern about the tradeoff between recognition and\nredistribution, the evidence upon which early redistributionist\ncritics such as Barry and Rorty relied was speculative and\nconjectural. Recent cross-national research suggests that there is no\nevidence of a systematic tendency for multiculturalism policies to\nweaken the welfare state (Banting et al. 2006). Irene Bloemraad\u2019s\ncomparative study of immigrant integration in Canada and the U.S.\noffers support for the view that not only is there no trade-off\nbetween multiculturalism and the welfare-state but multiculturalism\npolicies can actually increase attention and resources devoted to\nredistributive policies. She finds that Canada\u2019s multiculturalism\npolicies, which provide immigrants with a variety of services in their\nnative languages and encourage them to preserve their cultural\ntraditions even as they become Canadian citizens, are the main reason\nwhy the naturalization rate among permanent residents in Canada is\ntwice that of permanent residents in the U.S. Multiculturalists agree\nmore empirical research is needed, but they nonetheless maintain that\nredistribution and recognition are not either/or propositions. Both\nare important dimensions in the pursuit of equality for minority\ngroups. In practice, both redistribution and\nrecognition\u2014responding to material disadvantages and\nmarginalized identities and statuses\u2014are required to achieve\ngreater equality across lines of race, ethnicity, nationality,\nreligion, sexuality, and class, not least because many individuals\nstand at the intersection of these different categories and suffer\nmultiple forms of marginalization. A politics of recognition is\nimportant not only on account of its effects on socioeconomic status\nand political participation but also for the sake of full inclusion of\nmembers of marginalized groups as equal citizens.\n",
