    "main_text": "What Is It to Believe? || Normativism\n1.6 Normativism\n\nNormativists hold that belief necessarily has a normative or\nevaluative dimension. That is, they emphasize the idea that it is\ncentral to a mental state\u2019s being a belief that it is\nnecessarily defective in a certain way if it is false, unjustified, or\nnot rationally related to other attitudes. Shah and Velleman (2005)\nargue that conceiving of an attitude as a belief that P\nentails conceiving of it as governed by a norm of truth, that\nis, as an attitude that is correct if and only if P is true.\nEngel (2018) argues that among propositional attitudes, belief is the\nonly one whose \u201ccorrectness condition\u201d is truth,\ndistinguishing it from other closely related mental states, such as\nacceptances and epistemic feelings. (See also Wedgwood 2002; Gibbard\n2005; Gl\u00fcer and Wikforss 2013; McHugh and Whiting 2014.) Zangwill\n(2005) argues that part of the essence of belief is that if we believe\nthat P and that P implies Q we should believe that\nQ (note the difference from the functionalist view that\npossessing those two beliefs typically causes belief that\nQ). Helton (2020) and Flores (forthcoming) argue that\nbelieving entails having the capacity to rationally update one\u2019s\nbeliefs.\n\nSince normativism commits only to one necessary condition for a mental\nstate to qualify as a belief, it is not by itself a full positive\naccount of the nature of belief and is compatible with most of the\napproaches described above. Representationalist normativism, for\nexample, starts from the idea that representational systems are\nfunctional systems of a certain sort (Millikan 1984; Dretske 1988),\nand function appears to be a normative concept, implying at least a\ncontrast with malfunction. Burge (2010) argues that the \u201cprimary\nconstitutive function\u201d of believing is the production of\nveridical propositional representations. More broadly, belief has\noften been described as having a \u201cdirection of fit\u201d in the\nsense that beliefs (unlike, for example, desires) ought to\nfit with, or get it right about, or match up to, the states of affairs\nthey describe or represent (Anscombe 1957/1963; Searle 1983;\nHumberstone 1992; Frost 2014). If you believe that P and\nP is false, you have erred or made a mistake, whereas if you\ndesire that P and P is false, you have not in the\nsame way erred or made a mistake.\n",
