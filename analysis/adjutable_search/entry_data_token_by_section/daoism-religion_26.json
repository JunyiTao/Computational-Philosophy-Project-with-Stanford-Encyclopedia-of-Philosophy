Soteriology\n\nTerms meaning \u201clong life\u201d (shou,\nchangsheng) and \u201cimmortality\u201d (busi,\netc.) are among the most recurrent ones in Daoist literature. Both\nhave been understood in different ways according to the perspectives\nof the respective texts and authors. In general, liberation has been\nrepresented in Daoism according to two main models: \u201cunion with\nthe Dao\u201d (hedao and similar terms) and incorporation\ninto the celestial bureaucracy (not as a deity, but as an officer of\nthat bureaucracy). The highest form of liberation is often described\nas \u201cascension to Heaven\u201d (shengtian), attaining\n\u201ccelestial immortality\u201d (tianxian), or in\nanalogous terms, but the general concept of immortality has been\nconstrued in many ways.\n",
