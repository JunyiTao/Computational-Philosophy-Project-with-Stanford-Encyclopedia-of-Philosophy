    "main_text": "Philosophical Views || The Metaphysics of the Higher Realms\n3.4 Aristotle, Logic and Epistemology\n\nPorphyry was the first Platonist to write proper commentaries on\nAristotle\u2019s logical works and indeed on Aristotle generally\n(Karamanolis 2004) and from what can be gathered from what is extant\nhe does so without assuming a strong Platonist point of view. There is\nan extant commentary of his on Aristotle\u2019s Categories\nand another longer one in seven books, Ad Gedalium. This\nlatter work was for centuries known only in mere short fragments from\nlater commentators but a plausible case has been made that a recently\ndiscovered palimpsest contains a substantial portion of it\n(Chiaradonna et al. 2013). He also wrote commentaries on other parts\nof Aristotle\u00b4s Organon. He wrote the Isagoge,\nwhich is an introduction to Aristotle\u2019s logical works in\ngeneral. Through these logical writings Porphyry established himself\nas an important figure in the history of logic. He is the instigator\nof the tradition followed by subsequent Neoplatonists of taking\nAristotle\u2019s Categories as a basic introductory text and\nhis Isagoge in particular served as a standard introductory\ntext in Byzantium, the Arabic world and in the Latin West through\nBoethius\u2019 translations and commentary. These texts served as a\nbasic introductory texts in philosophy for at least 1000 years.\n\n\nPlatonists before Plotinus differed in their attitude towards\nAristotle (see Karamanolis 2006). Porphyry belongs to those who\nbelieved that Plato and Aristotle can be harmonized and in this he is\nfollowed by just about all subsequent ancient Platonists. A preserved\ntitle of a lost works of his, On the differences between Plato and\nAristotle, may seem to give contrary indications (he is also\nsupposed to have written a work about the unity of their thought).\nAdmitting some differences is compatible with a fundamentally\nreconciliatory attitude (cf. Karamanolis 2006: 243ff.). This positive\nattitude towards Aristotle is particularly evident from his position\non Aristotle\u2019s Categories. The question arises how such\nan attitude can be reconciled with those passages in Aristotle that\nseem to disagree with Plato, sometimes expressly. We do not know how\nPorphyry dealt with others of these, besides Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories, which appears to modern readers in many respects\nto be an anti-Platonic work. This is especially notable in its claim\nthat particular sensible substances are prior to the universal species\nand genera. Porphyry solves this dilemma by insisting that the\nso-called Aristotelian categories\u2014substance, quality, quantity\netc., dealt with in the Categories\u2014are\n\u201csignificant expressions\u201d. That is to say, the\nCategories is not a work in primary ontology but rather a\nwork about the expressions used to signify the sensible things around\nus and that the sense in which these are first or primary is that they\nare the first we meet with in our experience (58, 1ff.). The class of\nbeings signified by a universal term of this sort is indeed prior to\nthe universal term, e.g., the class of pale things to the universal\nterm \u2018pale\u2019. As Strange (1987, 1992) notes, this, however,\ndoes not affect the basic ontology. So interpreted the\nCategories is innocuous from a Platonic point of view: the\nrealm of Platonic intelligible Forms, which are universals of a\ndifferent kind than the expressions involved in the\nCategories, can be kept intact. The universals the\nIsagoge and Porphyry\u2019s commentaries on the\nCategories are concerned with are post rem\nuniversals abstracted by the mind from external objects met with\nthrough sense-perception.\n\nThe extant commentary on the Categories mentions only a dual\nsemantic relation, that between signifying expressions (words) and\nthings, whereas other sources attribute to Porphyry a triadic relation\nbetween words, concepts and things. This is probably the doctrine of\nthe longer lost commentary. The reason for the difference may be that\nin the short commentary he wanted to keep matters as simple as\npossible or as Griffin (2012) has proposed that the two views build on\ndifferent traditions.\n\nThere are two intertwined issues debated by scholars relating to\nPorphyry\u2019s philosophy of logic: One has to do with\nPorphyry\u2019s understanding of the relationship between\nAristotelian categories as \u201csignifying expressions\u201d and\nthe things these expressions refer to, the ontology. His remarks in\nthe Isagoge indicating that he will eschew difficult\nontological issues (1, 9\u201316) as well as the absence of\ndistinctively Platonic views in the Isagoge and the extant\ncommentary on the Categories have lead scholars to suppose\nthat he regarded logic as an ontologically uncommitted discipline that\ncould be freely adopted by different schools of different persuasions\n(Ebbesen 1990; Barnes 2003). There are strong reasons to believe,\nhowever, that Porphyry the logician cannot so easily be separated from\nPorphyry the philosopher. The Isagoge and the extant\ncommentary on the Categories are intended as elementary works\nbut not thereby philosophically neutral, unconnected with\nPorphyry\u2019 substantial views on the nature of things. That\nPorphyry\u2019s interpretation of the Categories brings with\nit certain ontological commitments is evident from the fact that he\ntook the signifying expressions, the categories, to reflect the\nstructure of the sensible world (cf. In Categorias., 58,\n21\u201329; Chiaradonna 2008). This is by no means a trivial\nassumption. The other issue has to do with Porphyry\u2019s stance\ntowards Plotinus\u2019 account of the Aristotelian categories in\nEnnead VI.1 and 3. Plotinus understands the\nCategories as a work in ontology rather than being about\nexpressions and he takes a critical view of it as such. What is\ndebated is to what extent this shows a deep disagreement between the\ntwo thinkers not only about the interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories but about the structure of the sensible realm and\nits relation to the intelligible causes. Chiaradonna (2002:\n48\u201354) argues forcefully, and in this author\u2019s view\nsuccessfully, that there is a breach with Plotinus on the issue.\nPorphyry accepted and adopted Aristotelian essentialism about sensible\nobjects along with Aristotle\u2019s categorization of them and sought\nto harmonize this view with his Platonist position about the\nintelligible causes of this realm. Plotinus did not share this view.\nPorphyry\u2019s line won the day in late antiquity. The opposite\nview, that there is a smooth continuation between Plotinus and\nPorphyry on the Aristotelian categories, is argued by Frans de Haas\n(2001).\n\nIn spite of the ontological assumptions behind the Isagoge\nand the lesser, extant commentary on the Categories,\nPorphyry\u2019s very disclaimers, his avoidance of the deep questions\nabout the ontological status of genera and species\u2014whether they\nexist or depend on thought; and if they exist, whether they are bodies\nor incorporeal; and if the latter, whether they are sensible items or\nexist separately from such\u2014no doubt contributed to the ease with\nwhich these works were taken into obligatory school readings for\ncenturies. Thus, his non-committal formulations of them helped make\nthese works the most lasting part of his legacy in West.\n\nIt has already been noted that Porphyry seems to be committed to a\nversion of abstractionism with regard to human beings\u2019\nacquisition of knowledge of sensibles. His Commentary on\nPtolemy\u2019s Harmonics contains a section about epistemology\n(11, 5\u201322, 7), in which the overarching theme is the question of\nthe respective roles of sense-perception and reason (logos)\nin the acquisition of knowledge. In the course of this discussion he\ndescribes a process starting from sense-perception, through\napprehension (antilepsis) and supposition (doxastike\nhypolepsis) to the reception of in the soul of a concept\n(epinoia), which is identical with the form of the object;\nhence come knowledge (episteme) and finally understanding\n(nous). Much of what Porphyry says here is compatible with\nMiddle Platonist and Peripatetic doctrines and with Plotinus (who is\nrather ambiguous about the details of this process) and indeed with\nAristotle. As regards the intellect, however, Porphyry\u2019s account\ncontains an unmistakable reference to Plato\u2019s Seventh letter,\nwhich would count against his assent to a purely Aristotelian account\nof the acquisition of knowledge about sensible objects (see Chase\n2010). More research is needed on these aspects of Porphyry\u2019s\nthought.\n",
