    "main_text": "What Is It to Believe? || Representationalism\n1.1 Representationalism\n\nIt is common to think of believing as involving\nentities\u2014beliefs\u2014that are in some sense contained in the\nmind. When someone learns a particular fact, for example, when Kai\nreads that garden snails are hermaphrodites, they acquire a new belief\n(in this case, the belief that garden snails are hermaphrodites). The\nfact in question\u2014or more accurately, a representation, symbol,\nor marker of that fact\u2014may be stored in memory and accessed or\nrecalled when necessary. In one way of speaking, the belief just is\nthe fact or proposition represented, or the particular stored token of\nthat fact or proposition; in another way of speaking, the belief is\nthe state of having such a fact or representation stored.\n\nIt is also common to suppose that beliefs play a causal role in the\nproduction of behavior. Continuing the example, we might imagine that\nafter learning about garden snail mating, Kai naturally turns their\nattention elsewhere, not consciously considering the matter for\nseveral days, until they and their ten-year-old daughter start\nwatching an internet video about molluscs. Involuntarily, Kai\u2019s\nnew knowledge about the hermaphroditism of garden snails is called up\nfrom memory. Kai says to her, \u201cDid you know that garden snails\nhave both male and female organs at the same time?\u201d It seems\nplausible to say that Kai\u2019s belief about garden snails, or their\npossession of that belief, caused, or figured in a causal explanation\nof, their utterance.\n\nVarious elements of this intuitive characterization of belief have\nbeen challenged by philosophers, but it is probably fair to say that\nthe majority of contemporary philosophers of mind accept the bulk of\nthis picture, which embodies the core ideas of the\nrepresentational approach to belief, according to which\ncentral cases of belief involve someone\u2019s having in their head\nor mind a representation with the same propositional content as the\nbelief. (But see \u00a72.2, below, for some caveats, and see the entry\non\n mental representation.)\n As discussed below, representationalists may diverge in their\naccounts of the nature of representation, and they need not agree\nabout what further conditions, besides possessing such a\nrepresentation, are necessary if a being is to qualify as having a\nbelief. Among the more prominent advocates of a representational\napproach to belief are Fodor (1975, 1981, 1987, 1990), Millikan (1984,\n1993), Dretske (1988), Burge (2010), Mandelbaum (2016; Quilty-Dunn and\nMandelbaum 2018), and Zimmerman (2018).\n\nOne strand of representationalism, endorsed by Fodor, takes mental\nrepresentations to be sentences in an internal language of\nthought. To get a sense of what this view amounts to, it is\nhelpful to start with an analogy. Computers are sometimes\ncharacterized as operating by manipulating sentences in \u201cmachine\nlanguage\u201d in accordance with certain rules. Consider a\nsimplified description of what happens as one enters numbers into a\nspreadsheet. Inputs from the keyboard cause the computer, depending on\nthe programs it is running and its internal state, to instantiate or\n\u201ctoken\u201d a sentence (in machine language) with the content\n(translated into English) of, for example, \u201cnumerical value 4 in\ncell A1\u201d. In accordance with certain rules, the machine then\ndisplays the shape \u201c4\u201d in a certain location on the\nmonitor, and perhaps, if it is implementing the rule \u201cthe values\nof column B are to be twice the values of column A\u201d, it tokens\nthe sentence \u201cnumerical value 8 in cell B1\u201d and displays\nthe shape \u201c8\u201d in another location on the monitor. If we\nsomeday construct a robot whose behavior resembles that of a human\nbeing, we might imagine it to operate along broadly the lines\ndescribed above\u2014that is, by manipulating machine-language\nsentences in accordance with rules, in connection with various\npotential inputs and outputs. Such a robot might somewhere store the\nmachine-language sentence whose English translation is \u201cthe\nchemical formula for water is H2O\u201d. We might suppose\nthis robot is able to act as does a human who possesses this belief\nbecause it is disposed to access this sentence appropriately on\nrelevant occasions: When asked \u201cof what chemical elements is\nwater compounded?\u201d, the robot accesses the water sentence and\nmanipulates it and other relevant sentences in such a way that it\nproduces an appropriate response.\n\nAccording to the language of thought hypothesis (see the entry on the\n language of thought hypothesis),\n our cognition proceeds rather like such a robot\u2019s. The formulae\nwe manipulate are not in \u201cmachine language\u201d, of course,\nbut rather in a species-wide \u201clanguage of thought\u201d. A\nsentence in the language of thought with some particular propositional\ncontent P is a \u201crepresentation\u201d of P. On\nthis view, a subject believes that P just in case they have a\nrepresentation of P that plays the right kind of role\u2014a\n\u201cbelief-like\u201d role\u2014in their cognition. That is, the\nrepresentation must not merely be instantiated somewhere in the mind\nor brain, but it must be deployed, or apt to be deployed, in ways we\nregard as characteristic of belief. For example, it must be apt to be\ncalled up for use in theoretical inferences toward which it is\nrelevant. It must be ready for appropriate deployment in deliberation\nabout means to desired ends. It is sometimes said, in such a case,\nthat the subject has the proposition P, or a representation\nof that proposition, tokened in their \u201cbelief box\u201d (though\nof course it is not assumed that there is any literal box-like\nstructure in the head).\n\nDretske\u2019s view centers on the idea of representational systems\nas systems with the function of tracking features of the world (for\nsimilar views, see Millikan 1984, 2017; Neander 2017). Organisms,\nespecially mobile ones, generally need to keep track of features of\ntheir environment to be evolutionarily successful. Consequently, they\ngenerally possess internal systems whose function it is to covary in\ncertain ways with the environment. For example, certain marine\nbacteria contain internal magnets that align with the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field. In the northern hemisphere, these bacteria, guided by\nthe magnets, propel themselves toward magnetic north. Since in the\nnorthern hemisphere magnetic north tends downward, they are thus\ncarried toward deeper water and sediment, and away from toxic,\noxygen-rich surface water. We might thus say that the magnetic system\nof these bacteria is a representational system that functions to\nindicate the direction of benign or oxygen-poor environments. In\ngeneral, on Dretske\u2019s view, an organism can be said to represent\nP just in case that organism contains a subsystem whose\nfunction it is to enter state A only if P holds, and\nthat subsystem is in state A.\n\nTo have beliefs, Dretske suggests, is to have an integrated manifold\nof such representational systems, acquired in part through associative\nlearning, poised to guide behavior. Given the lack of such a complex,\nand the lack of associative learning, magnetosome bacteria cannot, on\nDretske\u2019s view, rightly be regarded as literally possessing\nfull-fledged beliefs. But exactly how rich an organism\u2019s\nrepresentational structure must be for it to have beliefs, and in what\nways, Dretske regards as a terminological boundary dispute, rather\nthan a matter of deep ontological significance. (For more on belief in\nnon-human animals see \u00a74 below.)\n1.1.1. Representational Structure\n\nIf one accepts a representational view of belief, it\u2019s plausible\nto suppose that the relevant representations are structured\nin some way\u2014that the belief that P & Q,\nfor instance, shares something structurally in common with the belief\nthat P. To say this is not merely to say that the belief that\nP & Q has the following property: It cannot be\ntrue unless the belief that P is true. Consider the following\npossible development of Dretske\u2019s representational approach: An\norganism has developed a system that functions to detect whether\nP is or is not the case. It\u2019s supposed to enter state\nalpha when P is true; its being in alpha has the function of\nindicating P. Also, the organism has developed a separate\nsystem for detecting whether P & Q is the case.\nIt\u2019s supposed to enter state beta when P &\nQ is true; its being in beta has the function of indicating\nP & Q. But alpha and beta have nothing important\nin common other than what, in the outside world, they are supposed to\nrepresent; they have no structural similarity; one is not compounded\nin part from the other. Conceivably, all our beliefs could be set up\nin this way, having as little in common as alpha and beta\u2014one\ninternally unstructured representational state after another. To say\nthat mental representations are structured is in part to deny that our\nminds work like that.\n\nAmong the reasons to suppose that our representations are structured,\nFodor argues, are the productivity and systematicity\nof thought (Fodor 1987; Fodor and Pylyshyn 1988; Aizawa 2003). Thought\nand belief are \u201cproductive\u201d in the sense that we can\npotentially think or believe an indefinitely large number of things:\nthat elephants despise bowling, that 245 + 382 = 627, that river\nbottoms are usually not composed of blue beads. If representations are\nunstructured, each of these different potential beliefs must, once\nbelieved, be an entirely new state, not constructed from\nrepresentational elements previously available. Similarly, thought and\nbelief are \u201csystematic\u201d in the sense that an organism who\nthinks or believes that Mengzi repudiated Gaozi will normally also\nhave the capacity (if not necessarily the inclination) to think or\nbelieve that Gaozi repudiated Mengzi; an organism who thinks or\nbelieves that dogs are insipid and cats are resplendent will normally\nalso have the capacity to think or believe that dogs are resplendent\nand cats are insipid. If representations are structured, if they have\nelements that can be shuffled and recombined, the productivity and\nsystematicity of thought and belief seem naturally to follow.\nConversely, someone who holds that representations are unstructured\nhas, at least, some explaining to do to account for these features of\nthought. (So also, apparently, does someone who denies that belief is\nunderwritten or implemented by a representational system of any\nsort.)\n\nSupposing representations are structured, then, what kind of\nstructure do they have? Fodor notes that productivity and\nsystematicity are features not just of thought but also of language,\nand concludes that representational structure must be linguistic. He\nendorses the idea of an innate, species-wide language of thought (as\ndiscussed briefly in \u00a71.1 above); others tie the structure more\nclosely to the thinker\u2019s own natural (learned) language (Harman\n1973; Field 1978; Carruthers 1996). However, still others assert that\nthe representational structure underwriting belief isn\u2019t\nlanguage-like at all.\n\nA number of philosophers have argued that our cognitive\nrepresentations have, or can have, a map-like rather than a\nlinguistic structure (Lewis 1994; Braddon-Mitchell and Jackson 1996;\nCamp 2007, 2018; Rescorla 2009; though see Blumson 2012 and Johnson\n2015 for concerns about whether map-like and language-like structures\nare importantly distinct). Map-like representational systems are both\nproductive and systematic: By recombination and repetition of its\nelements, a map can represent indefinitely many potential states of\naffairs; and a map-like system that has the capacity, for example, to\nrepresent the river as north of the mountain will normally also have\nthe capacity to represent, by a re-arrangement of its parts, the\nmountain as north of the river. Although maps may sometimes involve\nwords or symbols, nothing linguistic seems to be essential to the\nnature of map-like representation: Some maps are purely pictorial or\ncombine pictorial elements with symbolic elements, like coloration to\nrepresent altitude, that we don\u2019t ordinarily think of as\nlinguistic.\n\nThe maps view makes nice sense of the fact that when a person changes\none belief, a multitude of other beliefs seem also to change\nsimultaneously and effortlessly: If you shift a mountain farther north\non a map, for example, you immediately and automatically change many\nother aspects of the representational system (the distance between the\nmountain and the north coast, the direction one must hike to go from\nthe mountain to the oasis, etc.). In contrast, if you change the\nlinguistic representation \u201cthe mountain peak is 15 km north of\nthe river\u201d to \u201cthe mountain peak is 20 km north of the\nriver\u201d, no other representation necessarily changes: It takes a\ncertain amount of inferential work to ramify the consequences\nthrough the rest of the system. Since it doesn\u2019t seem like\nwe\u2019re constantly making such a plethora of inferences, the maps\nview might have an advantage here. On the other hand, perhaps just\nbecause the linguistic view requires inference for what appears to\nhappen automatically on the maps view, the linguistic view can more\neasily account for failures of rationality, in which not all the\nnecessary changes are made and the subject ends up with an\ninconsistent view. Indeed generally speaking it\u2019s unclear how\nthe map view can accommodate inconsistent beliefs unless one allows a\nproliferation of maps, with the complications that ensue (like\nredundancy and mechanisms for relating the maps; Yalcin 2021). Certain\nsorts of indeterminacy may also be more difficult to accommodate in\nmap-like than in language-like structures. A linguistic representation\nlike \u201cthere are some lakes east of the mountain\u201d can leave\ncompletely unspecified how many lakes, of what shape, and where; a map\ndoes not, it seems, as easily do this. One further point of apparent\ndifference between the two views will be discussed in \u00a72.2 below.\nGenerally speaking, one might worry that the maps view\novergenerates and overspecifies beliefs, while the\nlinguistic view undergenerates and underspecifies\nthem.\n\nA third and very different way of thinking about representational\nstructure arises from the perspective of connectionism, a\nposition in cognitive science and computational theory. According to\nconnectionism, cognition proceeds by activation streaming through a\nseries of \u201cnodes\u201d connected by adjustable\n\u201cconnection weights\u201d\u2014somewhat as neural networks in\nthe brain can have different levels of activation and different\nstrengths of connection between each other. It is sometimes suggested\n(e.g., by van Gelder 1990; Smolensky 1995; Shea 2007) that the\nstructure of connectionist networks is representational but\nnon-linguistic or non-\u201ccompositional\u201d; and perhaps so also\nis human representational structure. However, it would take us too far\nafield to enter this technical issue here. (For more on this topic see\nthe entry on\n connectionism.)\n\nIt would perhaps be surprising if the representational structures of\nhuman cognition correspond precisely with any familiar technologies. A\npluralistic, computational approach to representational structure\nwould allow for multiple format types, each characterized by the\ncomputational vehicles\u2019 allowable value ranges and the\nconstraints on the relations among those values (Vernazzani and Mollo\nforthcoming).\n",
