    "main_text": "\n\nFor Thomas Aquinas, as for Aristotle, doing moral philosophy is\nthinking as generally as possible about what I should choose to do\n(and not to do), considering my whole life as a field of opportunity\n(or misuse of opportunity). Thinking as general as this concerns not\nmerely my own opportunities, but the kinds of good things that any\nhuman being can do and achieve, or be deprived of. Thinking about what\nto do is conveniently labeled \u201cpractical\u201d, and is\nconcerned with what and how to choose and do what one intelligently\nand reasonably can (i) to achieve intelligible goods in one\u2019s\nown life and the lives of other human beings and their environment,\nand (ii) to be of good character and live a life that as a whole will\nhave been a reasonable response to such opportunities.\n\nPolitical philosophy is, in one respect, simply that part or extension\nof moral philosophy which considers the kinds of choice that should be\nmade by all who share in the responsibility and authority of choosing\nfor a community of the comprehensive kind called political. In another\nrespect, it is a systematic explanatory account of the forms of\npolitical arrangement that experience and empirical observation show\nare available, with their characteristic features, outcomes, and\nadvantages (and disadvantages and bad aspects and consequences).\nThough in form descriptive and contemplative, and thus non-practical,\nthis aspect of political philosophy remains subordinate, in its\nsystematization or conceptual structure, to the categories one finds\nnecessary or appropriate when doing moral and political philosophy as\nit should be done, that is, as practical thinking by one whose every\nchoice (even the choice to do nothing now, or the choice to do moral\nor political philosophy) should be a good use of opportunity.\n\nMoral and political philosophy for Aquinas, then, is (1) the set or\nsets of concepts and propositions which, as principles and precepts of\naction, pick out the kinds of conduct (that is, chosen action) that\nare truly intelligent and reasonable for human individuals and\npolitical communities, together with (2) the arguments necessary to\njustify those concepts and propositions in the face of doubts, or at\nleast to defend them against objections. It is a fundamentally\npractical philosophy of principles which direct us towards\nhuman fulfillment (flourishing) so far as that happier\nstate of affairs is both constituted and achievable by way of the\nactions (chosen conduct) that both manifest and build up the\nexcellences of character traditionally called virtues. If one\nmust use a post-Kantian jargon, it is both \u201cteleological\u201d\nand \u201cdeontic\u201d, and not more the one than the other.\n",
