    "main_text": "Repeated Games and Coordination\n4. Repeated Games and Coordination\n\nSo far we\u2019ve restricted our attention to one-shot\ngames, that is, games in which players\u2019 strategic concerns\nextend no further than the terminal nodes of their single interaction.\nHowever, games are often played with future games in mind,\nand this can significantly alter their outcomes and equilibrium\nstrategies. Our topic in this section is repeated games, that\nis, games in which sets of players expect to face each other in\nsimilar situations on multiple occasions. We approach these first\nthrough the limited context of repeated prisoner\u2019s dilemmas.\n\n\nWe\u2019ve seen that in the one-shot PD the only NE is mutual\ndefection. This may no longer hold, however, if the players expect to\nmeet each other again in future PDs. Imagine that four firms, all\nmaking widgets, agree to maintain high prices by jointly restricting\nsupply. (That is, they form a cartel.) This will only work if each\nfirm maintains its agreed production quota. Typically, each firm can\nmaximize its profit by departing from its quota while the others\nobserve theirs, since it then sells more units at the higher market\nprice brought about by the almost-intact cartel. In the one-shot case,\nall firms would share this incentive to defect and the cartel would\nimmediately collapse. However, the firms expect to face each other in\ncompetition for a long period. In this case, each firm knows that if\nit breaks the cartel agreement, the others can punish it by\nunderpricing it for a period long enough to more than eliminate its\nshort-term gain. Of course, the punishing firms will take short-term\nlosses too during their period of underpricing. But these losses may\nbe worth taking if they serve to reestablish the cartel and bring\nabout maximum long-term prices.\n\nOne simple, and famous (but not, contrary to widespread myth,\nnecessarily optimal) strategy for preserving cooperation in repeated\nPDs is called Tit-for-tat. This strategy tells each player to\nbehave as follows:\n\nAlways cooperate in the first round.\nThereafter, take whatever action your opponent took in the\nprevious round.\n\n\nA group of players all playing Tit-for-tat will never see any\ndefections. Since, in a population where others play tit-for-tat, no\ntit-for-tat player could do (strictly) better by adopting an\nalternative strategy, everyone playing tit-for-tat is a NE. You may\nfrequently hear people who know a little (but not enough)\ngame theory talk as if this is the end of the story. It is not at all.\nThere are three major complications.\n\nFirst, and most fundamentally, everyone playing Tit-for-tat is not a\nunique NE. Many other strategies, such as Grim (cooperate\nuntil defected against by a player, then defect against that defector\nunconditionally forever) and Tit-for-two-tats (cooperate until\ndefected against twice by a player, then defect once before reverting\nto cooperation) occur in various NE combinations. In general, it is\nnot a requirement for equilibrium that all players use the same\nstrategy. The more limited virtue that can be claimed for Tit-for-tat\nis that it is a simple strategy that does well on average\nagainst the strategies that people tend, based on evidence from actual\ntournaments with real people, to choose. But this can also be claimed\nfor Grim. Whereas Tit-for-tat might be said to be \u2018nice\u2019\nbecause it is forgiving of offence, the opposite is true of Grim. In\ngeneral, there is an infinite set of combinations of strategies in a\nlarge population that are equilibria in repeated games if\nplayers don\u2019t know which round of the game will be the final one\nuntil they get there.\n\nThis last point is the second complication I promised to indicate. To\ncooperate in a repeated PD players must be uncertain as to when their\ninteraction ends. Suppose the players know when the last round comes.\nIn that round, it will be utility-maximizing for players to defect,\nsince no punishment will be possible. Now consider the second-last\nround. In this round, players also face no punishment for defection,\nsince they expect to defect in the last round anyway. So they defect\nin the second-last round. But this means they face no threat of\npunishment in the third-last round, and defect there too. We can\nsimply iterate this backwards through the game tree until we reach the\nfirst round. Since cooperation is not a NE strategy in that round,\ntit-for-tat is no longer a NE strategy in the repeated game, and we\nget the same outcome\u2014mutual defection\u2014as in the one-shot\nPD. Therefore, cooperation is only possible in repeated PDs where the\nexpected number of repetitions is indeterminate. (Of course, this does\napply to many real-life games.) Note that in this context any amount\nof uncertainty in expectations, or possibility of trembling hands,\nwill be conducive to cooperation, at least for awhile. When people in\nexperiments play repeated PDs with known end-points, they indeed tend\nto cooperate for awhile, but learn to defect earlier as they gain\nexperience.\n\nNow we introduce a third complication. Suppose that players\u2019\nability to distinguish defection from cooperation is imperfect.\nConsider our case of the widget cartel. Suppose the players observe a\nfall in the market price of widgets. Perhaps this is because a cartel\nmember cheated. Or perhaps it has resulted from an exogenous drop in\ndemand. If Tit-for-tat players mistake the second case for the first,\nthey will defect, thereby setting off a chain-reaction of mutual\ndefections from which they can never recover, since every player will\nreply to the first encountered defection with defection, thereby\nbegetting further defections, and so on.\n\nIf players know that such miscommunication is possible, they have\nincentive to resort to more sophisticated strategies. In particular,\nthey may be prepared to sometimes risk following defections with\ncooperation in order to test their inferences. However, if they are\ntoo forgiving, then other players can exploit them through\nadditional defections. In general, as strategies become more\nsophisticated, players of games in which they occur encounter more\ndifficult learning challenges. Because more sophisticated strategies\nare more difficult for other players to infer (because they are\ncompatible with more variable and complicated patterns of observable\nbehavior), their use increases the probability of miscommunication.\nBut miscommunication is what causes repeated-game cooperative\nequilibria to unravel in the first place. The complexities surrounding\ninformation signaling, screening and inference in repeated PDs help to\nintuitively explain the folk theorem, so called because no\none is sure who first recognized it, that in repeated PDs, for\nany strategy \\(S\\) there exists a possible distribution of\nstrategies among other players such that the vector of \\(S\\) and these\nother strategies is a NE. When critics of applications of game theory\nto behavioral and social science and business cases complain that the\napplications in question assume implausible levels of inferential\ncapacity on the part of people, this is what they have in mind. In\n Section 5\n we will consider a way of responding to this kind of concern.\n\nReal, complex, social and political dramas are seldom straightforward\ninstantiations of simple games such as PDs.\n Hardin (1995)\n offers an analysis of two tragically real political cases, the\nYugoslavian civil war of 1991\u201395, and the 1994 Rwandan genocide,\nas PDs that were nested inside coordination games.\n\nA coordination game occurs whenever the utility of two or more players\nis maximized by their doing the same thing as one another, and where\nsuch correspondence is more important to them than whatever it is, in\nparticular, that they both do. A standard example arises with rules of\nthe road: \u2018All drive on the left\u2019 and \u2018All drive on\nthe right\u2019 are both outcomes that are NEs, and neither is more\nefficient than the other. In games of \u2018pure\u2019 coordination,\nit doesn\u2019t even help to use more selective equilibrium criteria.\nFor example, suppose that we require our players to reason in\naccordance with Bayes\u2019s rule (see Section 3 above). In these\ncircumstances, any strategy that is a best reply to any vector of\nmixed strategies available in NE is said to be\nrationalizable. That is, a player can find a set of systems\nof beliefs for the other players such that any history of the game\nalong an equilibrium path is consistent with that set of systems. Pure\ncoordination games are characterized by non-unique vectors of\nrationalizable strategies. The Nobel laureate Thomas\n Schelling (1978)\n conjectured, and empirically demonstrated, that in such situations,\nplayers may try to predict equilibria by searching for focal\npoints, that is, features of some strategies that they believe\nwill be salient to other players, and that they believe other players\nwill believe to be salient to them. For example, if two people want to\nmeet on a given day in a big city but can\u2019t contact each other\nto arrange a specific time and place, both might sensibly go to the\ncity\u2019s most prominent downtown plaza at noon. In general, the\nbetter players know one another, or the more often they have been able\nto observe one another\u2019s strategic behavior, the more likely\nthey are to succeed in finding focal points on which to coordinate.\n\n\nCoordination was, indeed, the first topic of game-theoretic\napplication that came to the widespread attention of philosophers. In\n1969, the philosopher\n David Lewis (1969)\n published Convention, in which the conceptual framework of\ngame-theory was applied to one of the fundamental issues of\ntwentieth-century epistemology, the nature and extent of conventions\ngoverning semantics and their relationship to the justification of\npropositional beliefs. The basic insight can be captured using a\nsimple example. The word \u2018chicken\u2019 denotes chickens and\n\u2018ostrich\u2019 denotes ostriches. We would not be better or\nworse off if \u2018chicken\u2019 denoted ostriches and\n\u2018ostrich\u2019 denoted chickens; however, we would be\nworse off if half of us used the pair of words the first way and half\nthe second, or if all of us randomized between them to refer to\nflightless birds generally. This insight, of course, well preceded\nLewis; but what he recognized is that this situation has the logical\nform of a coordination game. Thus, while particular conventions may be\narbitrary, the interactive structures that stabilize and maintain them\nare not. Furthermore, the equilibria involved in coordinating on noun\nmeanings appear to have an arbitrary element only because we cannot\nPareto-rank them; but\n Millikan (1984)\n shows implicitly that in this respect they are atypical of linguistic\ncoordinations. They are certainly atypical of coordinating conventions\nin general, a point on which Lewis was misled by over-valuing\n\u2018semantic intuitions\u2019 about \u2018the meaning\u2019of\n\u2018convention\u2019\n (Bacharach 2006,\n Ross 2008a).\n\nRoss & LaCasse (1995)\n present the following example of a real-life coordination game in\nwhich the NE are not Pareto-indifferent, but the Pareto-inferior NE is\nmore frequently observed. In a city, drivers must coordinate on one of\ntwo NE with respect to their behaviour at traffic lights. Either all\nmust follow the strategy of rushing to try to race through lights that\nturn yellow (or amber) and pausing before proceeding when red lights\nshift to green, or all must follow the strategy of slowing down on\nyellows and jumping immediately off on shifts to green. Both patterns\nare NE, in that once a community has coordinated on one of them then\nno individual has an incentive to deviate: those who slow down on\nyellows while others are rushing them will get rear-ended, while those\nwho rush yellows in the other equilibrium will risk collision with\nthose who jump off straightaway on greens. Therefore, once a\ncity\u2019s traffic pattern settles on one of these equilibria it\nwill tend to stay there. And, indeed, these are the two patterns that\nare observed in the world\u2019s cities. However, the two equilibria\nare not Pareto-indifferent, since the second NE allows more cars to\nturn left on each cycle in a left-hand-drive jurisdiction, and right\non each cycle in a right-hand jurisdiction, which reduces the main\ncause of bottlenecks in urban road networks and allows all drivers to\nexpect greater efficiency in getting about. Unfortunately, for reasons\nabout which we can only speculate pending further empirical work and\nanalysis, far more cities are locked onto the Pareto-inferior NE than\non the Pareto-superior one.\n\nIn cases such as this one, maintenance of coordination game equilibria\nlikely must be supported by stable social norms, because\nplayers are anonymous and encounter regular opportunities to gain\nonce-off advantages by defecting from supporting the prevailing\nequilibrium. As many authors have observed (but see particularly\n Bicchieri 2006\n and\n Binmore 2005a),\n a stable norm must itself describe what players do in an equilibrium\nof the game, or at least one player would be incentivised to violate\nthe norm. But, as\n Guala (2016)\n argues, to perform a special role in helping players jointly find\nequilibrium in a coordination game, a norm must be more than\nan equilibrium description; it must also function as a rule.\nWhat Guala means by this is that it must encode expectations, which\nplayers know, about which behaviors in the relevant society will be\nrewarded by social approval if followed, and punished by social\nsanctions (e.g. gossip, ostracism, prosecution, vigilante violence) if\nviolated. The human biological inheritance causes most people to\ninternalize some norms, that is, learn to experience\nunpleasant feelings of guilt or shame when they violate norms they\nendorse, and feelings of satisfaction when they follow norms in the\nface of temptations to break them for selfish gain. Thus norms can\nhelp people find equilibria in coordination games even when some\nindividual choices in these games aren\u2019t observed by any other\npeople.\n\nOf course, norms are far from perfectly reliable mechanisms. Every\nreal society has many norms that some people don\u2019t endorse, and\ntherefore probably don\u2019t internalize, and therefore might break\nwhenever they think they can do so unobserved, or in return for a\npunishment they don\u2019t consider too costly. This provides endless\nfuel for conflict in any social setting with much degree of\ncomplexity. In addition, if its norms don\u2019t evolve with changing\ntechnology and other circumstances, a society will find itself trapped\nby conservatism in growing inefficiencies. But evolution of norms\nover time implies disagreements about norms at at\ntime, unless everyone switches norms at the same time. But\nthat would itself require solving a coordination game for which\nmeta-norms are typically absent! As\n Kuran (1995)\n empirically reviews and models, normative change often works through\ncycles of preference falsification and discovery. That is, increasing\nnumbers of people might privately come to dislike a norm but continue\nto publicly support and follow it because they assume that most others\nstill support it, and that conforming with it, and even helping to\nenforce it, is their equilibrium strategy. At a given time, a majority\nmight be behaving in this way, which prevents anyone from recognizing\nthat a new equilibrium without the norm, or with an opposed norm, is\navailable. Such concealed preferences tend to leak, however, and\nsooner or later publicly visible signals of widespread dissatisfaction\nwith the norm will be publicly observable. This often has the effect\nof suggesting that a whole society changed its mind suddenly and\ndramatically as the equilibrium flips. For example, in North American\nbusiness culture, executives went from norms favouring convivial\n\u2018liquid lunches\u2019 to strongly enforced norms against any\ndrinking during working hours within about two years during the\nmid-1980s. We can infer from this that many executives had considered\nboozy mid-day meals a bad thing while still engaging in them, before\nrealizing that this was the majority\u2019s hidden opinion. (Such\npreference falsification should not be confused with the superficially\nsimilar phenomenon of \u2018pluralistic ignorance\u2019. These are\ncases where many people have false beliefs about the statistical\nfrequency of a pattern of behavior, and are motivated to conform their\nown behavior to the norm suggested by this false belief. Pluralistic\nignorance tends to erode only slowly and gradually, as errors of\nstatistical perception are chipped away. not displaying the whipsaw\ninstability of equilibria sustained by preference falsification.\nPreference falsification is a directly strategic phenomenon and\ntherefore a topic for game theorists. Pluralistic ignorance has at\nbest a derivative game-theoretic element in some instances.)\n\nConventions on standards of evidence and scientific rationality, the\ntopics from philosophy of science that set up the context for\nLewis\u2019s analysis, are likely to be of the Pareto-rankable\ncharacter. While various arrangements might be NE in the social game\nof science, as followers of Thomas Kuhn like to remind us, it is\nhighly improbable that all of these lie on a single\nPareto-indifference curve. These themes, strongly represented in\ncontemporary epistemology, philosophy of science and philosophy of\nlanguage, are all at least implicit applications of game theory. (The\nreader can find a broad sample of applications, and references to the\nlarge literature, in\n Nozick (1998).)\n\nMost of the social and political coordination games played by people\nalso have this feature. Unfortunately for us all, inefficiency traps\nrepresented by Pareto-inferior NE are extremely common in them. And\nsometimes dynamics of this kind give rise to the most terrible of all\nrecurrent human collective behaviors. Hardin\u2019s analysis of two\nrecent genocidal episodes relies on the idea that the biologically\nshallow properties by which people sort themselves into racial and\nethnic groups serve highly efficiently as focal points in coordination\ngames, which in turn produce deadly PDs between them.\n\nAccording to Hardin, neither the Yugoslavian nor the Rwandan disasters\nwere PDs to begin with. That is, in neither situation, on either side,\ndid most people begin by preferring their exclusive ethnic interests\nto general mutual cooperation and regulated competition among\nindividuals and multi-ethnic associations. However, the deadly logic\nof coordination, deliberately abetted by self-serving politicians,\ndynamically created PDs. Some individual Serbs (Hutus) were\nencouraged to perceive their individual interests as best served\nthrough identification with Serbian (Hutu) group-interests. That is,\nthey found that some of their circumstances, such as those involving\ncompetition for jobs, had the form of coordination games\nwithin their respective ethnic communities. This incentivised\nincreasing numbers of people to put pressure on their ethnic\ncompatriots to take up coordinating strategies. Eventually, once\nenough Serbs (Hutus) identified self-interest with group-interest, the\nidentification became almost universally correct, because (1)\nthe most important goal for each Serb (Hutu) was to do roughly what\nevery other Serb (Hutu) would, and (2) the most distinctively\nSerbian thing to do, the doing of which signalled\ncoordination, was to exclude Croats (Tutsi). That is, strategies\ninvolving such exclusionary behavior were selected as a result of\nhaving efficient focal points. This situation made it the case that an\nindividual\u2014and individually threatened\u2014Croat\u2019s\n(Tutsi\u2019s) self-interest was best maximized by coordinating on\nassertive Croat (Tutsi) group-identity, which further increased\npressures on Serbs (Hutus) to coordinate, and so on. Note that it is\nnot an aspect of this analysis to suggest that Serbs or Hutus started\nthings; the process could have been (even if it wasn\u2019t in fact)\nperfectly reciprocal. But the outcome is ghastly: Serbs and Croats\n(Hutus and Tutsis) seem progressively more threatening to each other\nas they rally together for self-defense, until both see it as\nimperative to preempt their rivals and strike before being struck. If\nHardin is right\u2014and the point here is not to claim that he\nis, but rather to point out the worldly importance of\ndetermining which games agents are in fact playing\u2014then the mere\npresence of an external enforcer (NATO?) would not have changed the\ngame, pace the Hobbesian analysis, since the enforcer could not have\nthreatened either side with anything worse than what each feared from\nthe other. What was needed was recalibration of evaluations of\ninterests, which (arguably) happened in Yugoslavia when the Croatian\narmy began to decisively win, at which point Bosnian Serbs decided\nthat their self/group interests were better served by the arrival of\nNATO peacekeepers. The Rwandan genocide likewise ended with a military\nsolution, in this case a Tutsi victory. (But this became the seed for\nthe most deadly international war on earth since 1945, the Congo War\nof 1998\u20132006.)\n\nThis dynamic of coordinating polarization is frequently invoked by\npolitical scientists to explain escalating conflict within countries.\nIts basis need not be ethnicity. For another example, the widely\nobserved increase in polarization of party-political identities in the\nUnited States over the past three decades is often modelled using\ngame-theoretic logic along Hardin\u2019s lines. In a two-party system\nsuch as America\u2019s, if supporters of one party come to believe\nthat having their party in power is more important than its policies\non particular issues, and so begin behaving overwhelmingly\nstrategically and opportunistically, this behavior incentivises\nsupporters of the other party to adopt the same attitude. The beliefs\nin question are thus self-ratifying, making it true that the\nhighest interest stakes for both sets of supporters is in the victory\nof their own faction. Relentless zero-sum competition conditioned on\nparty affiliation erodes cross-party associations, and in the US was\nobserved as early as 2009\n (Bishop 2009)\n to be causing Americans to separate geographically and culturally\ninto blocks that recognise and define themselves mainly by contrast\nwith one another\u2019s symbols and icons. Once people incorporate\npolitical preferences into their conceptions of their identities, it\nbecomes extremely difficult to present anyone with effectively\ncompeting counter-incentives; as discussed in\n Ross (2005a),\n most people rank maintenance of their social identities near or at\nthe top of their effective preference orderings, for reasons that\ngame-theoretic models explain well: a person whose social identity\nappears as indeterminate or unsteady to others will have difficulty\nfinding coordination partners. Forming teams to carry out group\nprojects is the basic human survival strategy. Thus the game-theoretic\nlens helps us to see that the roots of our ecological success as a\nspecies are also the roots of our tendency to form mutually hostile\nethnic or purely cultural tribes, which is in turn the most\nbasic source of large-scale, generally destructive, human conflict.\n\n\nOf course, it is not the case that most repeated games lead to\ndisasters. The biological basis of friendship in people and other\nanimals is partly a function of the logic of repeated games. The\nimportance of payoffs achievable through cooperation in future games\nleads those who expect to interact in them to be less selfish than\ntemptation would otherwise encourage in present games. The fact that\nsuch equilibria become more stable through learning gives friends the\nlogical character of built-up investments, which most people take\ngreat pleasure in sentimentalizing. Furthermore, cultivating shared\ninterests and sentiments provides networks of focal points around\nwhich coordination can be increasingly facilitated. Coordination is in\nturn the foundation of both cooperation and the controlled\ncompetition that drives material and cultural innovation.\n\nA key sub-theme of coordination is specialization of labor within\nteams. Because the first extended commentary on this topic was given\nby Adam Smith, who is associated with the origin of rigorous\neconomics, specialization of labor is strongly culturally associated,\neverywhere in the world, with commercial production. However, it has\nbeen a fundamental feature of human life since the dawn of our\nspecies. The paleoeconomist\n Haim Ofek (2001)\n argues persuasively that our immediate pre-Sapiens ancestors\nwere able to control fire because they learned to divide labor between\nspecialist fire-maintainers, and, on the other side of the market,\nthose who gathered and hunted. Cooking, which vastly increased the\nefficiency of food consumption and freed proto-people to devote time\nto other things such as cultivation of tools and social enrichment,\nwas in turn an essential triggering condition for the explosive growth\nof the human brain\n (Wrangham 2009),\n and subsequently, as argued by\n Planer and Sterelny (2009),\n for the emergence of language. Thus on Ofek\u2019s account,\ncoordinated specialisation of labor in the most narrowly and literally\neconomic sense lay at the very foundation of the human career; the\nfirst people who maintained fire station services that they bartered\nfor the kills and tools of their customers were the first business\nenterprises. Perhaps paleolithic fire station operators competed for\ncustomers and for accessible sites protected from rain by overhead\nrock ledges or cave ceilings; if so, the logic of industrial\norganization theory, the first sub-field of economics taken over by\ngame theory, would have applied to their strategizing.\n\nIn the simplest models of specialization of labor, the different roles\ncan be assigned by chance. If two of us are making pizza, who grates\nthe cheese and who slices the mushrooms might be decided by who\nhappens to be standing closer to which implement. But this kind of\nsituation isn\u2019t typical. More often, role assignments are a\nfunction of differential abilities. If two of us will row a boat, and\none of us is right-handed while the other is left-handed, it\u2019s\nobvious who should sit on which side. In this case there should be no\ncall for strategic bargaining over who does what, because benefits\narising from getting where we want to go as quickly as possible are\nsymmetrically shared. But this is also an atypical kind of\ncase. More frequently, some roles are less costly to perform than\nothers, or attract greater expected rewards. Everyone who has formed a\nrock band knows that a disproportionate share of fame and fringe\nbenefits tends to go to the lead guitarist rather than the drummer or\nthe bass player. For decades after the birth of rock, there was a\nnotable absence of female lead guitarists among successful bands, and\nmuch consequent commentary by female musicians and fans about pompous\nmacho posturing in the common stage attitudes of \u2018guitar\nheroes\u2019. Bands like Sleater-Kinney and the Breeders have been\nnotable for pushing back against this cultural trope. This example\ndraws attention to a much more general and deeply important aspect of\nspecialization of labor, on which game theory sheds crucial light.\n\nAs discussed above, specialization of labor was foundational for the\nevolution and rise to ecological dominance of the human species. And\nthe most pervasive and significant basis for assigning differentiated\nroles, observed in every naturally arising human population, is sex.\nThe original basis for this is almost certainly some asymmetries in\nrelative performance advantages on different tasks, as in the case of\nthe boat rowers. Hunting large game is more efficiently carried out by\npeople with bigger muscles. Furthermore, hunting requires mobility and\noften silence, so is best not done while carrying babies. Thus a very\ncommon, though not universal, pattern of specialization in\nhunter-gatherer communities, including surviving contemporary ones, is\nfor men to hunt while women gather and perform tasks, such as mending\nand food processing, that can be carried out at home base and combined\nwith child-minding. The consequences of this are politically profound.\nHunters become masters of weapons. Masters of weapons tend to exercise\ndisproportionate power, especially if, as in later stages of human\necological history, the communities they belong to periodically engage\nin violent conflict with other groups. It has long been understood\nthat the roots of male political and social dominance that is the\npredominant pattern across human history and cultures has its roots in\nthis ancient division of productive roles.\n\nIn modern societies, hunting is fringe activity and the most powerful\npeople are not those who are most adept at throwing spears. This has\nbeen so, in most cultural lines, for a very long time, so there has\nbeen plenty of scope for cultural evolution to wash away traditional\nsources of power imbalance. This makes the stubborn persistence of\ngendered inequality puzzling at first glance. It has often fostered\nspeculation about possible innate male dispositions to be more\neffective, or at least more ruthless, executives and presidents. Or\nperhaps, it is sometimes suggested, the ultimate source of the power\nasymmetry is asymmetry of threats of physical violence in households.\n(This is certainly real, and a genuine basis for male tyranny in many\ndomestic partnerships. But what is at issue is whether it suffices to\nexplain pervasive patterns.) Recent work by the game theorist\n Cailin O\u2019Connor (2019)\n suggests a deeper and much more powerful explanation. It is more\nscientifically powerful partly because it fits a range of evidence\nmore closely than the reductive stories just mentioned, but also\nbecause it accounts for more specific side-effects of the general\nphenomenon. In particular, it explains the stabilization of culturally\nlearned gender characteristics that help people signal awareness and\nacceptance of roles expected to be associated with their biological\nsexes. Of course, this cultural code, since it can be strategically\nmanipulated, also allows some people to signal rejection of\nthese roles, and to coordinate this rejection with other women, men,\nor non-binary people, who seek reformed equilibria.\n\nO\u2019Connor\u2019s game-theoretic analysis comes in two parts.\nFirst, she uses evolutionary game theory, the topic of\n Section 7\n below, to show how relatively functionally minor asymmetries\nin role effectiveness can foster extremely robust use of group\ndifference markers that entrench unequal outcomes. Selecting\nequilibria for role specialization is, as we\u2019ve seen earlier in\nthis section, logically difficult in the absence of correlation\nsignals. A society will tend to seize on any such signal that is\nfrequently and reliably available, and following equilibrium\nstrategies based on such signals is in each player\u2019s marginal\nself-interest from game to game, even if, as in the PD, many or even\nall could be better off if the whole set of agents could flip to an\nalternative equilibrium. Then, as we have also discussed, the signals\nin question will tend to culturally evolve into the basis for norms,\nso that, as in the phenomenon under discussion, women who \u2018walk\nlike men\u2019or \u2018talk like men\u2019or show interest in\n\u2018male\u2019activities or sexual partners are subject to\nsanctions, including by many other women. Thus does sex beget gender.\n(Notice that if women really were less competent leaders than\nmen, then, given that leadership is typically earned through\ncompetition in functional settings, it is not clear why sexually\ndifferentiated roles would need to be sustained by normative\ngenders in the first place.) In effect, O\u2019Connor\u2019s first\napplication of game theory shows that women are assigned different\nsocial roles from men, which leads to inequality, simply because\n\u2018sex\u2019is a group assignment we can usually (not quite\nalways) determine about a person at birth, before we embark on\nsocializing them. (The reader will note that similar logic based on\ncorrelated equilibrium applies to the normative construct of race,\nwhich has no basis in expected functional capacities at all. This\npartly explains why discrimination against people whose\n\u2018race\u2019can be assigned at a glance, such as Black people in\nthe US, has been vastly harder to overcome than earlier racist\ndiscrimination against Irish people in the same country.)\n\nSexual inequality arising as an equilibrium selection effect may (and\nshould) be criticized on moral grounds, but at least we can recognize\nthat it arose due to (partly) compensating efficiencies. Against this\nstandard, the second part of O\u2019Connor\u2019s analysis suggests\nno such trade-off.\n\nAt the dawn of the development of game theory,\n Nash (1950b)\n modelled a general case of two agents bargaining over the division of\na surplus they could obtain together. Obviously, this is as central a\nphenomenon for economists as anything else it is their job to think\nabout, as important in a simple bartering society as in a capitalist\none. The core of the so-called \u2018Nash bargaining solution\u2019\nis that the equilibria for such negotiations are conditional on the\nrelative values of their fall-back positions should they fail to reach\nagreement. You can get me to pay more for your house if you know that,\nshould we not reach a deal, I\u2019ll have nowhere to put my\nfurniture when my my boat arrives in port. As discussed in depth by\nKen Binmore\n (1994,\n 1998,\n 2005a),\n superior fall-backs in bargaining contexts are the basic source of\npower differentials in a society. Furthermore, as Binmore also argues,\na society\u2019s specific norms tend to evolve to accommodate these\nasymmetries, since failures of alignment in expectations about\n\u2018fairness\u2019in bargaining are every community\u2019s most\nfrequent cause of conflict and of investment failures. O\u2019Connor\napplies this element of game theory to inequality of sex and\ngender.\n\nShe begins where the first part of her analysis leaves off: with\nnormatively entrenched gendered roles that evolve as equilibrium\nselection devices but produce inequality. Note that this is a feature\nof the social macrostructure, the domain of application for\nevolutionary game theory. She then examines the\nmicro-dynamics of a statistically typical household from the\nperspective of Nash bargaining theory (and also using tools from\nstrategic network theory, as touched upon in\n Section 5).\n Evidence from wealthy countries shows that in the subset of\nhouseholds in which men\u2019s and women\u2019s levels of education\nand income have converged, women continue on average to do\ndisproportionate shares of home maintenance work, and their leisure\nhours have declined. Nash bargaining theory can explain why. Suppose\nwe interpret the meaning of a general bargaining breakdown in the case\nof a marriage as divorce. If men spend more time and energy outside\nthe home than women, they thereby build larger flows and stocks of the\nsocial networking assets that make the inefficiencies of single life\nless costly, and are more likely to advance their earning power. Thus\nthey enjoy stronger fall-back positions where bargaining over the\ndivision of household responsibilities is concerned. The unequal\nequilibrium is thus self-amplifying over time, as men\u2019s networks\nprogressively deepen and become more relatively valuable over the\ncourse of both partners\u2019 careers. To accept the relevance of the\nmodel, we need not imagine husbands and wives literally haggling over\nexplicit shares of time, with calculations of expected marginal\ncontributions to household income cited as arguments. We need merely\npicture women repeatedly leaving their offices earlier to pick up\nchildren or receive home service calls because their husbands are\ncontinuously tied up in meetings or business trips with higher stakes\non the immediate line. Unlike the games in the first part of\nO\u2019Connor\u2019s analysis, there are no social efficiencies\nachieved in exchange for this dynamic inequity, since there is no\nreason to suppose that women are intrinsically likely to have less\neconomically productive careers than similarly educated men. And the\npattern of falling female leisure time may increase with\nwomen\u2019s educational advancement, as more demanding professional\nactivities are piled atop stationary levels of household\nresponsibility. (Past a certain level of a household\u2019s wealth we\nmight expect this effect to reverse, as women can hire in-home\nservice. But this applies only to a small upper share of the income\ndistribution.) This part of O\u2019Connor\u2019s model has direct\npolicy implications. Efforts to improve women\u2019s access to\nvaluable credentials, and to encourage companies to increase female\nrepresentation at executive levels, may have muted or even negative\neffects on welfare equality between the sexes. Societies might also\nneed to devote more substantial resources to subsidising childcare\nprovision outside of homes, and living assistance to ageing parents,\nas measures that increase women\u2019s intra-household bargaining\npower. \n\nThe first part of O\u2019Connor\u2019s analysis also has important\nimplications for policy. As she stresses, if inequalities between\ndifferentiable groups arise naturally through equilibrium dynamics in\ncoordination games, then we should not expect to be able to find\npolicies that eradicate them once and for all. Controlling inequality,\nO\u2019Connor concludes, calls for persistent and recurrently applied\npolitical effort by egalitarians. \n\nIn general, coordination dynamics constitute the analytical core of\nthe majority of human social patterns. Examples considered\nhere are merely illustrative of a limitless array of such phenomena,\nwhich cannot be fully understood without empirically guided\nconstruction and application of game-theoretic models. \n5. Team Reasoning and Conditional Games\n\nFollowing\n Lewis\u2019s (1969)\n introduction of coordination games into the philosophical literature,\nthe philosopher Margaret\n Gilbert (1989)\n argued, as against Lewis, that game theory is the wrong kind of\nanalytical technology for thinking about human conventions because,\namong other problems, it is too \u2018individualistic\u2019, whereas\nconventions are essentially social phenomena. More directly, her claim\nwas that conventions are not merely the products of decisions of many\nindividual people, as might be suggested by a theorist who modeled a\nconvention as an equilibrium of an \\(n\\)-person game in which each\nplayer was a single person. Similar concerns about allegedly\nindividualistic foundations of game theory have been echoed by another\nphilosopher, Martin\n Hollis (1998)\n and economists Robert Sugden\n (1993,\n 2000,\n 2003)\n and Michael\n Bacharach (2006).\n In particular, it motivated Bacharach to propose a theory of team\nreasoning, which was completed by Sugden, along with Nathalie\nGold, after Bacharach\u2019s death. In this section we will review\nthe idea of team reasoning, along with an alternative way of applying\ngame theory to sociological topics, the theory of conditional\ngames\n (Stirling (2012);\n Ross and Stirling 2021). \n\nConsider again the one-shot Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma as discussed in\n Section 2.4\n and produced, with an inverted matrix for ease of subsequent\ndiscussion, as follows:\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\\(C\\)\n\\(D\\)\n\nI\n\\(C\\)\n2,2\n0,3\n\n\\(D\\)\n3,0\n1,1 \n\n\n\n(C denotes the strategy of cooperating with one\u2019s opponent\n(i.e., refusing to confess) and D denotes the strategy of defecting on\na deal with one\u2019s opponent (i.e., confessing).) Many people find\nit incredible when a game theorist tells them that players designated\nwith the honorific \u2018rational\u2019 must choose in this game in\nsuch a way as to produce the outcome (D,D). The explanation seems to\nrequire appeal to very strong forms of both descriptive and normative\nindividualism. After all, if the players attached higher value to the\nsocial good (for their 2-person society of thieves) than to their\nindividual welfare, they could then do better individually too;\nobstinate individualism, it is objected, yields behavior that is\nperverse from the individually optimizing point of view, and so seems\nincoherent. The players undermine their own welfare, one might argue,\nbecause they obstinately refuse to pay any attention to the social\ncontext of their choices.\n Sugden (1993)\n seems to have been the first to suggest that even non-altruistic\nplayers in the one-shot PD might jointly see that they could reason\nas a team, that is, arrive at their choices of strategies by\nasking \u2018What is best for us?\u2019 instead of\n\u2019What is best for me?\u2019.\n\nBinmore (1994)\n forcefully argues that this line of criticism confuses game theory as\nmathematics with questions about which game theoretic models are most\ntypically applicable to situations in which people find themselves. If\nplayers value the utility of a team they\u2019re part of over and\nabove their more narrowly individualistic interests, then this should\nbe represented in the payoffs associated with a game theoretic model\nof their choices. In the situation modeled as a PD above, if the two\nplayers\u2019 concern for \u2018the team\u2019 were strong enough\nto induce a switch in strategies from D to C, then the payoffs in the\n(cardinally interpreted) upper left cell would have to be raised to at\nleast 3. (At 3, players would be indifferent between\ncooperating and defecting.) Then we get the following transformation\nof the game: \n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\\(C\\)\n\\(D\\)\n\nI\n\\(C\\)\n4,4\n0,3\n\n\\(D\\)\n3,0\n1,1 \n\n\n\nThis is no longer a PD; it is an Assurance game, which has\ntwo NE at (C,C) and (D,D), with the former being Pareto superior to\nthe latter. Thus if the players find this equilibrium, we should not\nsay that they have played non-NE strategies in a PD. Rather, we should\nsay that the PD was the wrong model of their situation.\n\nThe critic of individualism can acknowledge Binmore\u2019s logical\npoint but accommodate it by arguing that changing the game is exactly\nwhat people should try to do if they find themselves in situations\nthat, when the relevant interpretation of economic agency is\nindividualistic, have the structure of PDs. This is precisely\nBacharach\u2019s theoretical proposal. His scientific executors,\nSugden and Gold, in\n Bacharach (2006),\n pp. 171\u2013173), unlike\n Hollis and Sugden (1993),\n use the standard convention for payoff interpretation, under which\nplayers can only be modeled as cooperating in a one-shot PD if at\nleast one player makes an error. Under this assumption, Bacharach,\nSugden and Gold argue, human game players will often or usually avoid\nframing situations in such a way that a one-shot PD is the right model\nof their circumstances. A situation that \u2018individualistic\u2019\nagents would frame as a PD might be framed by \u2018team\nreasoning\u2019 agents as the Assurance game transformation above.\nNote that the welfare of the team might make a difference to\n(cardinal) payoffs without making enough of a difference to\ntrump the lure of unilateral defection. Suppose it bumped them up to\n2.5 for each player; then the game would remain a PD. This point is\nimportant, since in experiments in which subjects play sequences of\none-shot PDs (not repeated PDs, since opponents in the\nexperiments change from round to round), majorities of subjects begin\nby cooperating but learn to defect as the experiments progress. On\nBacharach\u2019s account of this phenomenon, these subjects initially\nframe the game as team reasoners. However, a minority of subjects\nframe it as individualistic reasoners and defect, taking free\nriders\u2019 profits. The team reasoners then re-frame the situation\nto defend themselves. This introduces a crucial aspect of\nBacharach\u2019s account. Individualistic reasoners and team\nreasoners are not claimed to be different types of people. People,\nBacharach maintains, tend to flip back and forth between\nindividualistic agency and participation in team agency.\n\nNow consider the following Pure Coordination game:\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\\(C\\)\n\\(D\\)\n\nI\n\\(C\\)\n1,1\n0,0\n\n\\(D\\)\n0,0\n1,1 \n\n\n\nWe can interpret this as representing a situation in which players are\nnarrowly individualistic, and thus each indifferent between the two NE\nof (U, L) and (D, R), or are team reasoners but haven\u2019t\nrecognized that their team is better off if they stabilize around one\nof the NE rather than the other. If they do come to such recognition,\nperhaps by finding a focal point, then the Pure Coordination game is\ntransformed into the following game known as Hi-Lo:\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\\(t_1\\)\n\\(t_2\\)\n\nI\n\\(s_1\\)\n10,10\n0,0\n\n\\(s_2\\)\n0,0\n1,1 \n\n\n\nCrucially, here the transformation requires more than mere\nteam reasoning. The players also need focal points to know which of\nthe two Pure Coordination equilibria offers the less risky prospect\nfor social stabilization\n (Binmore 2008).\n In fact, Bacharach and his executors are interested in the\nrelationship between Pure Coordination games and Hi-Lo games for a\nspecial reason. It does not seem to imply any criticism of NE as a\nsolution concept that it doesn\u2019t favor one strategy vector over\nanother in a Pure Coordination game. However, NE also\ndoesn\u2019t favor the choice of (U, L) over (D, R) in the Hi-Lo game\ndepicted, because (D, R) is also a NE. At this point Bacharach and his\nfriends adopt the philosophical reasoning of the refinement program.\nSurely, they complain, \u2018rationality\u2019 recommends (U, L).\nTherefore, they conclude, axioms for team reasoning should be built\ninto refined foundations of game theory.\n\nWe need not endorse the idea that game theoretic solution concepts\nshould be refined to accommodate an intuitive general concept of\nrationality to motivate interest in Bacharach\u2019s contribution.\nThe non-psychological game theorist can propose a subtle shift of\nemphasis: instead of worrying about whether our models should respect\na team-centred norm of rationality, we might simply point to empirical\nevidence that people, and perhaps other agents, seem to often make\nchoices that reveal preferences that are conditional on the welfare of\ngroups with which they are associated. To this extent their agency is\npartly or wholly\u2014and perhaps stochastically\u2014identified\nwith these groups, and this will need to be reflected when we model\ntheir agency using utility functions. Then we could better describe\nthe theory we want as a theory of team-centred choice rather than as a\ntheory of team reasoning. Note that this philosophical\ninterpretation is consistent with the idea that some of our evidence,\nperhaps even our best evidence, for the existence of team-centred\nchoice is psychological. It is also consistent with the suggestion\nthat the processes that flip people between individualized and\nteam-centred agency are often not deliberative or consciously\nrepresented. The point is simply that we need not follow Bacharach in\nthinking of game theory as a model of reasoning or rationality in\norder to be persuaded that he has identified a gap we would like to\nhave formal resources to fill.\n\nSo, do people\u2019s choices seem to reveal team-centred\npreferences? Standard examples, including Bacharach\u2019s own, are\ndrawn from team sports. Members of such teams are under considerable\nsocial pressure to choose actions that maximize prospects for victory\nover actions that augment their personal statistics. The problem with\nthese examples is that they embed difficult identification problems\nwith respect to the estimation of utility functions; a narrowly\nself-interested player who wants to be popular with fans might behave\nidentically to a team-centred player. Soldiers in battle conditions\nprovide more persuasive examples. Though trying to convince soldiers\nto sacrifice their lives in the interests of their countries is often\nineffective, most soldiers can be induced to take extraordinary risks\nin defense of their buddies, or when enemies directly menace their\nhome towns and families. It is easy to think of other kinds of teams\nwith which most people plausibly identify some or most of the time:\nproject groups, small companies, political constituency committees,\nlocal labor unions, clans and households. Strongly individualistic\nsocial theory tries to construct such teams as equilibria in games\namongst individual people, but no assumption built into game theory\n(or, for that matter, mainstream economic theory) forces this\nperspective (see\n Guala (2016)\n for a critical review of options). We can instead suppose that teams\nare often exogenously welded into being by complex interrelated\npsychological and institutional processes. This invites the game\ntheorist to conceive of a mathematical mission that consists not in\nmodeling team reasoning, but rather in modeling choice that is\nconditional on the existence of team dynamics.\n\nStirling (2012)\n formalizes such conditional interactions for use in a special\napplication context: an AI system with a distributed-control\narchitecture. Such systems achieve processing efficiencies by\ndevolving aspects of problems to specialized sub-systems. The\nefficiencies in question are not achievable unless the sub-systems\noperate their own utility functions; otherwise the system is really\njust a standard computer with an executive control bottleneck that\ncalls sub-routines. But if the sub-systems are, then, distinct\neconomic agents, risk of incoherence arises at the level of the whole\nsystem. It might, that is, behave like a typical democratic political\ncommunity, pursuing contradictory policies or falling into gridlock\nand paralysis. An engineer of such a system would include avoidance of\nsuch problems in her design specs. Is there a way in which the design\ncould implement the advantages of genuine distributed control among\nsub-agents while also ensuring consistency at the whole-system level?\nThis is the problem Stirling set out to solve. The resemblance to\nBacharach\u2019s conception emerges if we frame Stirling\u2019s\nchallenge as follows: we want the sub-agents to interact\nwith\u2014that is, play games amongst\u2014one another as\nindividuals, but then we want to allow only solutions that would be\nproducts of team reasoning. \n\nOne of Stirling\u2019s two basic innovations is to have players\ncondition their choices on one another\u2019s action profiles rather\nthan on outcomes. The motivation for this is that while the sub-agents\nare choosing as individuals, they cannot simultaneously know what\nutilities will be assigned to outcomes at the team level. (If they\ndid, we would again assume away what makes the problem interesting,\nand the sub-agents would just be sub-routines.) Here Stirling\nconsiders an analogy from human social psychology, which will turn out\nto be the germ of a conceptual innovation when we shift the\napplication context away from AI design and back to social\nscience.\n\nStirling\u2019s analogy to a human phenomenon draws on the point that\npeople often encounter contexts of interaction with others in which\ntheir preferences are not fully formed in advance. Psychologists study\nthis under the label of \u2018preference construction\u2019\n (Lichtenstein and Slovic 2006),\n reflecting the intuition that people build their preferences\nthrough interaction. Stirling provides a simple (arguably too\nsimple) example from\n Keeney and Raiffa (1976),\n in which a farmer forms a clear preference among different climate\nconditions for a land purchase only after, and partly in light of,\nlearning the preferences of his wife. This little thought experiment\nis plausible, but not ideal as an illustration because it is easily\nconflated with vague notions we might entertain about fusion\nof agency in the ideal of marriage\u2014and it is important to\ndistinguish the dynamics of preference conditionalization in teams of\ndistinct agents from the simple collapse of individual\nagency. So let us construct a better example, drawn from\n Hofmeyr and Ross (2019).\n Imagine a corporate Chairperson consulting her risk-averse Board\nabout whether they should pursue a dangerous hostile takeover bid.\nCompare two possible procedures she might use: in process (i) she\nsends each Board member an individual e-mail about the idea a week\nprior to the meeting; in process (ii) she springs it on them\ncollectively at the meeting. Most people will agree that the\ntwo processes might yield different outcomes, and that a main reason\nfor this is that on process (i), but not (ii), some members might\nentrench personal opinions that they would not have time to settle\ninto if they received information about one another\u2019s\nwillingness to challenge the Chair in public at the same time as they\nheard the proposal for the first time. In both imagined processes\nthere are, at the point of voting, sets of individual preferences to\nbe aggregated by the vote. But it is more likely that some preferences\nin the set generated by the second process were conditional\non preferences of others. A conditional preference as Stirling defines\nit is a preference (over actions) that is influenced by information\nabout the preferences (over actions) of (specified) others.\n\nA second notion formalized in Stirling\u2019s theory is\nconcordance. This refers to the extent of controversy or\ndiscord to which a set of preferences, including a set of conditional\npreferences, would generate if equilibrium among them were\nimplemented. Members or leaders of teams do not always want to\nmaximize concordance by engineering all internal games as Assurance or\nHi-lo (though they will always likely want to eliminate PDs). For\nexample, a manager might want to encourage a degree of competition\namong profit centers in a firm, while wanting the cost centers to\nidentify completely with the team as a whole.\n\nStirling formally defines representation theorems for three kinds of\nordered utility functions: conditional utility, concordant utility and\nconditional concordant utility. These may be applied recursively, i.e.\nto individuals, to teams and to teams of teams. Then the core of the\nformal development is the theory that aggregates individuals\u2019\nconditional concordant preferences to build models of team choice that\nare not exogenously imposed on team members, but instead derive from\ntheir several preferences. In stating Stirling\u2019s aggregation\nprocedure in the present context, it is useful to change his\nterminology, and therefore paraphrase him rather than quote directly.\nThis is because Stirling refers to \u201cgroups\u201d rather than to\n\u201cteams\u201d. Stirling\u2019s initial work on CGT was entirely\nindependent of Bacharach\u2019s work,so was not configured within the\ncontext of team reasoning (or what we might reinterpret as\nteam-centred choice). But Bacharach\u2019s ideas provide a natural\nsetting in which to frame Stirling\u2019s technical achievement as an\nenrichment of the applicability of game theory in social science (see\n Hofmeyr and Ross (2019)).\n We can then paraphrase his five constraints on aggregation as\nfollows:\n\n\n(1) Conditioning: A team member\u2019s preference ordering\nmay be influenced by the preferences of other team members, i.e. may\nbe conditional. (Influence may be set to zero, in which case the\nconditional preference ordering collapses to the categorical\npreference ordering to standard RPT.)\n\n(2) Endogeny: A concordant ordering for a team must be\ndetermined by the social interactions of its sub-teams. (This\ncondition ensures that team preferences are not simply imposed on\nindividual preferences.)\n\n(3) Acyclicity: Social influence relations are not\nreciprocal. (This will likely look at first glance to be a strange\nrestriction: surely most social influence relationships, among people\nat any rate, are reciprocal. But, as noted earlier, we need\nto keep conditional preference distinct from agent fusion, and this\ncondition helps to do that. More importantly, as a matter of\nmathematics it allows teams to be represented in directed graphs. The\ncondition is not as restrictive, where modeling flexibility is\nconcerned, as one might at first think, for two reasons. First, it\nonly bars us from representing an agent \\(j\\) influenced by another\nagent \\(i\\) from directly influencing \\(i\\). We are free to\nrepresent \\(j\\) as influencing \\(k\\) who in turn influences \\(i\\).)\nSecond, and more importantly, in light of the exchangeability\nconstraint below, aggregation is insensitive to the ordering of pairs\nof players between whom there is a social influence relationship.)\n\n(4) Exchangeability: Concordant preference orderings are\ninvariant under representational transformations that are equivalent\nwith respect to information about conditional preferences.\n\n(5) Monotonicity: If one sub-team prefers choice alternative\n\\(A\\) to \\(B\\) and all other sub-teams are indifferent between \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\), then the team does not prefer \\(B\\) to \\(A\\).\n\n\nUnder these restrictions, Stirling proves an aggregation theorem which\nfollows a general result for updating utility in light of new\ninformation that was developed by\n Abbas (2003, Other Internet Resources).\n Individual team members each calculate the team preference by\naggregating conditional concordant preferences. Then the analyst\napplies marginalization. Let \\(X^n\\) be a team. Let\n\\(X^m=\\{X_{j1},\\ldots,X_{jm}\\}\\) and \\(X = \\{X_{i1},\\ldots, X_{ik}\\}\\)\nbe disjoint sub-teams of \\(X^n\\). Then the marginal concordant utility\nof \\(X^m\\) with respect to the sub-team \\(\\{X^m, X^k\\}\\) is obtained\nby summing over \\(\\mathcal{A}^k\\), yielding  \n\\[\nU_{x_m}(\\alpha_m) = \\sum_{\\alpha_k} Ux_m x_k (\\alpha_m, \\alpha_k)\n\\]\n\n\nand the marginal utility of the individual team member \\(X_i\\) is\ngiven by  \n\\[\nU_{x_m}(\\alpha_m) = \\sum_{\\sim \\mathbb{a}_i} Ux_n (\\mathbb{a}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbb{a}_n)\n\\]\n\n\nwhere the notation \\(\\sum_{\\sim \\mathbb{a}_i}\\) means that the sum is\ntaken over all arguments except \\(\\mathbb{a}_i\\)\n (Stirling (2012),\n p. 62). This operation produces the non-conditional\npreferences of individual \\(i\\) ex post\u2014that is, updated in\nlight of her conditional concordant preferences and the information on\nwhich they are conditioned, namely, the conditional concordant\npreferences of the team. Once all ex post preferences of agents have\nbeen calculated, the resulting games in which they are involved can be\nsolved by standard analysis.\n\nStirling\u2019s construction is, as he says, a true generalization of\nstandard utility theory so as to make non-conditioned\n(\u201ccategorical\u201d) utility a special case. It provides a\nbasis for formalization of team utility, which can be compared with\nany of the following: the pre-conditioned categorical utility of an\nindividual or sub-team; the conditional utility of an individual or\nsub-team; or the conditional concordant utility of an individual or\nsub-team. Once every individual\u2019s preferences in a team choice\nproblem have been marginalized, NE, SPE or QRE analyses can be\nproposed as solutions to the problem given full information about\nsocial influences. Situations of incomplete information can be solved\nusing Byes-Nash or sequential equilibrium.\n\nIn case the reader has struggled to follow the overall point of the\ntechnical constructions above, we can summarize the achievement of\nconditional game theory (CGT) in higher-level terms as follows. CGT\nmodels the propagation of influence flows by applying the formal\nsyntax of probability theory (through the operation of\nmarginalization) to game theory, and constructing graph theoretical\nrepresentations. As social influence propagates through a group and\nplayers modulate their preferences on the basis of other\nplayers\u2019 preferences, a group preference may emerge. Group\npreferences are not a direct basis for action, but encapsulate a\nsocial model incorporating the relationships and interdependencies\namong the agents. CGT shows us how to derive a coordination ordering\nfor a group which combines the conditional and categorical preferences\nof its members, in much the same way as, in probability theory, the\njoint probability of an event is determined by conditional and\nmarginal probabilities. So, just as the conventional application of\nthe probability syntax is a means of expressing a cognizer\u2019s\nepistemological uncertainty regarding belief, so extending this syntax\nto game theory allows us to represent an agent\u2019s practical\nuncertainty regarding preference.\n\nThe key achievement of this initial interpretation of CGT lies in\nrepresenting the influence of concordance considerations on\nequilibrium determination. The social model can be used to generate an\noperational definition of group preference, and to define truly\ncoordinated choices. There is no assumption that groups necessarily\noptimize their preferences or that individual agents always coordinate\ntheir choices. The point is merely that we can formally represent\nconditions under which agents in games can do what actual people often\nseem to: adapt and settle their individual preferences in\nlight both of what others prefer, and of what promotes a group\u2019s\nstability and efficiency. Team agency is thus incorporated into game\ntheory instead of being left as an exogenous psychological construct\nthat the analyst must investigate in advance of building a\ngame-theoretic model of socially embedded agents.\n\nBecause agents in a CGT analysis condition their preferences on\nactions rather than on outcomes, conditional games cannot be\nrepresented in extensive form. (An extensive-form model must derive\nutility indices at all non-terminal nodes from those assigned to the\nterminal nodes, i.e., to outcomes.) A game theorist should therefore\nconceive of team utility as resulting from a pre-play\nprocess, a concept extensively used in the literature on learning in\ngames, as discussed in\n Section 3.1.\n In that literature, pre-play is used for generating commonly observed\nsignals that are the basis for identification of correlated equilibria\nin \u2018real\u2019 play. This raises an interesting possibility:\nmight we be able to use CGT for that same purpose?\n\nThere is a philosophical reason why we might want to. In a standard\nmodel of learning in a game, players are naturally interpreted as\ninferring private preferences and beliefs of others from observations\nof actions. This comports intuitively with the idea, which has been\nvery popular in cognitive science, that humans achieve their special\n(by comparison with other animals) feats of complex coordination in\npart because we have capacities to \u2018read\u2019 one\nanother\u2019s minds\n (Nichols and Stich 2003).\n However, this hypothesis has recently come under strong critical\nchallenge, from two closely related directions.\n\nFirst, it incorporates the highly questionable idea that beliefs and\npreferences are \u2018inner\u2019 (brain?) states that can be known\nfrom the inside but only inferred from the outside. Cognitive\nscientists are increasingly coming around to the view, first developed\nin detail by\n Dennett (1987),\n and since extended by (among many others)\n Clark (1997)\n and\n Hutto (2008),\n that beliefs and preferences are socially constructed interpretations\nof people\u2019s behavior conditioned on their circumstances and\nhistories, which children are taught to apply automatically, first to\nothers and then to themselves\n (McGeer 2001,\n 2002). Game-theoretic reasoning explains why this\nconstruction is universal practice among humans: it is the essential\nbasis of coordination on what really matters for practical purposes,\nwhich are not people\u2019s specific thoughts but\nprojects into which they can mutually recruit one another\n (Ross 2005a).\n Second,\n Zawidzki (2013)\n argues persuasively that the kinds of rapid inferences presupposed by\nmindreading theory are not computationally feasible except among\npeople who know one another very closely, or are interacting within\ntightly constrained institutional rules, such as playing a team sport\nor transacting in an established market (so, just the kinds of\nsettings where team reasoning is most plausible). So how do people\ncoordinate, at least much of the time, so smoothly? This apparently\nintractable problem dissolves once we take on board the point of the\npreceding paragraph, that people do not need to infer\n\u2018hidden\u2019 beliefs and preferences because there are no such\nthings in the first place. Instead, they co-construct beliefs\nand preferences on the fly through ongoing micro-negotiations. A\nparadigm case is two people avoiding a collision on a crowded\nsidewalk. I don\u2019t need to try to infer which way you intend to\nveer while you simultaneously attempt a similar inference about my\nintention; instead, we exchange quick signals that allow us to jointly\ncreate complementary plans. (In some cultures we may be aided by\nnormative conventions, such as that if one person is a man and the\nother is a woman, the man is to step in the direction of the street.\nThis norm, where it works, may have sexist origins, but it might not\nbe abandoned among people who come to recognize that, because it is\nuseful to have some convention, and this one, where it\napplies, can be used on the basis of quick glances. One can imagine\ngender-fluid people extending it to be cued by how they happen to be\ndressed, perhaps with some smiling and laughing to signal richer\nshared awareness.) Zawidzki refers to such processes as\nmindshaping, and shows that they are the basis of most\nquotidian coordination success. Mindreading, where it can occur, is\nparasitic on mindshaping.\n\nMindshaping clearly has a strategic dimension, as revealed by the fact\nthat it frequently involves micro-scale power dimensions\u2014if it\nis your boss you are at risk of bumping into, or a police officer, you\nmight step backwards instead of to one side. Therefore, game theory\nshould apply to it. But this is problematic in light of the fact that\napplications of standard game theory require that utilities be\npre-specified. The reader should immediately see that CGT seems built\nto order for this challenge.\n\nCGT as it is presented in\n Stirling (2012)\n needs some modification to serve as a game-theoretic model of\nmindshaping. In Stirling\u2019s original intended setting for AI,\ncontrol is hierarchical, and influence on preferences therefore can\nflow from an origin through a network to terminating values.\nMindshaping processes, however, are typically multi-directional.\n Ross and Stirling (2021)\n therefore propose the application of so-called \u2018Markov-chain\nmodeling\u2019, which exploits the mathematical isomorphism between\nCGT and the theory of Bayesian networks, to incorporate influence\nflows without fixed direction. Because this relaxes a property that an\nAI engineer would likely prefer to keep fixed, what is proposed is\neffectively a new theory. Ross and Stirling therefore refer to it as\n\u2018CGT 2.0\u2019. A first application of it, to analysis of\nexperimental games for identifying norms used by laboratory subjects,\nand for estimating the influence of norms on subjects\u2019 behavior,\ncan be found in\n Ross, Stirling, and Tummolini (2023).\n\nCGT 2.0, unlike CGT 1.0, is not best conceptualised as a way of\nformalizing team utility. Its reach is broader. In effect it is a\ngeneral model of any pre-play that facilitates identification of\nutility functions by players with incomplete information. Therefore,\nas shown by\n Ross and Stirling (2023),\n it can be used to identify correlated equilibrium (see\n Section 3.1).\n In fact, it yields something stronger. The \u2018Harsanyi\nDoctrine\u2019is the name of the idea, from\n Harsanyi (1977),\n that any differences in subjective probability assignments by\nBayesian players should result exclusively from different information.\nThis depends only on observations of actions, not on observations of\noutcomes. Since CGT conditions on actions, the transition matrices\nthat represent results of CGT pre-play also identify shared signals\nthat constitute common priors for \u2018real\u2019 play. Therefore,\ninsofar as CGT 2.0 successfully models mindshaping, we can say that\nthe mindshaping hypothesis motivates confidence in the empirical\nrelevance of the Harsanyi Doctrine to at least some behavioral games.\nThis gives formal expression to Zawidzki\u2019s contention that\nmindshaping can strongly support coordination, including in strategic\nsettings. Finally, a limitation of correlated equilibrium for\nempirical purposes is that it relies on the assumption that all\nplayers conform with, and know that all conform with, the axioms of\nExpected Utility Theory.\n Aumann (1987)\n notes that this assumption breaks down if agents operate with\nsubjective probability weightings on beliefs. But this is in fact how\nmajorities of human laboratory subjects do behave\n (Harrison and Ross (2016)).\n CGT 2.0 allows this restriction to be defused by pre-play. It\nincorporates the theory of subjective probability weighting as\ndeveloped by\n Quiggin (1982)\n and\n Prelec (1998)\n in its general model of utility. Such beliefs are therefore reflected\nin the transition matrices that represent the knowledge that licenses\napplication of the Harsanyi Doctrine to \u2018real\u2019 play. The\nderivation of correlated equilibrium can therefore proceed as if\nplayers were expected utility maximizers.\n6. Commitment\n\nIn some games, a player can improve her outcome by taking an action\nthat makes it impossible for her to take what would be her best action\nin the corresponding simultaneous-move game. Such actions are referred\nto as commitments, and they can serve as alternatives to\nexternal enforcement in games which would otherwise settle on\nPareto-inefficient equilibria.\n\nConsider the following hypothetical example (which is not a\nPD). Suppose you own a piece of land adjacent to mine, and I\u2019d\nlike to buy it so as to expand my lot. Unfortunately, you don\u2019t\nwant to sell at the price I\u2019m willing to pay. If we move\nsimultaneously\u2014you post a selling price and I independently give\nmy agent an asking price\u2014there will be no sale. So I might try\nto change your incentives by playing an opening move in which I\nannounce that I\u2019ll build a putrid-smelling sewage disposal plant\non my land beside yours unless you sell, thereby inducing you to lower\nyour price. I\u2019ve now turned this into a sequential-move game.\nHowever, this move so far changes nothing. If you refuse to sell in\nthe face of my threat, it is then not in my interest to carry it out,\nbecause in damaging you I also damage myself. Since you know this you\nshould ignore my threat. My threat is incredible, a case of\ncheap talk.\n\nHowever, I could make my threat credible by committing\nmyself. For example, I could sign a contract with some farmers\npromising to supply them with treated sewage (fertilizer) from my\nplant, but including an escape clause in the contract releasing me\nfrom my obligation only if I can double my lot size and so put it to\nsome other use. Now my threat is credible: if you don\u2019t sell,\nI\u2019m committed to building the sewage plant. Since you know this,\nyou now have an incentive to sell me your land in order to escape its\nruination.\n\nThis sort of case exposes one of many fundamental differences between\nthe logic of non-parametric and parametric maximization. In parametric\nsituations, an agent can never be made worse off by having more\noptions. (Even if a new option is worse than the options with which\nshe began, she can just ignore it.) But where circumstances are\nnon-parametric, one agent\u2019s strategy can be influenced in\nanother\u2019s favour if options are visibly restricted.\nCortez\u2019s burning of his boats (see\n Section 1)\n is, of course, an instance of this, one which serves to make the\nusual metaphor literal.\n\nAnother example will illustrate this, as well as the applicability of\nprinciples across game-types. Here we will build an imaginary\nsituation that is not a PD\u2014since only one player has an\nincentive to defect\u2014but which is a social dilemma insofar as its\nNE in the absence of commitment is Pareto-inferior to an outcome that\nis achievable with a commitment device. Suppose that two of\nus wish to poach a rare antelope from a national park in order to sell\nthe trophy. One of us must flush the animal down towards the second\nperson, who waits in a blind to shoot it and load it onto a truck. You\npromise, of course, to share the proceeds with me. However, your\npromise is not credible. Once you\u2019ve got the buck, you have no\nreason not to drive it away and pocket the full value from it. After\nall, I can\u2019t very well complain to the police without getting\nmyself arrested too. But now suppose I add the following opening move\nto the game. Before our hunt, I rig out the truck with an alarm that\ncan be turned off only by punching in a code. Only I know the code. If\nyou try to drive off without me, the alarm will sound and we\u2019ll\nboth get caught. You, knowing this, now have an incentive to wait for\nme. What is crucial to notice here is that you prefer that I\nrig up the alarm, since this makes your promise to give me my share\ncredible. If I don\u2019t do this, leaving your promise\nincredible, we\u2019ll be unable to agree to try the crime\nin the first place, and both of us will lose our shot at the profit\nfrom selling the trophy. Thus, you benefit from my preventing you from\ndoing what\u2019s optimal for you in a subgame.\n\nWe may now combine our analysis of PDs and commitment devices in\ndiscussion of the application that first made game theory famous\noutside of the academic community. The nuclear stand-off between the\nsuperpowers during the Cold War was intensively studied by the first\ngeneration of game theorists, many of whom received direct or indirect\nfunding support from the US military.\n Poundstone 1992\n provides the relatively \u2018sanitized\u2019 history of this\ninvolvement that has long been available to the casual historian who\nrelies on secondary sources in addition to theorists\u2019 public\nreminiscences. Recently, a more skeptically alert and professional\nhistorical study has been produced by\n Amadae (2016),\n which provides scholarly context for the still more hair-raising\nmemoir of a pioneer of applied game theory, participant in the\ndevelopment of Cold War nuclear strategy, and famous leaker of the\nPentagon\u2019s secret files on the Vietnam War, Daniel Ellsberg\n (Ellsberg 2017).\n History consistent with these accounts but stimulating less pupil\ndilation in the reader is\n Erickson (2015).\n \n\nIn the conventional telling of the tale, the nuclear stand-off between\nthe USA and the USSR attributes the following policy to both parties.\nEach threatened to answer a first strike by the other with a\ndevastating counter-strike. This pair of reciprocal strategies, which\nby the late 1960s would effectively have meant blowing up the world,\nwas known as \u2018Mutually Assured Destruction\u2019, or\n\u2018MAD\u2019. Game theorists at the time objected that MAD was\nmad, because it set up a PD as a result of the fact that the\nreciprocal threats were incredible. The reasoning behind this\ndiagnosis went as follows. Suppose the USSR launches a first strike\nagainst the USA. At that point, the American President finds his\ncountry already destroyed. He doesn\u2019t bring it back to life by\nnow blowing up the world, so he has no incentive to carry out his\noriginal threat to retaliate, which has now manifestly failed to\nachieve its point. Since the Russians can anticipate this, they should\nignore the threat to retaliate and strike first. Of course, the\nAmericans are in an exactly symmetric position, so they too should\nstrike first. Each power recognizes this incentive on the part of the\nother, and so anticipates an attack if they don\u2019t rush to\npreempt it. What we should therefore expect, because it is the only NE\nof the game, is a race between the two powers to be the first to\nattack. The clear implication is the destruction of the world.\n\nThis game-theoretic analysis caused genuine consternation and fear on\nboth sides during the Cold War, and is reputed to have produced some\nstriking attempts at setting up strategic commitment devices. Some\nanecdotes, for example, allege that President Nixon had the CIA try to\nconvince the Russians that he was insane or frequently drunk, so that\nthey\u2019d believe that he\u2019d launch a retaliatory strike even\nwhen it was no longer in his interest to do so. Similarly, the Soviet\nKGB is sometimes claimed, during Brezhnev\u2019s later years, to to\nhave fabricated medical reports exaggerating the extent of his\nsenility with the same end in mind. Even if these stories aren\u2019t\ntrue, their persistent circulation indicates understanding of the\nlogic of strategic commitment. Ultimately, the strategic symmetry that\nconcerned the Pentagon\u2019s analysts was complicated and perhaps\nbroken by changes in American missile deployment tactics. They\nequipped a worldwide fleet of submarines with enough missiles to\nlaunch a devastating counterattack by themselves. This made the\nreliability of the US military communications network less\nstraightforward, and in so doing introduced an element of\nstrategically relevant uncertainty. The President probably could be\nless sure to be able to reach the submarines and cancel their orders\nto attack if prospects of American survival had become hopeless. Of\ncourse, the value of this in breaking symmetry depended on the\nRussians being aware of the potential problem. In Stanley\nKubrick\u2019s classic film Dr. Strangelove, the world is\ndestroyed by accident because the Soviets build a doomsday machine\nthat will automatically trigger a retaliatory strike regardless of\ntheir leadership\u2019s resolve to follow through on the implicit MAD\nthreat but then keep it a secret. As a result, when an\nunequivocally mad American colonel launches missiles at Russia on his\nown accord, and the American President tries to convince his Soviet\ncounterpart that the attack was unintended, the latter sheepishly\ntells him about the secret doomsday machine. Now the two leaders can\ndo nothing but watch in dismay as the world is blown up due to a\ngame-theoretic mistake.\n\nThis example of the Cold War standoff, while famous and of\nconsiderable importance in the history of game theory and its popular\nreception, relied at the time on analyses that weren\u2019t very\nsubtle. The military game theorists were almost certainly mistaken to\nthe extent that they modeled the Cold War as a one-shot PD in the\nfirst place. For one thing, the nuclear balancing game was enmeshed in\nlarger global power games of great complexity. For another, it is far\nfrom clear that, for either superpower, annihilating the other while\navoiding self-annihilation was in fact the highest-ranked outcome. If\nit wasn\u2019t, in either or both cases, then the game wasn\u2019t a\nPD. A cynic might suggest that the operations researchers on both\nsides were playing a cunning strategy in a game over funding, one that\ninvolved them cooperating with one another in order to convince their\npoliticians to allocate more resources to weapons. \n\nIn more mundane circumstances, most people exploit a ubiquitous\ncommitment device that Adam Smith long ago made the centerpiece of his\ntheory of social order: the value to people of their own\nreputations. Even if I am secretly stingy, I may wish to\ncause others to think me generous by tipping in restaurants, including\nrestaurants in which I never intend to eat again. The more I do this\nsort of thing, the more I invest in a valuable reputation which I\ncould badly damage through a single act of obvious, and observed,\nmean-ness. Thus my hard-earned reputation for generosity functions as\na commitment mechanism in specific games, itself enforcing continued\nre-investment. In time, my benevolence may become habitual, and\nconsequently insensitive to circumstantial variations, to the point\nwhere an analyst has no remaining empirical justification for\ncontinuing to model me as having a preference for stinginess. There is\na good deal of evidence that the hyper-sociality of humans is\nsupported by evolved biological dispositions (found in most but not\nall people) to suffer emotionally from negative gossip and the fear of\nit. People are also naturally disposed to enjoy gossiping,\nwhich means that punishing others by spreading the news when their\ncommitment devices fail is a form of social policing they don\u2019t\nfind costly and happily take up. A nice feature of this form of\npunishment is that it can, unlike (say) hitting people with sticks, be\nwithdrawn without leaving long-term damage to the punished. This is a\nhappy property of a device that has as its point the maintenance of\nincentives to contribute to joint social projects; collaboration is\ngenerally more fruitful with team-mates whose bones aren\u2019t\nbroken. Thus forgiveness conventions also play a strategic role in\nthis elegant commitment mechanism that natural selection built for us.\nA \u2018forgiveness convention\u2019 is itself an instance of a\nnorm, as discussed in\n Section 4,\n and a community\u2019s norms provide crucial social scaffolding for\nreputation management. As an approximate generalization, people as\nthey move into adulthood choose between investments in one of three\nbroad kinds of reputational profiles: (i) upholder of most majority\nnorms (which may involve preference falsification), (ii)\ndiscriminating upholder of mixes of majority and novel, minority norms\n(a \u2018trendsetter\u2019, to use the terminology of\n Bicchieri (2017)),\n or (iii) individualistic rebel. People tend to find all three of\nthese normative personality types decipherable, which is the crucial\nrequirement for a useful reputation. The idea of a useful\nreputation should be distinguished from the idea of a generally\napproved reputation. Trendsetters and rebels are typically widely\ndisapproved of, but this can itself help them to avoid games in which\nthey would have to choose between undermining their reputations and\nearning low material payoffs; social disapprobation typically helps\ntrendsetters and rebels coordinate with one another.\nReligious stories, or philosophical ones involving Kantian moral\n\u2018rationality\u2019, are especially likely to be told in\nexplanation of norms because the underlying game-theoretic basis\ndoesn\u2019t occur to people; and the norms in question may function\nto support reputations more effectively for that very reason, because\nthe religious or philosophical stories hide the extent to which\nreputations are under individuals\u2019 strategic control.\n(Existentialist philosophers call this mechanism \u2018bad\nfaith\u2019). The stories trigger sincere emotions, particularly\nanger, which are direct commitment mechanisms that mutually reinforce\nthe investment value of reputations.\n\nThough the so-called \u2018moral emotions\u2019are extremely useful\nfor maintaining commitment, they are not necessary for it. Larger\nhuman institutions are, famously, highly morally obtuse; however,\ncommitment is typically crucial to their functional logic. For\nexample, a government tempted to negotiate with terrorists to secure\nthe release of hostages on a particular occasion may commit to a\n\u2018line in the sand\u2019 strategy for the sake of maintaining a\nreputation for toughness intended to reduce terrorists\u2019\nincentives to launch future attacks. A different sort of example is\nprovided by Qantas Airlines of Australia. Qantas has never suffered a\nfatal accident, and for a time (until it suffered some embarrassing\nnon-fatal accidents to which it likely feared drawing attention) made\nmuch of this in its advertising. This means that its planes, at least\nduring that period, probably were safer than average even if\nthe initial advantage was merely a bit of statistical good fortune,\nbecause the value of its ability to claim a perfect record rose the\nlonger it lasted, and so gave the airline continuous incentives to\nincur greater costs in safety assurance. It likely still has incentive\nto take extra care to prevent its record of fatalities from crossing\nthe magic reputational line between 0 and 1.\n\nCertain conditions must hold if reputation effects are to underwrite\ncommitment. A person\u2019s reputation can have a standing value\nacross a range of games she plays, but in that case her concern for\nits value should be factored into payoffs in specifying each specific\ngame into which she enters. Reputation can be built up\nthrough play of a game only in a case of a repeated game.\nThen the value of the reputation must be greater to its cultivator\nthan the value to her of sacrificing it in any particular\nround of the repeated game. Thus players may establish commitment by\nreducing the value of each round so that the temptation to defect in\nany round never gets high enough to constitute a hard-to-resist\ntemptation. For example, parties to a contract may exchange their\nobligations in small increments to reduce incentives on both sides to\nrenege. Thus builders in construction projects may be paid in weekly\nor monthly installments. Similarly, the International Monetary Fund\noften dispenses loans to governments in small tranches, thereby\nreducing governments\u2019 incentives to violate loan conditions once\nthe money is in hand; and governments may actually prefer such\narrangements in order to remove domestic political pressure for\nnon-compliant use of the money. Of course, we are all familiar with\ncases in which the payoff from a defection in a current round becomes\ntoo great relative to the longer-run value of reputation to future\ncooperation, and we awake to find that the society treasurer has\nabsconded overnight with the funds. Commitment through concern for\nreputation is the cement of society, but any such natural bonding\nagent will be far from perfectly effective.\n7. Evolutionary Game Theory\n\nGintis (2009b,\n 2009b) feels justified in stating that \u201cgame theory is a\nuniversal language for the unification of the behavioral\nsciences.\u201d There are good examples of such unifying work.\nBinmore\n (1998,\n 2005a) models history of increasing social complexity as a\nseries of convergences on increasingly efficient equilibria in\ncommonly encountered transaction games, interrupted by episodes in\nwhich some people try to shift to new equilibria by moving off stable\nequilibrium paths, resulting in periodic catastrophes. (Stalin, for\nexample, tried to shift his society to a set of equilibria in which\npeople cared more about the future industrial, military and political\npower of their state than they cared about their own lives. He was not\nsuccessful in the long run; however, his efforts certainly created a\nsituation in which, for a few decades, many Soviet people attached far\nless importance to other people\u2019s lives than usual.) A\ngame-theoretic perspective indeed seems pervasively useful in\nunderstanding phenomena across the full range of social sciences. In\n Section 4,\n for example, we considered Lewis\u2019s recognition that each human\nlanguage amounts to a network of Nash equilibria in coordination games\naround conveyance of information.\n\nGiven his work\u2019s vintage, Lewis restricted his attention to\nstatic game theory, in which agents are modeled as deliberately\nchoosing strategies given exogenously fixed\nutility-functions. As a result of this restriction, his account\ninvited some philosophers to pursue a misguided quest for a general\nanalytic theory of the rationality of conventions (as noted by\n Bickhard 2008).\n Though Binmore has criticized this focus repeatedly through a\ncareer\u2019s worth of contributions (see the references for a\nselection),\n Gintis (2009a)\n has recently isolated the underlying problem with particular clarity\nand tenacity. NE and SPE are brittle solution concepts when\napplied to naturally evolved computational mechanisms like animal\n(including human) brains. As we saw in\n Section 3\n above, in coordination (and other) games with multiple NE, what it is\neconomically rational for a player to do is highly sensitive to the\nlearning states of other players. In general, when players find\nthemselves in games where they do not have strictly dominant\nstrategies, they only have uncomplicated incentives to play NE or SPE\nstrategies to the extent that other players can be expected to find\ntheir NE or SPE strategies. Can a general theory of\nstrategic rationality, of the sort that philosophers have sought, be\nreasonably expected to cover the resulting contingencies? Resort to\nBayesian reasoning principles, as we reviewed in\n Section 3.1,\n is the standard way of trying to incorporate such uncertainty into\ntheories of rational, strategic decision. However, as\n Binmore (2009)\n argues following the lead of\n Savage (1954),\n Bayesian principles are only plausible as principles of\nrationality itself in so-called \u2018small worlds\u2019, that\nis, environments in which distributions of risk are quantified in a\nset of known and enumerable parameters, as in the solution to our\nriver crossing game from\n Section 3.\n In large worlds, where utility functions, strategy sets and\ninformational structure are difficult to estimate and subject to\nchange by contingent exogenous influences, the idea that Bayes\u2019s\nrule tells players how to \u2018be rational\u2019 is quite\nimplausible. But then why should we expect players to choose NE or SPE\nor sequential-equilibrium strategies in wide ranges of social\ninteractions?\n\nAs\n Binmore (2009)\n and\n Gintis (2009a)\n both stress, if game theory is to be used to model actual, natural\nbehavior and its history, outside of the small-world settings on which\nmicroeconomists (but not macroeconomists or political scientists or\nsociologists or philosophers of science) mainly traffic, then we need\nsome account of what is attractive about equilibria in games even when\nno analysis can identify them by taming all uncertainty in such a way\nthat it can be represented as pure risk. To make reference again to\nLewis\u2019s topic, when human language developed there was no\nexternal referee to care about and arrange for Pareto-efficiency by\nproviding focal points for coordination. Yet somehow people agreed,\nwithin linguistic communities, to use roughly the same words and\nconstructions to say similar things. It seems unlikely that any\nexplicit, deliberate strategizing on anyone\u2019s part played a role\nin these processes. Nevertheless, game theory has turned out to\nfurnish the essential concepts for understanding stabilization of\nlanguages. This is a striking point of support for Gintis\u2019s\noptimism about the reach of game theory. To understand it, we must\nextend our attention to evolutionary games.\n\nGame theory has been fruitfully applied in evolutionary biology, where\nspecies and/or genes are treated as players, since pioneering work by\n Maynard Smith (1982)\n and his collaborators. Evolutionary (or dynamic) game theory\nsubsequently developed into a significant mathematical extension, with\nseveral distinct sub-extensions, applicable to many settings apart\nfrom the biological.\n Skyrms (1996)\n uses evolutionary game theory to try to answer questions Lewis could\nnot even ask, about the conditions under which language, concepts of\njustice, the notion of private property, and other non-designed,\ngeneral phenomena of interest to philosophers would be likely to\narise. What is novel about evolutionary game theory is that moves are\nnot chosen through deliberation by the individual agents. Instead,\nagents are typically hard-wired with particular strategies, and\nsuccess for a strategy is defined in terms of the number of copies of\nitself that it will leave to play in the games of succeeding\ngenerations, given a population in which other strategies with which\nit acts are distributed at particular frequencies. In this kind of\nproblem setting, the strategies themselves are the players, and\nindividuals who play these strategies are their relatively blind\nexecutors, who receive the immediate-run costs and benefits associated\nwith outcomes not because they choose the outcomes in question, but\nbecause ancestors from whom they inherited their strategic\ndispositions recurrently benefited from the outcomes of their\nsimilar games.\n\nThe discussion here will closely follow Skyrms\u2019s. This involves\na restriction in generality. Reference was made above to evolutionary\ngame theory as including \u2018distinct sub-extensions\u2019. What\nwas meant by that is that, like classical game theory, it features a\nplurality of \u2018solution\u2019 concepts. Strictly speaking, these\nare different concepts of dynamic stability, which is a\ndifferent idea of equilibrium from the economic equilibrium notion\nrepresented by classical game-theoretic literal solution\nconcepts. An extensive literature (see immediately below) maps the\nstability concepts for evolutionary games onto the classical solution\nconcepts. Reviewing the range of stability concepts would involve\nredundancy in the present context, because that is the main task of a\nsister entry in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy by J.\nMcKenzie Alexander:\n Game Theory, Evolutionary.\n This complements a fuller exposition with emphasis on philosophical\nissues in\n Alexander (2023),\n which in turn rests on formal foundations reviewed in classic texts\nby\n Weibull (1995)\n and\n Samuelson (1997).\n The Skyrms analysis summarized here relies on just one of the\nstability concepts, the replicator dynamics.\n\nConsider how natural selection works to change lineages of animals,\nmodifying, creating and destroying species. The basic mechanism is\ndifferential reproduction. Any animal with heritable\nfeatures that increase its expected relative frequency of\noffspring in a population of organisms will tend to increase in\nprevalence so long as the environment remains relatively stable. These\noffspring will typically inherit the features in question (with some\nvariation due to mutations, and some variation in frequencies due to\nstatistical noise). Therefore, the proportion of these features in the\npopulation will gradually increase as generations pass. Some of these\nfeatures may go to fixation, that is, eventually take over\nthe entire population (until the environment changes).\n\nHow does game theory enter into this? Often, one of the most important\naspects of an organism\u2019s environment will be the behavioural\ntendencies of other organisms. We can think of each lineage as\n\u2018trying\u2019 to maximize its reproductive fitness (i.e.,\nfuture frequencies of its distinctive genetic structures) through\nfinding strategies that are optimal given the strategies of other\nlineages. So evolutionary theory is another domain of application for\nnon-parametric analysis.\n\nIn evolutionary game theory, we no longer think of individuals as\nchoosing strategies as they move from one game to another. This is\nbecause our interests are different. We\u2019re now concerned less\nwith finding the equilibria of single games than with discovering\nwhich equilibria are stable, and how they will change over time. So we\nnow model the strategies themselves as playing against each\nother. One strategy is \u2018better\u2019 than another if it is\nlikely to leave more copies of itself in the next generation, when the\ngame will be played again. We study the changes in distribution of\nstrategies in the population as the sequence of games unfolds.\n\nFor the replicator dynamics, we introduce a new dynamic stability\n(\u2018equilibrium\u2019) concept, due to\n Maynard Smith (1982).\n A set of strategies, in some particular proportion (e.g., 1/3:2/3,\n1/2:1/2, 1/9:8/9, 1/3:1/3:1/6:1/6\u2014always summing to 1) is at an\nESS (Evolutionary Stable Strategy) equilibrium just in case\n(1) no individual playing one strategy could improve its reproductive\nfitness by switching to one of the other strategies in the proportion,\nand (2) no mutant playing a different strategy altogether could\nestablish itself (\u2018invade\u2019) in the population.\n\nThe principles of evolutionary game theory are best explained through\nexamples. Skyrms begins by investigating the conditions under which a\nsense of justice\u2014understood for purposes of his specific\nanalysis as a disposition to view equal divisions of resources as fair\nunless efficiency considerations suggest otherwise in special\ncases\u2014might arise. He asks us to consider a population in which\nindividuals regularly meet each other and must bargain over resources.\nBegin with three types of individuals:\n\nFairmen always demand exactly half the resource.\nGreedies always demand more than half the resource. When\na greedy encounters another greedy, they waste the resource in\nfighting over it.\nModests always demand less than half the resource. When a\nmodest encounters another modest, they take less than all of the\navailable resource and waste some.\n\n\nEach single encounter where the total demands sum to 100% is\na NE of that individual game. Similarly, there can be many dynamic\nequilibria. Suppose that Greedies demand 2/3 of the resource and\nModests demand 1/3. Then, given random pairing for interaction, the\nfollowing two proportions are ESSs: \n\nHalf the population is greedy and half is modest. We can calculate\nthe average payoff here. Modest gets 1/3 of the resource in every\nencounter. Greedy gets 2/3 when she meets Modest, but nothing when she\nmeets another Greedy. So her average payoff is also 1/3. This is an\nESS because Fairman can\u2019t invade. When Fairman meets Modest he\ngets 1/2. But when Fairman meets Greedy he gets nothing. So his\naverage payoff is only 1/4. No Modest has an incentive to change\nstrategies, and neither does any Greedy. A mutant Fairman arising in\nthe population would do worst of all, and so selection will not\nencourage the propagation of any such mutants.\nAll players are Fairmen. Everyone always gets half the resource,\nand no one can do better by switching to another strategy. Greedies\nentering this population encounter Fairmen and get an average payoff\nof 0. Modests get 1/3 as before, but this is less than Fairman\u2019s\npayoff of 1/2.\n\n\nNotice that equilibrium (i) is inefficient, since the average payoff\nacross the whole population is smaller. However, just as inefficient\noutcomes can be NE of static games, so they can be ESSs of\nevolutionary ones. \n\nWe refer to equilibria in which more than one strategy occurs as\npolymorphisms. In general, in Skyrms\u2019s game, any\npolymorphism in which Greedy demands \\(x\\) and Modest demands \\(1-x\\)\nis an ESS. The question that interests the student of justice concerns\nthe relative likelihood with which these different equilibria\narise.\n\nThis depends on the proportions of strategies in the original\npopulation state. If the population begins with more than one Fairman,\nthen there is some probability that Fairmen will encounter each other,\nand get the highest possible average payoff. Modests by themselves do\nnot inhibit the spread of Fairmen; only Greedies do. But Greedies\nthemselves depend on having Modests around in order to be viable. So\nthe more Fairmen there are in the population relative to\npairs of Greedies and Modests, the better Fairmen do on\naverage. This implies a threshold effect. If the proportion of Fairmen\ndrops below 33%, then the tendency will be for them to fall to\nextinction because they don\u2019t meet each other often enough. If\nthe population of Fairmen rises above 33%, then the tendency will be\nfor them to rise to fixation because their extra gains when they meet\neach other compensates for their losses when they meet Greedies. You\ncan see this by noticing that when each strategy is used by 33% of the\npopulation, all have an expected average payoff of 1/3. Therefore, any\nrise above this threshold on the part of Fairmen will tend to push\nthem towards fixation.\n\nThis result shows that and how, given certain relatively general\nconditions, justice as we have defined it can arise\ndynamically. The news for the fans of justice gets more cheerful still\nif we introduce correlated play (not to be confused with the\ncorrelated equilibrium concept mentioned in\n Section 3.1\n and elsewhere in this article).\n\nThe model we just considered assumes that strategies are not\ncorrelated, that is, that the probability with which every strategy\nmeets every other strategy is a simple function of their relative\nfrequencies in the population. We now examine what happens in our\ndynamic resource-division game when we introduce correlation. Suppose\nthat Fairmen have a slight ability to distinguish and seek out other\nFairmen as interaction partners. In that case, Fairmen on average do\nbetter, and this must have the effect of lowering their threshold for\ngoing to fixation.\n\nAn evolutionary game modeler studies the effects of correlation and\nother parametric constraints by means of running large computer\nsimulations in which the strategies compete with one another, round\nafter round, in the virtual environment. The starting proportions of\nstrategies, and any chosen degree of correlation, can simply be set in\nthe program. One can then watch its dynamics unfold over time, and\nmeasure the proportion of time it stays in any one equilibrium. These\nproportions are represented by the relative sizes of the basins of\nattraction for different possible equilibria. Equilibria are\nattractor points in a dynamic space; a basin of attraction for each\nsuch point is then the set of points in the space from which the\npopulation will converge to the equilibrium in question.\n\nIn introducing correlation into his model, Skyrms first sets the\ndegree of correlation at a very small .1. This causes the basin of\nattraction for equilibrium (i) to shrink by half. When the degree of\ncorrelation is set to .2, the polymorphic basin reduces to the point\nat which the population starts in the polymorphism. Thus very small\nincreases in correlation produce large proportionate increases in the\nstability of the equilibrium where everyone plays Fairman. A small\namount of correlation is a reasonable assumption in most populations,\ngiven that neighbours tend to interact with one another and to mimic\none another (either genetically or because of tendencies to\ndeliberately copy each other), and because genetically and culturally\nsimilar animals are more likely to live in common environments. Thus\nif justice can arise at all it will tend to be dominant and\nstable.\n\nMuch of political philosophy consists in attempts to produce deductive\nnormative arguments intended to convince an unjust agent that she has\nreasons to act justly. Skyrms\u2019s analysis suggests a quite\ndifferent approach. Fairman will do best of all in the dynamic game if\nhe takes active steps to preserve correlation. Therefore, there is\nevolutionary pressure for both moral approval of justice and\njust institutions to arise. Most people may think that\n50\u201350 splits are \u2018fair\u2019, and worth maintaining by\nmoral and institutional reward and sanction, because we are\nthe products of a dynamic game that promoted our tendency to think\nthis way.\n\nThe topic that has received most attention from evolutionary game\ntheorists is altruism, defined as any behaviour by an\norganism that decreases its own expected fitness in a single\ninteraction but increases that of the other interactor. It is arguably\ncommon in nature. How can it arise, however, given Darwinian\ncompetition?\n\nSkyrms studies this question using the dynamic Prisoner\u2019s\nDilemma as his example. This is simply a series of PD games played in\na population, some of whose members are defectors and some of whom are\ncooperators. Payoffs, as always in evolutionary games, are measured in\nterms of expected numbers of copies of each strategy in future\ngenerations.\n\nLet \\(\\mathbf{U}(A)\\) be the average fitness of strategy \\(A\\) in the\npopulation. Let \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) be the average fitness of the whole\npopulation. Then the proportion of strategy \\(A\\) in the next\ngeneration is just the ratio \\(\\mathbf{U}(A)/\\mathbf{U}\\). So if \\(A\\)\nhas greater fitness than the population average \\(A\\) increases. If\n\\(A\\) has lower fitness than the population average then \\(A\\)\ndecreases.\n\nIn the dynamic PD where interaction is random (i.e., there\u2019s no\ncorrelation), defectors do better than the population average as long\nas there are cooperators around. This follows from the fact that, as\nwe saw in\n Section 2.4,\n defection is always the dominant strategy in a single game. 100%\ndefection is therefore the ESS in the dynamic game without\ncorrelation, corresponding to the NE in the one-shot static PD.\n\nHowever, introducing the possibility of correlation radically changes\nthe picture. We now need to compute the average fitness of a strategy\ngiven its probability of meeting each other possible\nstrategy. In the evolutionary PD, cooperators whose probability\nof meeting other cooperators is high do better than defectors whose\nprobability of meeting other defectors is high. Correlation thus\nfavours cooperation.\n\nIn order to be able to say something more precise about this\nrelationship between correlation and cooperation (and in order to be\nable to relate evolutionary game theory to issues in decision theory,\na matter falling outside the scope of this article), Skyrms introduces\na new technical concept. He calls a strategy adaptively\nratifiable if there is a region around its fixation point in the\ndynamic space such that from anywhere within that region it will go to\nfixation. In the evolutionary PD, both defection and cooperation are\nadaptively ratifiable. The relative sizes of basins of attraction are\nhighly sensitive to the particular mechanisms by which correlation is\nachieved. To illustrate this point, Skyrms builds several\nexamples.\n\nOne of Skyrms\u2019s models introduces correlation by means of a\nfilter on pairing for interaction. Suppose that in round 1 of\na dynamic PD individuals inspect each other and interact, or not,\ndepending on what they find. In the second and subsequent rounds, all\nindividuals who didn\u2019t pair in round 1 are randomly paired. In\nthis game, the basin of attraction for defection is large\nunless there is a high proportion of cooperators in round\none. In this case, defectors fail to pair in round 1, then get paired\nmostly with each other in round 2 and drive each other to extinction.\nA model which is more interesting, because its mechanism is less\nartificial, does not allow individuals to choose their partners, but\nrequires them to interact with those closest to them. Because of\ngenetic relatedness (or cultural learning by copying) individuals are\nmore likely to resemble their neighbours than not. If this (finite)\npopulation is arrayed along one dimension (i.e., along a line), and\nboth cooperators and defectors are introduced into positions along it\nat random, then we get the following dynamics. Isolated cooperators\nhave lower expected fitness than the surrounding defectors and are\ndriven locally to extinction. Members of groups of two cooperators\nhave a 50% probability of interacting with each other, and a 50%\nprobability of each interacting with a defector. As a result, their\naverage expected fitness remains smaller than that of their\nneighbouring defectors, and they too face probable extinction. Groups\nof three cooperators form an unstable point from which both extinction\nand expansion are equally likely. However, in groups of four or more\ncooperators at least one encounter of a cooperator with a cooperator\nsufficient to at least replace the original group is guaranteed. Under\nthis circumstance, the cooperators as a group do better than the\nsurrounding defectors and increase at their expense. Eventually\ncooperators go almost to fixation\u2014but nor quite. Single\ndefectors on the periphery of the population prey on the cooperators\nat the ends and survive as little \u2018criminal communities\u2019.\nWe thus see that altruism can not only be maintained by the dynamics\nof evolutionary games, but, with correlation, can even spread and\ncolonize originally non-altruistic populations.\n\nDarwinian dynamics thus offers qualified good news for cooperation.\nNotice, however, that this holds only so long as individuals are stuck\nwith their natural or cultural programming and can\u2019t re-evaluate\ntheir utilities for themselves. If our agents get too smart and\nflexible, they may notice that they\u2019re in PDs and would each be\nbest off defecting. In that case, they\u2019ll eventually drive\nthemselves to extinction\u2014unless they develop stable, and\neffective, norms that work to reinforce cooperation. But, of course,\nthese are just what we would expect to evolve in populations of\nanimals whose average fitness levels are closely linked to their\ncapacities for successful social cooperation. Even given this, these\npopulations will go extinct unless they care about future generations\nfor some reason. But there\u2019s no non-sentimental reason that\ndoesn\u2019t already presuppose altruistic morality as to why agents\nshould care about future generations if each new generation\nwholly replaces the preceding one at each change of cohorts. For this\nreason, economists use \u2018overlapping generations\u2019 models\nwhen modeling intertemporal distribution games. Individuals in\ngeneration 1 who will last until generation 5 save resources for the\ngeneration 3 individuals with whom they\u2019ll want to cooperate;\nand by generation 3 the new individuals care about generation 6; and\nso on.\n\nGintis (2009a)\n argues that when we set out to use evolutionary game theory to unify\nthe behavioral sciences, we should begin by using it to unify game\ntheory itself. We have pointed out at several earlier points in the\npresent article that NE and SPE are problematic solution concepts in\nmany applications where stable norms or explicit institutional rules\nare missing because agents only have incentives to play NE or SPE to\nthe extent that they are confident that other agents will do likewise.\nTo the extent that agents do not have such confidence, what should be\npredicted is general disorder and social confusion. But now we can\npull together a number of strands from earlier sections. From\n Aumann (1974),\n we have the result that correlated equilibrium can solve this problem\nfor Bayesian learners under certain conditions. Gintis makes this\nconcrete by imagining the presence of what he calls a\n\u2018choreographer\u2019. Evolutionary game theory shows how a\nDarwinian selection process can serve as such a choreographer.\n\nBut then where intelligent strategic agents, such as humans, are\nconcerned, the natural choreographer can be usurped, because the\nagents might aim to optimize utility functions where the arguments do\nnot correspond to the fitness criteria on which their selection\nhistory operated. Then the players need equilibrium selection\nmechanisms of some kind to avoid miscoordination. Cultural evolution,\nanother Darwinian selection process, might provide them with norms\nthat serve as focal points. This is not sufficient to ensure\napplication of the Harsanyi Doctrine, which is needed to ensure\nidentification of correlated equilibrium\n (Aumann 1987).\n A main problem is that norms can unravel if they depend on preference\nfalsification. But people can negotiate new norms on the fly through\nmindshaping. Conditional game theory (2.0) provides one model of the\nstrategic aspect of such mindshaping, which also allows players to\nlearn about one another\u2019s systematic departures from expected\nutility theory and thus recover the conditions for the Harsanyi\nDoctrine to apply.\n\nBut, of course, real humans often encounter one another as cultural\nstrangers, who \u2018play for real\u2019 without prior opportunities\nfor fully informative pre-play. When we wonder about the value of\ngame-theoretic models in application to human behavior outside of\nwell-structured markets or tightly regulated institutional settings,\nmuch hinges on what we take to be plausible and empirically validated\nsources of coordinated information and beliefs. When and how can we\nsuppose that people have incentives to access such information and\nbeliefs, which typically involves costs? This has been a subject of\nextensive recent debate, which we will review in\n Section 8.3\n below.\n8. Game Theory and Behavioral Evidence\n\nIn earlier sections, we reviewed some problems that arise from\ntreating classical (non-evolutionary) game theory as a normative\ntheory that tells people what they ought to do if they wish to be\nrational in strategic situations. The difficulty, as we saw, is that\nthere seems to be no one solution concept we can unequivocally\nrecommend for all situations, particularly where agents have private\ninformation. However, in the previous section we showed how appeal to\nevolutionary foundations sheds light on conditions under which utility\nfunctions that have been explicitly formulated by theorists can\nplausibly be applied to groups of people, leading to game-theoretic\nmodels with plausible and stable solutions. So far, however, we have\nnot reviewed any actual empirical evidence from behavioral\nobservations or experiments. Has game theory indeed helped empirical\nresearchers make new discoveries about behavior (human or otherwise)?\nIf so, what in general has the content of these discoveries been?\n\nIn addressing these questions, an immediate epistemological issue\nconfronts us. There is no way of applying game theory \u2018all by\nitself\u2019, independently of other modelling technologies. Using\nterminology standard in the philosophy of science, one can test a\ngame-theoretic model of a phenomenon only in tandem with\n\u2018auxiliary assumptions\u2019 about the phenomenon in question.\nAt least, this follows if one is strict about treating game theory\npurely as mathematics, with no empirical content of its own. In one\nsense, a theory with no empirical content is never open to testing at\nall; one can only worry about whether the axioms on which the theory\nis based are mutually consistent. A mathematical theory can\nnevertheless be evaluated with respect to empirical\nusefulness. One kind of philosophical criticism that has\nsometimes been made of game theory, interpreted as a mathematical tool\nfor modelling behavioral phenomena, is that its application always or\nusually requires resort to false, misleading or badly simplistic\nassumptions about those phenomena. We would expect this criticism to\nhave different degrees of force in different contexts of application,\nas the auxiliary assumptions vary.\n\nSo matters turn out. There is no interesting domain in which\napplications of game theory have been completely uncontroversial.\nHowever, there has been generally easier consensus on how to use game\ntheory (both classical and evolutionary) to understand non-human\nanimal behavior than on how to deploy it for explanation and\nprediction of the strategic activities of people. Let us first briefly\nconsider philosophical and methodological issues that have arisen\naround application of game theory in non-human biology, before\ndevoting fuller attention to game-theoretic social science.\n\nThe least controversial game-theoretic modelling has applied the\nclassical form of the theory to consideration of strategies by which\nnon-human animals seek to acquire the basic resource relevant to their\nevolutionary tournament: opportunities to produce offspring that are\nthemselves likely to reproduce. In order to thereby maximize their\nexpected fitness, animals must find optimal trade-offs among various\nintermediate goods, such as nutrition, security from predation and\nability to out-compete rivals for mates. Efficient trade-off points\namong these goods can often be estimated for particular species in\nparticular environmental circumstances, and, on the basis of these\nestimations, both parametric and non-parametric equilibria can be\nderived. Models of this sort have an impressive track record in\npredicting and explaining independent empirical data on such strategic\nphenomena as competitive foraging, mate selection, nepotism, sibling\nrivalry, herding, collective anti-predator vigilance and signaling,\nreciprocal grooming, and interspecific mutuality (symbiosis). (For\nexamples see\n Krebs and Davies 1984,\n Bell 1991,\n Dugatkin and Reeve 1998,\n Dukas 1998, and\n Noe, van Hoof and Hammerstein 2001.)\n On the other hand, as\n Hammerstein (2003)\n observes, reciprocity, and its exploitation and metaexploitation, are\nmuch more rarely seen in social non-human animals than game-theoretic\nmodeling would lead us to anticipate. One explanation for this\nsuggested by Hammerstein is that non-human animals typically have less\nability to restrict their interaction partners than do people. Our\ndiscussion in the previous section of the importance of correlation\nfor stabilizing game solutions lends theoretical support to this\nsuggestion.\n\nWhy has classical game theory helped to predict non-human animal\nbehavior more straightforwardly than it has done most human behavior?\nThe answer is presumed to lie in different levels of complication\namongst the relationships between auxiliary assumptions and phenomena.\n Ross (2005a)\n offers the following account. Utility optimization problems are the\ndomain of economics. Economic theory identifies the optimizing\nunits\u2014economic agents\u2014with unchanging preference fields.\nIdentification of whole biological individuals with such agents is\nmore plausible the less cognitively sophisticated the organism. Thus\ninsects (for example) are tailor-made for easy application of Revealed\nPreference Theory (see\n Section 2.1).\n As nervous systems become more complex, however, we encounter animals\nthat learn. Learning can cause a sufficient degree of permanent\nmodification in an animal\u2019s behavioral patterns that we can\npreserve the identification of the biological individual with a single\nagent across the modification only at the cost of explanatory\nemptiness (because assignments of utility functions become\nincreasingly ad hoc). Furthermore, increasing complexity confounds\nsimple modeling on a second dimension: cognitively sophisticated\nanimals not only change their preferences over time, but are governed\nby distributed control processes that make them sites of competition\namong internal agents\n (Schelling 1980;\n Ainslie 1992,\n Ainslie 2001).\n Thus they are not straightforward economic agents even at a\ntime. In setting out to model the behavior of people using any part of\neconomic theory, including game theory, we must recognize that the\nrelationship between any given person and an economic agent we\nconstruct for modeling purposes will always be more complicated than\nsimple identity.\n\nThere is no sharp crossing point at which an animal becomes too\ncognitively sophisticated to be modeled as a single economic agent,\nand for all animals (including humans) there are contexts in which we\ncan usefully ignore the synchronic dimension of complexity. However,\nwe encounter a phase shift in modeling dynamics when we turn from\nasocial animals to non-eusocial social ones. (This refers to animals\nthat are social but that don\u2019t, like ants, bees, wasps, termites\nand naked mole rats, achieve cooperation thanks to fundamental changes\nin their population genetics that make individuals within groups into\nnear clones. Some known instances are parrots, corvids, bats, rats,\ncanines, hyenas, pigs, raccoons, otters, elephants, hyraxes,\ncetaceans, and primates.) In their cases stabilization of internal\ncontrol dynamics is partly located outside the individuals,\nat the level of group dynamics. With these creatures, modeling an\nindividual as an economic agent, with a single comprehensive utility\nfunction, is a drastic idealization, which can only be done with the\ngreatest methodological caution and attention to specific contextual\nfactors relevant to the particular modeling exercise. Applications of\ngame theory here can only be empirically adequate to the extent that\nthe economic modeling is empirically adequate.\n\nH. sapiens is the extreme case in this respect. Individual\nhumans are socially controlled to an extreme degree by comparison with\nmost other non-eusocial species. At the same time, their great\ncognitive plasticity allows them to vary significantly between\ncultures. People are thus the least straightforward economic agents\namong all organisms. (It might thus be thought ironic that they were\ntaken, originally and for many years, to be the exemplary instances of\neconomic agency, on account of their allegedly superior\n\u2018rationality\u2019.) We will consider the implications of this\nfor applications of game theory below.\n\nFirst, however, comments are in order concerning the empirical\nadequacy of evolutionary game theory to explain and predict\ndistributions of strategic dispositions in populations of agents. Such\nmodeling is applied both to animals as products of natural selection\n (Hofbauer and Sigmund 1998),\n and to non-eusocial social animals (but especially humans) as\nproducts of cultural selection\n (Boyd and Richerson 1985;\n Young 1998). There are two main kinds of auxiliary assumptions one\nmust justify, relative to a particular instance at hand, in\nconstructing such applications. First, one must have grounds for\nconfidence that the dispositions one seeks to explain are (either\nbiological or cultural, as the case may be)\nadaptations\u2014that is, dispositions that were selected\nand are maintained because of the way in which they promote their own\nfitness or the fitness of the wider system, rather than being\naccidents or structurally inevitable byproducts of other adaptations.\n(See\n Dennett 1995\n for a general discussion of this issue.) Second, one must be able to\nset the modeling enterprise in the context of a justified set of\nassumptions about interrelationships among nested evolutionary\nprocesses on different time scales. (For example, in the case of a\nspecies with cultural dynamics, how does slow genetic evolution\nconstrain fast cultural evolution? How does cultural evolution feed\nback into genetic evolution, if it feeds back at all? For a masterful\ndiscussion of these issues, see\n Sterelny 2003.)\n Conflicting views over which such assumptions should be made about\nhuman evolution are the basis for lively current disputes in the\nevolutionary game-theoretic modeling of human behavioral dispositions\nand institutions. This is where issues in evolutionary game theory\nmeet issues in the booming field of behavioral-experimental\ngame theory. We will therefore first consider the second field before\ngiving a sense of the controversies just alluded to, which now\nconstitute the liveliest domain of philosophical argument in the\nfoundations of game theory and its applications.\n8.1 Game Theory in the Laboratory\n\nEconomists have been testing theories by running laboratory\nexperiments with human and other animal subjects since pioneering work\nby\n Thurstone (1931).\n In recent decades, the volume of such work has become gigantic. The\nvast majority of it sets subjects in microeconomic problem\nenvironments that are imperfectly competitive. Since this is precisely\nthe condition in which microeconomics collapses into game theory, most\nexperimental economics has been experimental game theory. It is thus\ndifficult to distinguish between experimentally motivated questions\nabout the empirical adequacy of microeconomic theory and questions\nabout the empirical adequacy of game theory.\n\nWe can here give only a broad overview of an enormous and complicated\nliterature. Readers are referred to critical surveys in\n Kagel and Roth (1995),\n Camerer (2003),\n Samuelson (2005),\n and the methodological review by\n Guala (2005).\n A useful high-level principle for sorting the literature indexes it\nto the different auxiliary assumptions with which game-theoretic\naxioms are applied. It is often said in popular presentations (e.g.,\n Ormerod 1994)\n that the experimental data generally refute the hypothesis that\npeople are rational economic agents. Such claims are too imprecise to\nbe sustainable interpretations of the results. All data are consistent\nwith the view that people are approximate economic agents, at\nleast for stretches of time long enough to permit game-theoretic\nanalysis of particular scenarios, in the minimal sense that their\nbehavior can be modeled compatibly with Revealed Preference Theory\n(see\n Section 2.1).\n However, RPT makes so little in the way of empirical demands that\nthis is not nearly as surprising as many non-economists suppose\n (Ross 2005a).\n What is really at issue in many of the debates around the general\ninterpretation of experimental evidence is the extent to which people\nare maximizers of expected utility. As we saw in\n Section 3,\n expected utility theory (EUT) is generally applied in tandem with\ngame theory in order to model situations involving\nuncertainty\u2014which is to say, most situations of interest in\nbehavioral science. However, a variety of alternative structural\nmodels of utility lend themselves to Von Neumann-Morgenstern\ncardinalization of preferences and are definable in terms of subsets\nof the\n Savage (1954)\n axioms of subjective utility. The empirical usefulness of game theory\nwould be called into question only if we thought that people\u2019s\nbehavior is not generally describable by means of cardinal vNMufs.\n\nWhat the experimental literature truly appears to show is a world of\nbehavior that is usually noisy from the theorist\u2019s point of\nview. The noise in question arises from substantial heterogeneity,\nboth among people and among (person, situation) vectors. There is no\nsingle structural utility function such that all people act so as to\nmaximize a function of that structure in all circumstances. Faced with\nwell-learned problems in contexts that are not unduly demanding, or\nthat are highly institutionally structured people often behave like\nexpected utility maximizers. For general reviews of theoretical issues\nand evidence, see\n Smith (2008)\n and\n Binmore (2007).\n For an extended sequence of examples of empirical studies, see the\nso-called \u2018continuous double auction\u2019 experiments\ndiscussed in\n Plott and Smith 1978\n and Smith\n 1962,\n 1964,\n 1965,\n 1976,\n 1982.\n As a result, classical game theory can be used in such domains with\nhigh reliability to predict behavior and implement public policy, as\nis demonstrated by the dozens of extremely successful government\nauctions of utilities and other assets designed by game theorists to\nincrease public revenue\n (Binmore and Klemperer 2002).\n\nIn other contexts, interpreting people\u2019s behavior as\ngenerally expected-utility maximizing requires undue violence\nto the need for generality in theory construction. We get better\nprediction using fewer case-specific restrictions if we suppose that\nsubjects are maximizing according to one or (typically) more\nof several alternatives (which will not be described here because they\nare not directly about game theory): rank-dependent utility theory\n (Quiggin 1982,\n Yaari 1987), or alpha-nu utility theory\n (Chew and MacCrimmon 1979).\n The first alternative in fact denotes a family of alternative\nspecifications. One of these, the specification of\n Prelec (1998),\n has emerged in an accumulating mass of empirical estimations as the\nstatistically most useful model of observed human choice under risk\nand uncertainty.\n Harrison and Rutstrom (2008)\n show how to design and code maximum likelihood mixture\nmodels, which allow an empirical modeler to apply a range of\nthese decision functions to a single set of choice data. The resulting\nanalysis identifies the proportion of the total choice set best\nexplained by each model in the mixture.\n Andersen et al (2014)\n take this approach to the current state of the art, demonstrating the\nempirical value of including a model of non-maximizing psychological\nprocesses in a mixture along with maximizing economic models. This\neffective flexibility with respect to the decision modeling that can\nbe deployed in empirical applications of game theory relieves most\npressure to seek adjustments in the game theoretic structures\nthemselves. Thus it fits well with the interpretation of game theory\nas part of the behavioral scientist\u2019s mathematical toolkit,\nrather than as a first-order empirical model of human psychology.\n\nA more serious threat to the usefulness of game theory is evidence of\nsystematic reversal of preferences, in both humans and other animals.\nThis is more serious both because it extends beyond the human case,\nand because it challenges Revealed Preference Theory (RPT) rather than\njust unnecessarily rigid commitment to EUT. As explained in\n Section 2.1,\n RPT, unlike EUT, is among the axiomatic foundations of game theory\ninterpreted non-psychologically. (Not all writers agree that apparent\npreference reversal phenomena threaten RPT rather than EUT; but see\nthe discussions in\n Camerer (1995),\n pp. 660\u2013665, and\n Ross (2005a),\n pp. 177\u2013181.) A basis for preference reversals that seems to be\ncommon in animals with brains is hyperbolic discounting of the\nfuture\n (Strotz 1956,\n Ainslie 1992). This is the phenomenon whereby agents discount future\nrewards more steeply in close temporal distances from the current\nreference point than at more remote temporal distances. This is best\nunderstood by contrast with the idea found in most traditional\neconomic models of exponential discounting, in which there is\na linear relationship between the rate of change in the distance to a\npayoff and the rate at which the value of the payoff from the\nreference point declines. The figure below shows exponential and\nhyperbolic curves for the same interval from a reference point to a\nfuture payoff. The bottom one graphs the hyperbolic function; the\nbowed shape results from the change in the rate of discounting.\n\n\n\nFigure 15\n\n\nA result of this is that, as later prospects come closer to the point\nof possible consumption, people and other animals will sometimes spend\nresources undoing the consequences of previous actions that also cost\nthem resources. For example: deciding today whether to mark a pile of\nundergraduate essays or watch a baseball game, I procrastinate,\ndespite knowing that by doing so I put out of reach some even more fun\npossibility that might come up for tomorrow (when there\u2019s an\nequally attractive ball game on if the better option doesn\u2019t\narise). So far, this can be accounted for in a way that preserves\nconsistency of preferences: if the world might end tonight, with a\ntiny but nonzero probability, then there\u2019s some level of risk\naversion at which I\u2019d rather leave the essays unmarked. The\nfigure below compares two exponential discount curves, the lower one\nfor the value of the game I watch before finishing my marking, and the\nhigher one for the more valuable game I enjoy after completing the\njob. Both have higher value from the reference point the closer they\nare to it; but the curves do not cross, so my revealed preferences are\nconsistent over time no matter how impatient I might be.\n\n\n\nFigure 16\n\n\nHowever, if I bind myself against procrastination by buying a ticket\nfor tomorrow\u2019s game, when in the absence of the awful task I\nwouldn\u2019t have done so, then I\u2019ve violated intertemporal\npreference consistency. More vividly, had I been in a position to\nchoose last week whether to procrastinate today, I\u2019d have chosen\nnot to. In this case, my discount curve drawn from the reference point\nof last week crosses the curve drawn from the perspective of today,\nand my preferences reverse. The figure below shows this situation.\n\n\n\nFigure 17\n\n\nThis phenomenon complicates applications of classical game theory to\nintelligent animals. However, it clearly doesn\u2019t vitiate it\naltogether, since people (and other animals) often\ndon\u2019t reverse their preferences. (If this weren\u2019t\ntrue, the successful auction models and other s-called\n\u2018mechanism designs\u2019 would be mysterious.) Interestingly,\nthe leading theories that aim to explain why hyperbolic discounters\nmight often behave in accordance with RPT themselves appeal to game\ntheoretic principles.\n Ainslie (1992,\n 2001) has produced an account of people as communities of\ninternal bargaining interests, in which subunits based on short-term,\nmedium-term and long-term interests face conflict that they must\nresolve because if they don\u2019t, and instead generate an internal\nHobbesian breakdown\n (Section 1),\n outside agents who avoid the Hobbesian outcome can ruin them all. The\ndevice of the Hobbesian tyrant is unavailable to the brain. Therefore,\nits behavior (when system-level insanity is avoided) is a sequence of\nself-enforcing equilibria of the sort studied by game-theoretic public\nchoice literature on coalitional bargaining in democratic\nlegislatures. That is, the internal politics of the brain consists in\n\u2018logrolling\u2019\n (Stratmann 1997).\n These internal dynamics are then partly regulated and stabilized by\nthe wider social games in which coalitions (people as wholes over\ntemporal subparts of their biographies) are embedded\n (Ross 2005a ,\n pp. 334\u2013353). (For example: social expectations about\nsomeone\u2019s role as a salesperson set behavioral equilibrium\ntargets for the logrolling processes in their brain.) This potentially\nadds further relevant elements to the explanation of why and how\nstable institutions with relatively transparent rules are key\nconditions that help people more closely resemble straightforward\neconomic agents, such that classical game theory finds reliable\napplication to them as entire units.\n\nOne important note of caution is in order here. Much of the recent\nbehavioral literature takes for granted that temporally inconsistent\ndiscounting is the standard or default case for people. However,\n Andersen et al (2008)\n show empirically that this arises from (i) assuming that groups of\npeople are homogenous with respect to which functional forms best\ndescribe their discounting behavior, and (ii) failure to independently\nelicit and control for people\u2019s differing levels of risk\naversion in estimating their discount functions. In a range of\npopulations that have been studied with these two considerations in\nmind, data suggest that temporally consistent discounting describes\nsubstantially higher proportions of choices than does temporally\ninconsistent choices. Over-generalization of hyperbolic discounting\nmodels should thus be avoided. \n8.2 Neuroeconomics and Game Theory\n\nThe idea that game theory can find novel application to the internal\ndynamics of brains, as suggested in the previous section, has been\ndeveloped from independent motivations by the research program known\nas neuroeconomics\n (Montague and Berns 2002,\n Glimcher 2003,\n Ross 2005a,\n pp. 320\u2013334,\n Camerer, Loewenstein and Prelec 2005).\n Thanks to new non-invasive scanning technologies, especially\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), it has recently become\npossible to study synaptic activity in working brains while they\nrespond to controlled cues. This has allowed a new path of\naccess\u2014though still a highly indirect one\n (Harrison and Ross 2010)\u2014\n to the brain\u2019s computation of expected values of rewards, which\nare (naturally) taken to play a crucial role in determining behavior.\nEconomic theory is used to frame the derivation of the functions\nmaximized by synaptic-level computation of these expected values;\nhence the name \u2018neuroeconomics\u2019.\n\nGame theory plays a leading role in neuroeconomics at two levels.\nFirst, game theory has been used to predict the computations that\nindividual neurons and groups of neurons serving the reward system\nmust perform. In the best publicized example,\n Glimcher (2003)\n and colleagues have fMRI-scanned monkeys they had trained to play\nso-called \u2018inspection games\u2019 against computers. In an\ninspection game, one player faces a series of choices either to work\nfor a reward, in which case he is sure to receive it, or to perform\nanother, easier action (\u201cshirking\u201d), in which case he will\nreceive the reward only if the other player (the\n\u201cinspector\u201d) is not monitoring him. Assume that the first\nplayer\u2019s (the \u201cworker\u2019s\u201d) behavior reveals a\nutility function bounded on each end as follows: he will work on every\noccasion if the inspector always monitors and he will shirk on every\noccasion if the inspector never monitors. The inspector prefers to\nobtain the highest possible amount of work for the lowest possible\nmonitoring rate. In this game, the only NE for both players are in\nmixed strategies, since any pattern in one player\u2019s strategy\nthat can be detected by the other can be exploited. For any given pair\nof specific utility functions for the two players meeting the\nconstraints described above, any pair of strategies in which, on each\ntrial, either the worker is indifferent between working and shirking\nor the inspector is indifferent between monitoring and not monitoring,\nis a NE.\n\nApplying inspection game analyses to pairs or groups of agents\nrequires us to have either independently justified their\nutility functions over all variables relevant to their play, in which\ncase we can define NE and then test to see whether they successfully\nmaximize expected utility; or to assume that they maximize\nexpected utility, or obey some other rule such as a matching function,\nand then infer their utility functions from their behavior. Either\nsuch procedure can be sensible in different empirical contexts. But\nepistemological leverage increases greatly if the utility function of\nthe inspector is exogenously determined, as it often is. (Police\nimplementing random roadside inspections to catch drunk drivers, for\nexample, typically have a maximum incidence of drunk driving assigned\nto them as a target by policy, and an exogenously set budget. These\ndetermine their utility function, given a distribution of preferences\nand attitudes to risk among the population of drivers.) In the case of\nGlimcher\u2019s experiments the inspector is a computer, so its\nprogram is under experimental control and its side of the payoff\nmatrix is known. Proxies for the subjects\u2019 expected utility, in\nthis case squirts of fruit juice for the monkeys, can be antecedently\ndetermined in parametric test settings. The computer is then\nprogrammed with the economic model of the monkeys, and can search the\ndata in their behavior in game conditions for exploitable patterns,\nvarying its strategy accordingly. With these variables fixed,\nexpected-utility-maximizing NE behavior by the monkeys can be\ncalculated and tested by manipulating the computer\u2019s utility\nfunction in various runs of the game.\n\nMonkey behavior after training tracks NE very robustly (as does the\nbehavior of people playing similar games for monetary prizes;\n Glimcher 2003,\n pp. 307\u2013308). Working with trained monkeys, Glimcher and\ncolleagues could then perform the experiments of significance here.\nWorking and shirking behaviors for the monkeys had been associated by\ntheir training with staring either to the right or to the left on a\nvisual display. In earlier experiments,\n Platt and Glimcher (1999)\n had established that, in parametric settings, as juice rewards varied\nfrom one block of trials to another, firing rates of each parietal\nneuron that controls eye movements could be trained to encode the\nexpected utility to the monkey of each possible movement relative to\nthe expected utility of the alternative movement. Thus\n\u201cmovements that were worth 0.4 ml of juice were represented\ntwice as strongly [in neural firing probabilities] as movements worth\n0.2 ml of juice\u201d (p. 314). Unsurprisingly, when amounts of juice\nrewarded for each movement were varied from one block of trials to\nanother, firing rates also varied.\n\nAgainst this background, Glimcher and colleagues could investigate the\nway in which monkeys\u2019 brains implemented the tracking of NE.\nWhen the monkeys played the inspection game against the computer, the\ntarget associated with shirking could be set at the optimal location,\ngiven the prior training, for a specific neuron under study, while the\nwork target would appear at a null location. This permitted Glimcher\nto test the answer to the following question: did the monkeys maintain\nNE in the game by keeping the firing rate of the neuron constant while\nthe actual and optimal behavior of the monkey as a whole varied? The\ndata robustly gave the answer \u2018yes\u2019. Glimcher reasonably\ninterprets these data as suggesting that neural firing rates, at least\nin this cortical region for this task, encode expected utility in both\nparametric and nonparametric settings. Here we have an apparent\nvindication of the empirical applicability of classical game theory in\na context independent of institutions or social conventions.\n\nFurther analysis pushed the hypothesis deeper. The computer playing\nInspector was presented with the same sequence of outcomes as its\nmonkey opponent had received on the previous day\u2019s play, and for\neach move was asked to assess the relative expected values of the\nshirking and working actions available on the next move. Glimcher\nreports a positive correlation between small fluctuations around the\nstable NE firing rates in the individual neuron and the expected\nvalues estimated by the computer trying to track the same NE. Glimcher\ncomments on this finding as follows:\n\nThe neurons seemed to be reflecting, on a play-by-play basis, a\ncomputation close to the one performed by our computer \u2026 [A]t a\n\u2026 [relatively] \u2026 microscopic scale, we were able to use\ngame theory to begin to describe the decision-by-decision computations\nthat the neurons in area LIP were performing.\n (Glimcher 2003,\n p. 317)\n\n\nThus we find game theory reaching beyond its traditional role as a\ntechnology for framing high-level constraints on evolutionary dynamics\nor on behavior by well-informed agents operating in institutional\nstraitjackets. In Glimcher\u2019s hands, it is used to directly model\nactivity in a monkey\u2019s brain.\n Ross (2005a)\n argues that groups of neurons thus modeled should not be identified\nwith the sub-personal game-playing units found in Ainslie\u2019s\ntheory of intra-personal bargaining described earlier; that would\ninvolve a kind of straightforward reduction that experience in the\nbehavioral and life sciences has taught us not to expect. This issue\nhas since arisen in a direct dispute between neuroeconomists over\nrival interpretations of fMRI observations of intertemporal choice and\ndiscounting\n (McClure et al. 2004),\n Glimcher et al. 2007). The weight of evidence so far favors the view that if\nit is sometimes useful to analyze people\u2019s choices as equilibria\nin games amongst sub-personal agents, the sub-personal agents in\nquestion should not be identified with separate brain areas. The\nopposite interpretation is unfortunately still most common in less\nspecialized literature. \n\nWe have now seen the first level at which neuroeconomics applies game\ntheory. A second level involves seeking conditioning variables in\nneural activity that might impact people\u2019s choices of strategies\nwhen they play games. This has typically involved repeating protocols\nfrom the behavioral game theory literature with research subjects who\nare lying in fMRI scanners during play.\n Harrison (2008)\n and\n Ross (2008b)\n have argued for skepticism about the value of work of this kind,\nwhich involves various uncomfortably large leaps of inference in\nassociating the observed behavior with specific imputed neural\nresponses. It can also be questioned whether much generalizable new\nknowledge is gained to the extent that such associations can\nbe successfully identified.\n\nLet us provide an example of this kind of \u201cgame in a\nscanner\u201d\u2014that directly involves strategic interaction.\n King-Casas et al. (2005)\n took a standard protocol from behavioral game theory, the so-called\n\u2018trust\u2019 game, and implemented it with subjects whose\nbrains were jointly scanned using a technology for linking the\nfunctional maps of their respective brains, known as\n\u2018hyperscanning\u2019). This game involves two players. In its\nrepeated format as used in the King-Casas et al. experiment,\nthe first player is designated the \u2018investor\u2019 and the\nsecond the \u2018trustee\u2019. The investor begins with $20, of\nwhich she can keep any portion of her choice while investing the\nremainder with the trustee. In the trustee\u2019s hands the invested\namount is tripled by the experimenter. The trustee may then return as\nmuch or as little of this profit to the investor as he deems fit. The\nprocedure is run for ten rounds, with players\u2019 identities kept\nanonymous from one another.\n\nThis game has an infinite number of NE. Previous data from behavioral\neconomics are consistent with the claim that the modal NE in human\nplay approximates both players using\n\u2018Tit-for-tat\u2019 strategies (see\n Section 4)\n modified by occasional defections to probe for information, and some\npost-defection cooperation that manifests (limited) toleration of such\nprobes. This is a very weak result, since it is compatible with a wide\nrange of hypotheses on exactly which variations of Tit-for-tat are\nused and sustained, and thus licenses no inferences about potential\ndynamics under different learning conditions, institutions, or\ncross-cultural transfers.\n\nWhen they ran this game under hyperscanning, the researchers\ninterpreted their observations as follows. Neurons in the\ntrustee\u2019s caudate nucleus (generally thought to implement\ncomputations or outputs of midbrain dopaminergic systems) were thought\nto show strong response when investors benevolently reciprocated\ntrust\u2014that is, responded to defection with increased generosity.\nAs the game progressed, these responses were believed to have shifted\nfrom being reactionary to being anticipatory. Thus reputational\nprofiles as predicted by classical game-theoretic models were inferred\nto have been constructed directly by the brain. A further aspect of\nthe findings not predictable by theoretical modeling alone, and which\npurely behavioral observation had not been sufficient to discriminate,\nwas taken to be that responses by the caudate neurons to malevolent\nreciprocity\u2014that is, reduced generosity in response to\ncooperation\u2014were significantly smaller in amplitude. This was\nhypothesized to be a mechanism by which the brain implements\nmodification of Tit-for-tat so as to prevent occasional defections for\ninformational probing from unraveling cooperation permanently. \n\nThe advance in understanding for which practitioners of this style of\nneuroeconomics hope consists not in what it tells us about particular\ntypes of games, but rather in comparative inferences it facilitates\nabout the ways in which contextual framing influences people\u2019s\nconjectures about which games they\u2019re playing. fMRI or other\nkinds of probes of working brains might, it is conjectured, enable us\nto quantitatively estimate degrees of strategic surprise.\nReciprocally interacting expectations about surprise may themselves be\nsubject to strategic manipulation, but this is an idea that has barely\nbegun to be theoretically explored by game theorists (see\n Ross and Dumouchel 2004).\n The view of some neuroeconomists that we now have the prospect of\nempirically testing such new theories, as opposed to just\nhypothetically modeling them, has stimulated growth in this line of\nresearch.\n8.3 Game Theoretic Models of Human Nature\n\nThe developments reviewed in the previous section bring us up to the\nmoving frontier of experimental / behavioral applications of classical\ngame theory. We can now return to the branch point left off several\nparagraphs back, where this stream of investigation meets that coming\nfrom evolutionary game theory. There is no serious doubt that, by\ncomparison to other non-eusocial animals\u2014including our nearest\nrelatives, chimpanzees and bonobos\u2014humans achieve prodigious\nfeats of coordination (see\n Section 4)\n (Tomasello et al. 2004). A lively controversy, with important philosophical\nimplications and fought on both sides with game-theoretic arguments,\nwent on for some time over whether this capacity can be wholly\nexplained by cultural adaptation, or is better explained by inference\nto a genetic change early in the career of H. sapiens.\n\nHenrich et al.\n (2004,\n 2005) have run a series of experimental games with\npopulations drawn from fifteen small-scale human societies in South\nAmerica, Africa, and Asia, including three groups of foragers, six\ngroups of slash-and-burn horticulturists, four groups of nomadic\nherders, and two groups of small-scale agriculturists. The games\n(Ultimatum, Dictator, Public Goods) they implemented all place\nsubjects in situations broadly resembling that of the Trust game\ndiscussed in the previous section. That is, Ultimatum and Public Goods\ngames are scenarios in which both social welfare and each\nindividual\u2019s welfare are optimized (Pareto efficiency achieved)\nif and only if at least some players use strategies that are not\nsub-game perfect equilibrium strategies (see\n Section 2.6).\n In Dictator games, a narrowly selfish first mover would capture all\navailable profits. Thus in each of the three game types, SPE players\nwho cared only about their own monetary welfare would get outcomes\nthat would involve highly inegalitarian payoffs. In none of the\nsocieties studied by Henrich et al. (or any other society in\nwhich games of this sort have been run) are such outcomes observed.\nThe players whose roles are such that they would take away all but\nepsilon of the monetary profits if they and their partners played SPE\nalways offered the partners substantially more than epsilon, and even\nthen partners sometimes refused such offers at the cost of receiving\nno money. Furthermore, unlike the traditional subjects of experimental\neconomics\u2014university students in industrialized\ncountries\u2014Henrich et al.\u2019s subjects did not even\nplay Nash equilibrium strategies with respect to monetary\npayoffs. (That is, strategically advantaged players offered larger\nprofit splits to strategically disadvantaged ones than was necessary\nto induce agreement to their offers.) Henrich et al.\ninterpret these results by suggesting that all actual people, unlike\n\u2018rational economic man\u2019, value egalitarian outcomes to\nsome extent. However, their experiments also show that this extent\nvaries significantly with culture, and is correlated with variations\nin two specific cultural variables: typical payoffs to cooperation\n(the extent to which economic life in the society depends on\ncooperation with non-immediate kin) and aggregate market integration\n(a construct built out of independently measured degrees of social\ncomplexity, anonymity, privacy, and settlement size). As the values of\nthese two variables increase, game behavior shifts (weakly) in the\ndirection of Nash equilibrium play. Thus the researchers conclude that\npeople are naturally endowed with preferences for egalitarianism, but\nthat the relative weight of these preferences is programmable by\nsocial learning processes conditioned on local cultural cues.\n\nIn evaluating Henrich et al.\u2019s interpretation of these\ndata, we should first note that no axioms of RPT, or of the various\nmodels of decision mentioned in\n Section 8.1,\n which are applied jointly with game theoretic modeling to human\nchoice data, specify or entail the property of narrow selfishness.\n(See\n Ross (2005a)\n ch. 4;\n Binmore (2005b)\n and\n (2009);\n and any economics or game theory text that lets the mathematics speak\nfor itself.) Orthodox game theory thus does not predict that people\nwill play SPE or NE strategies derived by treating their own monetary\npayoffs as equivalent to utility.\n Binmore (2005b)\n is therefore justified in criticizing Henrich et al for\nrhetoric suggesting that their empirical work embarrasses orthodox\ntheory. \n\nThis is not to suggest that the anthropological interpretation of the\nempirical results should be taken as uncontroversial. Binmore\n (1994,\n 1998,\n 2005a,\n 2005b) has argued for many years, based on a wide range of\nbehavioral data, that when people play games with non-relatives they\ntend to learn to play Nash equilibrium with respect to utility\nfunctions that approximately correspond to income functions. As he\npoints out in\n Binmore (2005b),\n Henrich et al.\u2019s data do not test this hypothesis for\ntheir small-scale societies, because their subjects were not exposed\nto the test games for the (quite long, in the case of the Ultimatum\ngame) learning period that theoretical and computational models\nsuggest are required for people to converge on NE. When people play\nunfamiliar games, they tend to model them by reference to games they\nare used to in everyday experience. In particular, they tend to play\none-shot laboratory games as though they were familiar\nrepeated games, since one-shot games are rare in normal\nsocial life outside of special institutional contexts. Many of the\ninterpretive remarks made by Henrich et al. are consistent\nwith this hypothesis concerning their subjects, though they\nnevertheless explicitly reject the hypothesis itself. What is\ncontroversial here\u2014the issues of spin around\n\u2018orthodox\u2019 theory aside\u2014is less about what the\nparticular subjects in this experiment were doing than about what\ntheir behavior should lead us to infer about human evolution.\n\nGintis (2004),\n (2009a) argues that data of the sort we have been discussing\nsupport the following conjecture about human evolution. Our ancestors\napproximated maximizers of individual fitness. Somewhere along the\nevolutionary line these ancestors arrived in circumstances where\nenough of them optimized their individual fitness by acting so as to\noptimize the welfare of their group\n (Sober and Wilson 1998)\n that a genetic modification went to fixation in the species: we\ndeveloped preferences not just over our own individual welfare, but\nover the relative welfare of all members of our communities, indexed\nto social norms programmable in each individual by cultural\nlearning. Thus the contemporary researcher applying game theory to\nmodel a social situation is advised to unearth her subjects\u2019\nutility functions by (i) finding out what community (or communities)\nthey are members of, and then (ii) inferring the utility function(s)\nprogrammed into members of that community (communities) by studying\nrepresentatives of each relevant community in a range of games and\nassuming that the outcomes are correlated equilibria. Since the\nutility functions are the dependent variables here, the games must be\nindependently determined. We can typically hold at least the strategic\nforms of the relevant games fixed, Gintis supposes, by virtue of (a)\nour confidence that people prefer egalitarian outcomes, all else being\nequal, to inegalitarian ones within the culturally evolved\n\u2018insider groups\u2019 to which they perceive themselves as\nbelonging and (b) a requirement that game equilibria are drawn from\nstable attractors in plausible evolutionary game-theoretic models of\nthe culture\u2019s historical dynamics.\n\nRequirement (b) as a constraint on game-theoretic modeling of general\nhuman strategic dispositions is no longer very controversial\u2014or,\nat least, is no more controversial than the generic adaptationism in\nevolutionary anthropology of which it is one expression. However, many\ncommentators are skeptical of Gintis\u2019s suggestion that there was\na genetic discontinuity in the evolution of human sociality. (For a\ncognitive-evolutionary anthropology that explicitly denies such\ndiscontinuity, see\n Sterelny 2003.)\n Based partly on such skepticism (but more directly on behavioral\ndata) Binmore\n (2005a,\n 2005b) resists modeling people as having built-in preferences\nfor egalitarianism. According to Binmore\u2019s\n (1994,\n 1998,\n 2005a)\n model, the basic class of strategic problems facing non-eusocial\nsocial animals are coordination games. Human communities evolve\ncultural norms to select equilibria in these games, and many of these\nequilibria will be compatible with high levels of apparently\naltruistic behavior in some (but not all) games. Binmore argues that\npeople adapt their conceptions of fairness to whatever happen to be\ntheir locally prevailing equilibrium selection rules. However, he\nmaintains that the dynamic development of such norms must be\ncompatible, in the long run, with bargaining equilibria among\nself-regarding individuals. Indeed, he argues that as societies evolve\ninstitutions that encourage what Henrich et al. call\naggregate market integration (discussed above), their utility\nfunctions and social norms tend to converge on self-regarding economic\nrationality with respect to welfare. This does not mean that Binmore\nis pessimistic about the prospects for egalitarianism: he develops a\nmodel showing that societies of broadly self-interested bargainers can\nbe pulled naturally along dynamically stable equilibrium paths towards\nnorms of distribution corresponding to Rawlsian justice\n (Rawls 1971).\n The principal barriers to such evolution, according to Binmore, are\nprecisely the kinds of other-regarding preferences that conservatives\nvalorize as a way of discouraging examination of more egalitarian\nbargaining equilibria that are within reach along societies\u2019\nequilibrium paths.\n\nResolution of this debate between Gintis and Binmore fortunately need\nnot wait upon discoveries about the deep human evolutionary past that\nwe may never have. The models make rival empirical predictions of some\ntestable phenomena. If Gintis is right then there are limits, imposed\nby the discontinuity in hominin evolution, on the extent to which\npeople can learn to be self-regarding. This is the main significance\nof the controversy discussed above over Henrich et\nal.\u2019s interpretation of their field data. Binmore\u2019s\nmodel of social equilibrium selection also depends, unlike\nGintis\u2019s, on widespread dispositions among people to inflict\nsecond-order punishment on members of society who fail to sanction\nviolators of social norms.\n Gintis (2005)\n shows using a game theory model that this is implausible if\npunishment costs are significant. However,\n Ross (2008a)\n argues that the widespread assumption in the literature that\npunishment of norm-violation must be costly results from failure to\nadequately distinguish between models of the original evolution of\nsociality, on the one hand, and models of the maintenance and\ndevelopment of norms and institutions once an initial set of them has\nstabilized. Finally, Ross also points out that Binmore\u2019s\nobjectives are as much normative as descriptive: he aims to show\negalitarians how to diagnose the errors in conservative\nrationalisations of the status quo without calling for revolutions\nthat put equilibrium path stability (and, therefore, social welfare)\nat risk. It is a sound principle in constructing reform proposals that\nthey should be \u2018knave-proof\u2019 (as Hume put it), that is,\nshould be compatible with less altruism than might prevail in\npeople.\n9. Looking Ahead: Areas of Current Innovation\n\nIn 2016 the Journal of Economic Perspectives published a\nsymposium on \u201cWhat is Happening in Game Theory?\u201d Each of\nthe participants noted independently that game theory has become so\ntightly entangled with microeconomic theory in general that the\nquestion becomes difficult to distinguish from inquiry into the moving\nfrontier of that entire sub-discipline, which is in turn the largest\npart of economics as a whole. Thus the boundary between the\nphilosophy of game theory and the philosophy of\nmicroeconomics is now similarly indistinct. Of course, as has been\nstressed, applications of game theory extend beyond the traditional\ndomain of economics, into all of the behavioral and social sciences.\nBut as the methods of game theory have fused with the methods of\nmicroeconomics, a commentator might equally view these extensions as\nbeing exported applications of microeconomics.\n\nFollowing decades of development (incompletely) surveyed in the\npresent article, the past few years have been relatively quiet ones\nwhere foundational innovations of the kind that invite contributions\nfrom philosophers are concerned. Some parts of the original\nfoundations are being newly revisited, however.\n\nvon Neumann and Morgenstern\u2019s (1944)\n introduction of game theory divided the inquiry into two parts.\nNoncooperative game theory analyzes cases built on the\nassumption that each player maximizes her own utility function while\ntreating the expected strategic responses of other players as\nconstraints. As discussed above, the specific game to which von\nNeumann and Morgenstern applied their modeling was poker, which is a\nzero-sum game. Most of the present article has focused on the many\ntheoretical challenges and insights that arose from extending\nnoncooperative game theory beyond the zero-sum domain. But this in\nfact develops only half of von Neumann and Morgenstern\u2019s\nclassic. The other half developed cooperative game theory,\nabout which nothing has so far been said here. The reason for this\nsilence is that for most game theorists cooperative game theory is a\ndistraction at best and at worst a technology that confuses\nthe point of game theory by bypassing the aspect of games that mainly\nmakes them potentially interesting and insightful in application,\nnamely, the requirement that equilibria be selected endogenously under\nthe restrictions imposed by\n Nash (1950a).\n This, after all, is what makes equilibria self-enforcing, just in the\nway that prices in competitive markets are, and thus renders them\nstable unless shocked from outside.\n Nash (1953)\n argued that solutions to cooperative games should always be verified\nby showing that they are also solutions to formally equivalent\nnoncooperative games. Nash\u2019s accomplishment in the paper wa the\nanalytical identification of the relevant equivalence. One way of\ninterpreting this was as demonstrating the ultimate redundancy of\ncooperative game theory. \n\nCooperative game theory begins from the assumption that players have\nalready, by some unspecified process, agreed on a vector of\nstrategies, and thus on an outcome. Then the analyst deploys the\ntheory to determine the minimal set of conditions under which the\nagreement remains stable. The idea is typically illustrated by the\nexample of a parliamentary coalition. Suppose that there is one\ndominant party that must be a member of any coalition if it is to\ncommand a majority of parliamentary votes on legislation and\nconfidence. There might then be a range of alternative possible\ngroupings of other parties that could sustain it. Imagine, to make the\nexample more structured and interesting, that some parties will not\nserve in a coalition that includes certain specific others; so the\nproblem faced by the coalition organizers is not simply a matter of\nsumming potential votes. The cooperative game theorist identifies the\nset of possible coalitions. There may be some other parties, in\naddition to the dominant party, that turn out to be needed in every\npossible coalition. Identifying these parties would, in this example,\nreveal the core of the game, the elements shared by all\nequilibria. The core is the key solution concept of cooperative game\ntheory, for which Shapley shared the Nobel prize.\n (Shapley (1953)\n is the great paper.)\n Nash (1953)\n defined the \u201cNash program\u201d as consisting of verifying a\nparticular cooperative equilibrium by showing that noncooperative\nplayers could arrive at it through the sequential bargaining\nprocess specified in\n Nash (1950b),\n and that all outcomes of such bargaining would include the\ncore.\n\nIn light of the example, it is no surprise that political scientists\nwere the primary users of cooperative theory during the years while\nnoncooperative game theory was still being fully developed. It has\nalso been applied usefully by labor economists studying settlement\nnegotiations between firms and unions, and by analysts of\ninternational trade negotiations. We might illustrate the value of\nsuch application by reference to the second example. Suppose that,\ngiven the weight of domestic lobbies in South Africa, the South\nAfrican government will never agree to any trade agreement that does\nnot allow it to protect its automative assembly sector. (This has in\nfact been the case so far.) Then allowance for such protection is part\nof the core of any trade treaty another country or bloc might conclude\nwith South Africa. Knowing this can help the parties during\nnegotiations avoid rhetoric or commitments to other lobbies, in any of\nthe negotiating countries, that would put the core out of reach and\nthus guarantee negotiation failure. This example also helps us\nillustrate the limitations of cooperative game theory. South Africa\nwill have to trade off the interests of some other lobbies to protect\nits automative industry. Which others will get traded off\nwill be a function of the extensive-form play of non-cooperative\nsequential proposals and counter-proposals, and the South African\nbargainers, if they have done their due diligence, must be attentive\nto which paths through the tree throw which specific domestic\ninterests under the proverbial bus. Thus carrying out the cooperative\nanalysis does not relieve them of the need to also conduct the\nnoncooperative analysis. Their game theory consultants might as well\nsimply code the non-cooperative parameters into their Gambit software,\nwhich will output the core if asked.\n\nBut cooperative game theory did not die, or become confined to\npolitical science applications. There has turned out to be a range of\npolicy problems, involving many players whose attributes vary but\nwhose ordinal utility functions are symmetrical, for which\nnoncooperative modeling, while possible in principle, is absurdly\ncumbersome and computationally demanding, but for which cooperative\nmodeling is beautifully suited. That we be dealing with ordinal\nutility functions is important, because in the relevant markets there\nare often no prices. The classic example\n (Gale and Shapley 1962)\n is a marriage market. Abstracting from the scale of individual\nromantic dramas and comedies, society features, as it were, a vast set\nof people who want to form into pairs, but care very much who they end\nup paired with. Suppose we have a finite set of such people. Imagine\nthat the match-maker, or app, first splits the set into two proper\nsubsets, and announces a rule that everyone in subset \\(A\\) will\npropose to someone in subset \\(B\\). Each of those in \\(B\\) who receive\na proposal knows that she is the first choice of someone in \\(A\\). She\nselects her first choice from the proposals she has received and\nthrows the rest back into the pool. Those in \\(A\\) whose initial\nproposals were not accepted now each propose to someone they did not\npropose to before, but possibly including people who are holding\nproposals from a previous round\u2014Nkosi knows that Barbara\npreferred Amalia in round 1, but Nkosi wasn\u2019t part of that\nchoice set and so might displace Amalia in round 2). Provably there\nexists a terminal round after which no further proposals will be made,\nand the matchmaking app will have found the core of the cooperative\ngame because no person \\(i\\) in set \\(B\\) will prefer to pair with\nsomeone from set \\(A\\) who prefers \\(i\\) to whoever is holding that\n\\(A\\)-set dreamboat\u2019s proposal. Everyone from set B will now\naccept the proposal they are holding, and, if the two sets had the\nsame cardinality and everyone would rather pair with someone than pair\nwith no one, then nobody will go off alone.\n\nThis is not a directly applicable model of a marriage market, so there\nis no money to be made in selling the simple matchmaking app described\nabove. The problem is that we have no guarantee that, in the example,\nNkosi and Amalia aren\u2019t one another\u2019s partners of destiny,\nbut cannot get paired because they both began in subset \\(A\\). In game\ntheory textbooks this problem is often finessed by assuming that Set\n\\(A\\) contains men and Set \\(B\\) contains women, and that everyone is\nso committed to heterosexuality that they\u2019d rather pair with\nanyone of the opposite sex than anyone of their own sex. On the other\nhand, the model provides some insight, in the way that models\ntypically do, if we don\u2019t insist on applying it too literally.\nAfter working through it, one sees the logic of facts about society\nthat someone designing a real matchmaking app had better understand:\nthat the app will have to log proposals under consideration but not\nyet accepted, leave people holding proposals under consideration on\nthe market, and remember who has previously rejected whom (without\ncreating a generalised emotional catastrophe by publicly posting this\ninformation). The real app will not be able to reliably find the core\nof the cooperative game, unless the set of people in the market is\nsmall, restricted, and has self-sorted into subsets to at least some\nextent by providing such information as \u201c\\(X\\)-type person seeks\n\\(Y\\)-type person\u201d for \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) properties that everyone\nprioritizes. (Are there such properties, at least as an\napproximation?) But the real matchmaking apps seem to work well enough\nto be transforming the way in which most young people now find mates\nin countries with generally available internet access. Relationships\nbetween theoretically idealized and real marriage markets are\ncomprehensively reviewed in\n Chiappori (2017).\n \n\nThe revival of cooperative game theory as site of renewed interest has\noccurred because policy problems have been encountered that, unlike\nthe original toy illustration using the all-straights marriage market,\nsatisfy the model\u2019s crucial assumptions. Leading instances are\nmatching university applicants and universities, and matching people\nneeding organ transplants with donors (see\n Roth 2015).\n In these markets, there is no ambivalence about partitioning the sets\nto be matched. Ordinal preferences are the relevant ones: universities\ndon\u2019t auction off places to the highest bidder (or at least not\nin general), and organs are not for sale (or at least not legally).\nThe models are really applied, and they demonstrably have improved\nefficiency and saved lives.\n\nIt is common in science for models that are practically clumsy fits to\ntheir original problems to turn out to furnish highly efficient\nsolutions to new problems thrown up by technological change. The\ninternet has created an environment for applications of matching\nalgorithms\u2014travellers and flat renters, diners and restaurants,\nstudents and tutors, and (regrettably) socially alienated people and\npurveyors of propaganda and fanaticism\u2014that could have been\ndesigned by a theorist at any time since Shapley\u2019s original\ninnovations, but would previously have been practically impossible to\nimplement. These applications of cooperative game theory are often\napplied conjointly with the noncooperative game theory of auctions\n (Klemperer 2004)\n to drive market designs for goods and services so efficient as to be\nannihilating the once mighty shopping mall in even the suburban USA.\nWhy are hotels more profitable and easily available than was the case\nin all but the largest cities before about 2007? The answer is that\ndynamic pricing algorithms\n (Gershkov and Moldovanu 2014)\n blend matching theory and auction theory to allow hotels, combined\nwith online travel service aggregators, to find customers willing to\npay premium rates for their ideal locations and times, and then fill\nthe remaining rooms with bargain hunters whose preferences are more\nflexible. Airlines operate similar technology. Game theory thus\ncontinues to be one of the 20th-century inventions that is driving\nsocial revolutions in the 21st, and\n Samuelson (2016)\n predicts a coming surge of renewed interest in the deeper mathematics\nof cooperative games and their relationships to noncooperative games.\n\n\nA range of further applications of both classical and evolutionary\ngame theory have been developed, but we have hopefully now provided\nenough to convince the reader of the tremendous, and constantly\nexpanding, utility of this analytical tool. The reader whose appetite\nfor more has been aroused should find that she now has sufficient\ngrasp of fundamentals to be able to work through the large literature,\nof which some highlights are listed below.",
