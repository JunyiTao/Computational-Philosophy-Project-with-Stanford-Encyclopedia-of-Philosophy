    "main_text": "The New Traditionalism || The Declinist Narrative of the New Traditionalism\n8.1 The Declinist Narrative of the New Traditionalism\n\n\nThose familiar with the work of Alasdair MacIntyre will immediately\nrecognize the New Traditionalists' narrative. For in its broad\nstructure, it bears a close resemblance to the one that MacIntyre tells\nin his three books After Virtue, Whose Justice? Which\nRationality? and Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry\n(MacIntyre 1984, 1988, and 1990,\n respectively).[16]\nThe MacIntyrean\nnarrative is broadly declinist in character, depicting the degeneration\nof Western moral and political thought in the following four\nstages.\n\n\n In the first stage, the New Traditionalists\nmaintain that the late ancient and the high medieval thinkers of the\nwest embraced a unified philosophical vision that includes three\nfundamental components. The first component is a commitment to a\n\u201cthick\u201d teleological account of the human good, according to which\nhuman beings have rational natures that can be perfected. The\nsecond component is a commitment to the claim that virtue consists in\nthe perfection of our rational nature in both its practical and\ntheoretical dimensions. Practical reason, according to the\nvision, can ascertain not merely the means to achieve one's ends, but\nalso the very telos or end for human beings. And theoretical\nreason, so the vision has it, can gain genuine insight into the world\nby viewing the entire created order as participating in or resembling\nthe divine nature. The third component of the vision is that\nmoral thought and discourse should be framed primarily in terms of the\nvirtues\u2014the virtues providing the dominant conceptuality in\nterms of which we conduct moral reasoning. To which it is worth\nadding the following point: advocates of the MacIntyrean narrative do\nnot deny that pre-modern societies had their share of moral, religious,\nand political problems. Their claim is merely that these\nsocieties enjoyed (at least in principle) the shared conceptual\nresources with which they could coherently address and remedy\nthem.\n\n\n In the second stage of the narrative, there\nis a fall into our current fragmented moral and religious\ncondition. Although the New Traditionalists regard different\nmovements and figures as responsible for the fall, they agree on this\nmuch: the philosophical vision that unified the societies of\npre-modernity fell apart. The teleological worldview was replaced\nby a nominalist and mechanistic one. Practical reason became\ninstrumentalized\u2014viewed as merely a \u201cslave of the passions,\u201d to\nuse Hume's phrase. And theoretical reason was conceived of as\nworking in a perfectly adequate fashion apart from any commitment to\nthere being a divinely-ordered reality. Furthermore, the language\nof justice and individual rights supplanted that of virtue. As a\nresult, the state that we now occupy is one in which we no longer enjoy\na shared conception of the good, and politics has become\u2014to use\nMacIntyre's memorable phrase\u2014\u201ccivil war by other means.\u201d\nWithout such a conception of the good, we now face all manner of moral,\nreligious, and political problems that we lack the conceptual resources\nto resolve or even properly understand.\n\n\n In the third stage of the narrative, New\nTraditionalists maintain that liberal democracy emerges as the more or\nless natural political consequence of the fall from the pre-modern\nstate. Liberal democracy, according to the New Traditionalists,\nis not only a political structure that protects putative\nindividual rights (such as to religious freedom), but is also committed\nto a broad thesis of neutrality with respect to notions of God\nand the good. According to this understanding of liberal\ndemocracy, the state should not enact laws that require a religious\nrationale and citizens should therefore comply with the DRR.\nGiven its commitment to neutrality and the DRR, the New Traditionalists\nclaim that liberal democracy is a mode of governance that is\nfundamentally at odds with the type of traditional religious way of\nlife that informed society during its pre-modern state.\n\n\n In the final stage of the narrative, New\nTraditionalists offer proposals of various sorts for how traditionally\nreligious believers should cope with being citizens of a political\nsystem whose fundamental commitments are at odds with their own.\nThe proposals are generally not injunctions to transform the liberal\nstate. Rather, they are broadly separatist in nature, exhorting\ntraditional believers to distance themselves from the liberal state,\nsay, by living in small religious communities, which owe their ultimate\nallegiance to the church or some larger religious tradition. If\nthey are correct, the DRR is both crucial to liberal democracy and an\nimportant reason for traditional believers to reject it.\n",
