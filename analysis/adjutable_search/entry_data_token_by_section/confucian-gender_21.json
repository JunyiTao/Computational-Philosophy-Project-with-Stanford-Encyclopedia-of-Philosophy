    "main_text": "Confucian Feminism: A Hybrid Feminist Theory || Relational Personhood and Dependency Care\n7.3 Relational Personhood and Dependency Care\n\nIt is important to note that the Confucian friendship model is not a\nreplica of the contemporary peer friendship model that is morally\nneutral and is underpinned by an autonomous concept of the self\n(English 1979 [1989]; Dixon 1995). As many contemporary scholars have\nargued, unlike the liberal model of individualism, Confucianism offers\na relational conception of the self whose personhood is deeply\nentrenched in the intertwining of the self and other (Ivanhoe 2007;\nAmes 2011; Rosemont 2015). The Confucian relational personhood is,\nfirst and foremost, grounded in the parent-child relationship, and\nthat Confucian emphasis on the parent-child relationship not only fits\nright into the ongoing feminist discourse on care ethics but also is\nahead of the growing consensus among philosophers that the liberal\nconcept of an autonomous self is a deeply flawed one.\n\nMost feminists, even those anchored in the liberal tradition, have\nbegun to theorize a more robust concept of the self that is relational\nand embodied (Mackenzie 2014). And most feminists have looked past the\n\u201cMan of Reason\u201d as a guide for moral and political theory\n(Lloyd 1984, 2002). In particular, feminists with the rise of care\nethics have begun to take the activity of caring as meriting ethical\ninsights that have long been discarded to the realm of the sentiment,\npersonal, or pre-moral. In contrast, Confucianism not only exalts the\nmoral valence of caring relations, but more importantly recognizes the\npolitical dimension of caring, a critical step that was lacking in the\nearly development of care ethics (Card 1990; Friedman 1993: Ch. 6;\nYuan 2002).\n\nConfucianism understands that interdependency is an existential given\nand hence providing care to vulnerable others in Confucianism is not\nonly a moral response, but also a characteristic political response of\na ren-based benevolent state. For the way of Confucians,\naccording to the competing school of Mo (Mojia), is\ncharacterized by the parental devotion of caring for the newborn\ninfant (Mencius 3A5). Remarkably, in Confucian philosophy,\nthe discussion of caring for the newborn infant occurs not in the\ncontext of the so-called \u201cwomanly sphere\u201d, but instead in\nthe context of state governance.\n\nThe metaphor of caring for the newborn infant in state governance is\nfirst derived from the Book of Documents\n(Shujing):\n\n\nif the king tended to the people as if he were tending to his own\nnewborn infant, then the people would be tranquil and orderly.\n(Shujing, \u201cKangzhao\u201d chapter; for other\ntranslations see Legge 1879).\n\n\nAnd the way to tend to the newborn infant is to be responsive and\nsincere. As the same passage is further elaborated in the Great\nLearning (Daxue):\n\n\nIn the \u201cKangzhao\u201d [of Shujing] it is said,\n\u201cAct as if you were watching over an infant\u201d. If one is\nreally responsively sincere, though one may not exactly hit the mark,\none will not be far from doing so (for other translation see Legge\n1885, Liji, \u201cDaxue\u201d chapter).\n\n\nProviding good care for the most vulnerable is an integral part of\nConfucian political discourse. A kingly state, according to the\nMencius, takes caring for those without the care of a\nfamily\u2014the widower, the widow, the childless, and the\norphan\u2014as its first political consideration (Mencius\n1B5). Similarly, according to the Xunzi in the discussion of\nthe regulation of a king:\n\n\nThose who have one of the Five Illnesses (wuji\n\u4e94\u75be) should be raised up and gathered in so that they can\nbe cared for. They should be given official duties commensurable with\ntheir abilities and employment adequate to feed and clothe themselves\nso that all are included and not even one of them is overlooked.\n(Xunzi 9.1)\n\n\nAccording to the later commentary, the \u201cFive Illnesses\u201d\nhere refers to physical or mental disabilities (Watson 1963: n3,\n34).\n\nUnlike the liberal bifurcation of the family and the state or the\nprivate and the public, the Confucian model provides a relational\nalternative to address the issue of dependency care that has long been\nadvocated by care ethicists (Noddings 1984; Kittay 1999; Held 2006).\nFor, in Confucianism, caring for others is not just constitutive of\none\u2019s moral personhood, but more importantly a political ideal\nthat grounds the state authority in its demonstrated capacity to\nprovide good care for the most vulnerable\u2014the young, the old,\nthe sick, and the disabled\u2014as if one were caring for one\u2019s\nown family. In other words, to care for those who cannot care for\nthemselves beginning in one\u2019s family and then concentrically\nradiating to the world at large has both ethical and political\nimportance in Confucian philosophy.\n",
