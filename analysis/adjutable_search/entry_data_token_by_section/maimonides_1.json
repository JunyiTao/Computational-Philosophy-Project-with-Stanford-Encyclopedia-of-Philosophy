    "main_text": "Fundamental Orientation\n2. Fundamental Orientation\n\n\nMaimonides presents a challenge to the modern reader because his\nview of truth is totally unhistorical. We saw that he was guided by the\nneed to systematize. Given 613 original commandments, he argues that\nall are means to the fulfillment of the first two, which he interprets\nas belief in the existence of God and rejection of\n idolatry.[4]\n Together these commandments make up what we call\nmonotheism. From Maimonides\u2019 perspective, however, there is\nmore to monotheism than belief in a single deity. To satisfy the first\ntwo commandments, one must believe in a timeless, changeless,\nimmaterial deity who is one in every respect and unlike anything in the\ncreated order. A person who fails to recognize such a deity is accorded\nthe status of an idolater no matter how many other commandments she may\nfulfill or how fervently she may fulfill them. Simply put, to worship\nGod under a false description is not to worship God at all. Not only is\nthis true at present, as Maimonides sees it, it has been true since God\nfirst spoke to Adam.\n\n\nEarly in the Guide (1.2), Maimonides argues that Adam is\ndepicted as having the most perfect metaphysical knowledge a human\nbeing can achieve prior to his expulsion from the Garden of Eden. By\nnecessity this would have to include belief in a timeless, changeless,\nimmaterial deity. Even if the biblical text makes no mention of Adam\u2019s\ntheology, Maimonides thinks (MT 14 Kings and Wars, 9.1) it\nwould be impossible for someone to be this close to God and harbor a\nfundamental misunderstanding. Unfortunately Adam\u2019s knowledge was lost\nduring the time of Enosh and had to be rediscovered by Abraham\n(MT 1, Idolatry, 1.1\u20132; GP 3.29). Again Maimonides\nthinks he is justified in saying that Abraham discovered proofs for the\nexistence of a God who is neither a body nor a force in a body even\nthough the Bible is silent on such matters. These proofs were\nsupposedly passed down to Isaac and Jacob but lost during the Egyptian\ncaptivity when the Israelites adopted the pagan beliefs of their\ncaptors.\n\n\nWhen Moses arose to lead the people out of captivity, he faced a\nserious problem. If all he did were to offer philosophic proofs again, the\npeople would forget them just as they had forgotten before. So instead\nof offering proofs alone, he offered the blueprint for a social order\nthat would help the people remember their history and the principles on\nwhich it is founded. That is why in addition to the first two\ncommandments, there are 611 others designed to create an environment in\nwhich people will have the time, health, and mental facility needed to\ngrasp the truth of monotheism (GP 3.27\u201328).\n\n\nJudaism then is based on a particular philosophy. Maimonides\n(GP 1.71) takes this to mean that before Plato and Aristotle\nintroduced science and philosophy to the Greeks, the patriarchs\nintroduced it to Israel. To someone who asks why we have no explicit\nrecord of their philosophy, Maimonides answers that any record of such\nteaching was destroyed when Israel went into exile and suffered\npersecution. So despite the appearance of a split between Jerusalem and\nAthens, Maimonides thinks there is only one tradition worth preserving:\nthat which affirms the truth.\n\n\nHe makes this point in the Introduction to the Guide when\nhe says that what Jewish tradition taught under the guise of\nma\u2019aseh bereishit (the account of the beginning) is what\nGreeks thinkers taught as physics, while what Jewish tradition taught\nunder the guise of ma\u2019aseh merkavah (the account of\n[Ezekiel\u2019s] chariot) is what Greek thinkers taught under the guise of\nmetaphysics. In short, Jewish tradition has always been philosophical.\nThe problem is that these subjects are too difficult for the average\nworshipper to grasp and must be expressed as parables or metaphors that\nthe educated few will interpret at one level and the average worshipper\nat another (Stern 2013).\n\n\nLooking at his own situation, Maimonides concludes that the\ntradition of learning that began in Israel has been lost once again.\nPeople pray to a material God and justify their actions on the basis of\nliteral interpretation. Someone was needed to reverse this situation\nand reintroduce Jews to the teachings of their own tradition. Strictly\nspeaking, such truths are Jewish only in the sense that Jews were the\nfirst to discover them. From an ethnic standpoint, they are no more\nJewish than the Pythagorean theorem is Greek.\n\n\nAll this goes to show that Maimonides did not conceive of progress\nas we do. Although he regarded mastery of science and philosophy as\nessential parts of human perfection, he did not view them as\ncumulative. Rather than take us into new territory, his goal was to\nreacquaint us with the territory that Moses and the patriarchs had\nalready staked out. The important truths do not change. Human progress\nis measured by the degree to which they are identified and understood.\nThat is why the primary function of the Messiah will be to teach these\ntruths and help create conditions in which more people are able to\nreflect on them.\n",
