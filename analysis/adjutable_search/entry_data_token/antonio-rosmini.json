To this purpose, he absorbed the tradition of\nphilosophia perennis, read extensively the works of\npost-Renaissance philosophers, and developed his own views on\nphilosophical fundamentals and many of their applications. Best known\nin Italy, but a controversial figure there during his life and for a\ncentury or more after his death, his philosophical work, centred upon\nthe notion of being and the dignity of the human person, can be\nsummarised under the headings: aims and method, the objectivity of\nthought and the concept of certainty; the dignity of the human person;\nmorality; human rights; the nature of human society; natural theology;\nand being.

Life and Works\n\n\nRosmini was born in 1797 at Rovereto, Italy, a staunchly\nItalian-speaking town, but at the time part of the Austro-Hungarian\nEmpire and ruled from Vienna. The Rosmini family, citizens of Rovereto\nfor several centuries, had become rich through the manufacture of silk,\nand enjoyed the way of life proper to the lesser aristocracy. \nAntonio\u2019s\nprimary and secondary education was, however, catered for at the public\nschool, and through his own intensive reading. Tertiary education was\ncompleted at the University of Padua. After ordination to the\npriesthood in 1821, Rosmini studied and wrote at Rovereto until 1826,\nand from 1826\u201328 at Milan. Despite his instinctive distaste for \nthe\nexcesses of the French Revolution, which inevitably played a large part\nin the cultural formation of persons growing to maturity in the first\nquarter of the 19th century, Rosmini was not afraid to take a stand\nagainst State interference in religious affairs. His \nPanegyric for Pius VII (1823) \nwas considerably censored by the\nAustrian-Hungarian government and published only in 1831. By this time,\nRosmini had founded his religious order (1828), and published at Rome\nhis fundamental philosophical work, \nA New Essay concerning the Origin of Ideas (1830). \nAs the title suggests, this was intended\nto supersede Locke\u2019s famous Essay concerning Human\nUnderstanding. From then on, a torrent of philosophical and\ntheological works poured out until his death at Stresa. From 1836 until\n1855, Rosmini was involved in constant controversy. The approbation of\nhis religious order (1836\u201338), his work on conscience (1840),\ntheological disputes (1843\u201348) and his participation in the \npolitical\nevents of 1848, occasioned strong debate which led in 1849 to the\ninclusion of two of his works, The Five Wounds of Holy Church\nand the Civil Constitution according to Social Justice, in the\nIndex of Prohibited Books. Strengthened by this, \nRosmini\u2019s\ntheological and political opponents pressed for an examination of all\nhis works which led, however, to his exoneration (1854), a year before\nhis death at Stresa in northern Italy (1855). Condemnation came\nposthumously (1888\u20139) when forty propositions, taken mostly from \nbooks\npublished after his death, were included in the decree Post\nObitum of Leo XIII. A remarkable swing in ecclesiastical opinion\ntook place in 2001 when a Vatican Note stated: \u2018The\nmotives for preoccupation and for doctrinal and prudential difficulties\nwhich determined the promulgation of the decree Post Obitum\ncondemning the \u201cForty Propositions\u201d drawn from the works of \nAntonio\nRosmini can now be considered as surmounted\u2019 (CDF,\nOsservatore Romano, 1 July 2001).\n2. Aim and Method\n\n\nRosmini describes his aim and method at some length in his On\nthe Studies of the Author. He sets out to combat error, to\nsystematise the truth, to present a philosophy that can serve as a\nbasis for the various branches of knowledge, and to offer philosophy as\nan aid to theology. To achieve this, he upholds freedom to\nphilosophise, and sets out to reconcile, whenever possible, apparently\ncontrasting views. His intention throughout is to present an image of\nknowledge as one, simple and indivisible.\n2.1 Combating error\n\n\nNo one, he maintains, would err for the sake of erring.\nPhilosophical tradition in particular provides an object lesson in the\nmovement towards truth, and the elimination of error. Nevertheless, the\npath forward is not pursued without error because the movement towards\nhigher levels of reflection takes place unevenly. Responses to\nquestions at level A are no longer adequate in form to resolve\nquestions at level B, which inevitably take on new aspects through\ntheir application to new circumstances. The role of the philosopher is\nto distinguish the form of difficulties, which may vary from age to age\nor generation to generation, and to formulate questions in such a way\nthat it is possible to see both their historical antecedents and the\nunderlying principles to be employed in solving them. The process,\nhowever, will never be complete. The same principles will always cry\nout for application to new cases, and the same struggle to avoid error\nwill ensue.\n2.2 Systematising the truth\n\n\nThe negative task of combating error is not, however, sufficient.\nWhat is needed in addition, says Rosmini, is a \u2018system of\ntruth\u2019, that is, a system which shows clearly how the passage is\nmade from the most general, self-evident principles to more particular\nlevels of knowledge. Knowledge-wise, we move instinctively from the\nmore general to the particular. A mother does not begin by naming\nroses, carnation and other species for her children; she first\nindicates them all as \u2018flowers\u2019 before calling them by\ntheir particular names. So \u2018being\u2019, which is the most\ngeneral of all notions, is the fundamental principle of human\nknowledge which draws together every aspect of being. When\n\u2018being\u2019 is seen as the supreme principle of unity on which\nall knowledge depends, truth\u2014\u2018being as\nknown\u2019\u2014has been systematised and is seen in all its\nbeauty. Since, however, the full application of being is never seen\nonce and for all, it is better to ensure adherence to principle than\nto grasp at unconnected facts which serve at best as a ragbag of\nerudition\u2014better to grasp the principle of the wheel, for\nexample, than to know only a number of its applications.\n2.3 Philosophy as a basis for the various branches of knowledge\n\n\nPhilosophy as \u2018the study of the final reasons\u2019 is thus\ncentral to Rosmini\u2019s understanding. For him, the Enlightenment, with\nits sensistic, subjectivist attitude and devotion to the act of\nreasoning, rather than to the light of reason, degenerates inevitably\ninto a hotchpotch of negation and ignorance, leading to radical\ncorruption in ethics, and every other branch of philosophical\nendeavour.\n2.4 Philosophy as an aid to theology\n\n\nThe fragmentation of philosophy and its consequent separation from\ntheology is, according to Rosmini, a necessary consequence of\nsensationalist thinking. There can be no place for revealed doctrine to\nbe expounded as true science unless certain truths are already\ndemonstrated, in the logical order at least, by philosophical reason.\nOn the other hand, theology itself often cannot make progress unless it\nis prepared to turn to philosophy for assistance. The notions of body,\nof person and of many other matters essential to theology, cannot be\nadequately expressed in isolation from philosophical teaching. In its\nturn, according to Rosmini, divine revelation does not cancel, but\ncompletes and ennobles reason, especially by drawing its attention to\nproblems such as the relationship between person and nature which would\notherwise escape its attention.\n2.5 Freedom to Philosophise\n\n\nError, the antithesis of knowledge, is the only intellectual\nimpediment to free, philosophical thought. From this principle, Rosmini\nconcludes that assent to erroneous prejudices, not assent to prejudice\nas such, is the principal obstacle to be overcome by philosophers.\nTheir work consists in examining preconceptions and determining their\ntruth in order to provide grounds for rational persuasion about what\nthey know. To maintain, as many do, that the possession of some\nunproven truth is inimical to philosophical thought is tantamount to\nrequiring nil knowledge in the prospective philosopher. Rather, a\nperson who knows something, but has not yet come to grips with the\nreasons leading to it, is like a person who knows the answer to a\nproblem, but still has to consider the reason for the answer. In this\ncase, freedom is not constrained. The point at issue, therefore, in the\ncase of religion, is not that Christians, or Buddhists, or Muslims, or\nany other religious persons, are necessarily hampered by their beliefs,\nbut whether these beliefs are true, and to what extent they are true.\nIt is not sufficient to state simply that only persons who are devoid\nof any belief are capable of philosophising freely. Rather\ntotal freedom is a necessary condition of the truth of\nfaith. If faith were considered divine although in conflict with\nreason, it would impose an impossible obligation and totally inhibit\nour reasoning activity. We would be unable to give our assent to either\nreason or faith, and would thus remain deprived of truth (IP\n39 [All numbers in references to Rosmini\u2019s works are to paragraphs, not\nto pages]).\n\n\nIt is not the case, Rosmini would affirm, that only non-believers\nhave the capacity to enter the world of philosophical enquiry.\n2.6 Reconciliation of Conclusions\n\n\nAccording to Rosmini, eclecticism, especially that upheld by Victor\nCousin, is not the way to promote reconciliation between conclusions.\nPhilosophical systems are not brought together as a result of arbitrary\nchoice between what they offer. Each system, if it is truly such, will\nhave a principle from which deductions are made, and will be able to be\nreconciled, despite accidental differences, with every other system\nsharing the same principle. On the other hand, systems will not be\nreconcilable, despite their accidental agreement, if their basic\nprinciples differ. In the former case, agreement will be possible by\nworking back to the principle, and setting out once more from there; in\nthe second case, apparent agreement will only be skin-deep. Only shared\nprinciples allow for effective reconciliation between systems.\n3. The Objectivity of Thought and the Concept of Certainty\n\n\nRosmini sets out to establish the nature of thought and certainty in\nhis A New Essay concerning the Origin of Ideas. Faced by the\ncritical philosophy of Kant on the one hand, and by British empiricism\non the other, Rosmini reaches back to the pre-Socratics, to Plato and\nAristotle, to Augustine, Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure, in an\nendeavour to establish the nature of thought and the basis of certainty\nin human existence. As his guiding principles he takes the following\nrules:\nIn explaining facts connected with the human spirit, we\nmust not make fewer assumptions than are required to explain them...\n[nor must we] make more assumptions than are needed to explain the\nfacts (NE, vol. 1, 26\u20137).\n\n\nWith this as his methodological foundation, he places Locke,\nCondillac, Reid and Dugald Stewart among those whose explanation of the\nfact of thought is deficient; Plato, Aristotle, Leibniz and Kant are\nlisted amongst those whose explanation is in many ways excessive. In\nother words, he distinguishes between sensationalists who, according to\nhim, cannot explain the origin of ideas, and idealists who posit in\ntheir explanation more ideas or forms than are necessary. For him,\nhowever, human thought must depend upon the innate idea of being,\nwithout which nothing is intelligible. We cannot think of what is not.\nAt the same time, nothing more is needed than the single idea of being,\nand its possible determinations, brought about through sensation, to\nexplain all intellectual principles and the ramifications of\nthought.\n3.1 Objectivity\n\n\nAfter observing the fact of thought, Rosmini concludes that its\nabsolute basis, without which nothing is thought and thought is\nnothing, must be the knowledge of being. Reflection can remove\neverything from thought, and still leave it embryonically sound\nprovided the mind is granted the idea of being as its governing light.\nThis idea, which possesses the divine attributes of universality,\ninfinity, necessity and possibility, is not God himself but merely the\npossibility of things. Moreover, it acts in the mind, but without\nbecoming a subjective part of the mind. As intellectual light, it\nilluminates, but from outside the mind. And it illuminates without\nrevealing its source, as natural light can be seen without our looking\nat the sun. It is, as Dante would say, \u2018the light connecting\nintellect and truth\u2019 (Purgatorio 6: 45) and, as such, is\nthe quasi-form of the intellect and the image of truth. Determinations\nof this idea, all of which possess in some way the characteristics of\nbeing, especially its objectivity, are provided through sensations\nexperienced in the animal part of human existence and illuminated,\nbeing-wise, through the innate idea in which they are seen. Of\nthemselves, sensations do not constitute knowledge but, when felt in\nthe human subject, provide the matter of knowledge which determines the\nidea of being, that is, the form of knowledge. Knowledge consists first\nin the intuition of being, the universal, and then in a subsequent\nseries of judgments, or direct perceptions, through which knowing\nsubjects affirm the actual existence of what they have experienced\nsensationally. These direct perceptions cannot err, although reflection\nupon them, and a subsequent series of judgments, may be the source of\nerror. In a word, Rosmini holds that basic knowledge, consisting of the\nidea of being and its immediate determinations, provides all that is\nneeded for objective thought. Against idealists, he reduces the formal\nrequirements of thought to the intuition of being; against\nsensationalists, he maintains the per se inadequacy of the\nsenses to provide more than the matter of thought.\n3.2 Certainty\n\n\nObjectivity, therefore, is essentially a characteristic of what is\nknown. Certainty, in Rosmini\u2019s view, is a characteristic of the person\nwho knows, and can be defined as \u2018a firm and reasonable persuasion\nthat conforms to the truth\u2019 (NE, vol. 3, 1044). In other\nwords, we can be certain only of knowledge, not of error, and this\nbecause, according to Rosmini, to know and to know the truth is the\nsame thing. The person who does not know the truth, does not know.\nThere is no doubt, of course, that it is possible to be persuaded, and\nfirmly persuaded, of error. But rational persuasion of error arrived at\nthrough one\u2019s own reasoning is not possible. In this case, either the\npremiss is wrong, or the argument is erroneous. On the other hand, the\npersuasion must be firm. Certainty is not achieved without energy\ndirected into persuasion. Certainty requires that we know something to\nbe true, to be what it is, that we are persuaded that it is what we\nknow it to be, and that we have an adequate reason for our persuasion.\nAnd precisely because error attempts to alter the being of things,\nformal error will not be found rooted in the intellect nor in the\nsenses nor in involuntary reflection. It begins with the will, the only\nhuman faculty capable of drawing the reason to invent what it does not\nsee, or to deny what it sees. Under pressure from the will, reason will\nfalsely affirm that being is not, or deny that being is.\n4. The Dignity of the Human Person\n\n\nIt is already clear from what has been said that Rosmini, in his\nsolution to the basic problem of knowledge, has offered a perspective\nwhich places human dignity on a transcendent level. Human beings are\nmade such, he would maintain, by the intuition of being which\naccompanies them from the first moment of their existence. Through this\nintuition, they share in the finality of being itself and in some\nfinite way participate in its infinite characteristics. Nevertheless,\nthe subjective element proper to the human being neither can nor should\nbe denied. Indeed, it has to be examined thoroughly if a rational\naccount is to be rendered of the essential unitary make-up of human\nnature. This examination was carried out initially in Rosmini\u2019s A\nNew Essay concerning the Origin of Ideas as part of his\nexplanation of what he called \u2018impure\u2019 ideas, that is, ideas\nwhich, as perceptive (not simply intellective), require for their\norigin some sense experience. He pursued the investigation in his\nAnthropology as an Aid to Moral Science and in\nPsychology where in four volumes entitled The Essence of\nthe Human Soul, The Development of the Human Soul,\nLaws of Animality and Opinions about the Human Soul,\nhe observed and discussed at length the animal, as well as the\nintellectual side of human nature.\n\n\nThe first fact presented by observation on ourselves is the\nessential distinction in human beings between that which feels and that\nwhich is felt. According to Rosmini, these are quite different and\nunconfusible elements with opposite characteristics. That which feels\nis an immaterial principle (soul); that which is felt is the term\n(body) of this principle. Together feeler and felt constitute feeling,\nthe underlying subject of reflection when attention is concentrated on\n\u2018myself\u2019 and those elements which constitute\n\u2018myself\u2019. The chief action of body is to produce an\nundetermined, shapeless extension which enables that which feels to\nexperience determined sensations of various kinds. This\n\u2018fundamental feeling\u2019, with its permanent perception of\nunlimited space, is that in which all other feelings are perceived, and\nruns parallel, as it were, with the idea of being in which all other\nideas are intuited. Reaction to perceived feelings constitutes vital\ninstinct (relative to the fundamental feeling) and sensuous instinct\n(relative to the adventitious sensations). All feeling and instinct is\nper se unknown in Rosmini\u2019s view, and comes to be known\nthrough the formation in the knowing subject of ideas and perceptions\nwhich depend upon the illumination provided by the idea of being. Thus,\nfor Rosmini, the human being is a knowing and feeling subject, having\nwithin itself a principle which, formed by the light of being, knows\nand reacts to what it knows through the faculties of intellect and\nwill, and feels and reacts to what it feels through the faculties of\nsense and instinct. Within the human subject, the will - which reacts\nto what is known\u2014is the supreme active principle and as such\nconstitutes \u2018person\u2019 in the individual. The dignity of the\nhuman being lies within the will as such, in the first place, and then\nwithin the will\u2019s choice to second whatever the intellect knows. This\nis also the foundation of genuine freedom within the human subject.\nFree to adhere to or reject what is known, human beings cannot be\ncoerced by attempted external pressure or used as a means by others\nwithout prejudice to the inviolable truth in which they share innately\nthrough their participation in the light of being and which they attain\nadventitiously through the direct perception that unfolds determined\ntruths to their intellectual gaze.\n5. Morality\n\n\nRosmini\u2019s ethical philosophy springs directly from the analysis\nsummarised in the previous section. For him, \u2018the human being is a\nknowing and feeling subject whose will, as supreme principle of\nactivity, provides the basis of the incommunicable individuality that\nconstitutes each real human nature as a person\u2019 (Life, p.\n26). \u2018Person\u2019, as supreme principle, is also the subject of\nmoral activity, and is to be distinguished from all those habits and\nacts within human beings which take place without the necessary\nintervention of the person or, at most, effect the person indirectly.\nFor example, a good pianist is not necessarily a good person. Morality\ndeals necessarily with what people do as persons, with what affects\nthemselves as subjects who cannot step aside from the truth they know\nwithout violating their adherence to truth. Rosmini deals with ethics,\nthe science of morality, in his Principles of Ethics and in\nComparative and Critical History of Systems dealing with the\nPrinciple of Morality. The History first offers an\noverview of systems which throughout history deny morality, or make it\nimpossible, or provide it with a subjective foundation. It then moves\non to summarise the objective view expressed by philosophers and\ndeveloped by Rosmini in Principles of Ethics .\n5.1 Moral Obligation\n\n\nThis view, as stated by Rosmini, depends upon what he sees as a\nself-evident principle that cannot be denied by any sane person. We are\nbound, he says, to acknowledge (recognise) what we know for what we\nknow it to be. Granted that knowledge, according to Rosmini, is\nco-terminus with truth, never with error, it is clear that Rosmini\u2019s\naffirmation depends upon the self-evident need to affirm what one\nknows. This, in turn, is an act by which the human subject is elevated,\nat a reflective level, to the level of the truth which, already known\nin the essential idea of being, is as sublime as being itself. On the\nother hand, to deny what one knows is equivalent to stepping into\nnon-being, the antithesis of dignity. In more philosophical terms,\nRosmini maintains that the principle he enunciates, in which every\nother moral dictate is implicitly included, may be characterised as\nfollows: it expresses moral essence because it calls for agreement\nbetween the intellective act of the will and the ideal and real\nentities of things known; it is simple and as such able to be\nparticipated by every moral activity; it is evident because it is\nnothing more than an expression of the principle of contradiction; it\nis universal because all moral effects, denoted through external\nactions, depend upon it; it is supreme because it offers no possibility\nof further investigation; it provides the foundation for the\nrecognition of the human subject as an essentially moral being, that\nis, one who, through the innate presence of the idea of being and the\nprinciple of will, is furnished with the object of morality and\nessential adherence to it. Finally, Rosmini\u2019s distinction between the\nsubject and object of morality opens a way, according to him, between\nthe extremes of ethical theory. On the one hand, the limitation of the\nhuman subject provides for the possibility of moral error; on the\nother, the necessity and immutability of the object, the idea of being,\nfurnish morality with its undeniable sense of obligation. It is a fatal\nbut all too frequent mistake, Rosmini contends, to attribute\ncharacteristics proper to the subject (fallibility, error, and so on)\nto the object, and characteristics of the object (necessity,\nimmutability and so on) to the subject.\n5.2 Moral Good\n\n\nA way is now present to describe adequately the nature of moral good\nas opposed to eudemonological good. That which is good is desirable,\nbut what is desirable may either be desirable in itself, that is, as it\nstands in the order of being, or simply desirable in so far it is good,\nor imagined as good, for the individual. Moral good, says Rosmini, is\nfound when the will adheres to what is good according to the order of\nbeing; eudemonological or utilitarian good is what is desired as good\nfor the individual, without reference to what is good in itself. Human\ndignity is preserved only when, through an act of will, individuals\nadhering in practice to beings as they are in their order, implicitly\nadhere to the whole of being and to their presence in that order.\nImmorality, by which entities are appreciated or desired but not in\ntheir known order and thus not as they are, implies an essential\nrebellion against the order of being and thus against being itself.\nSelf-imposed human indignity can go no lower than this.\n5.3 Conscience\n\n\nHaving dealt with the nature of morality and moral obligation,\nRosmini turns his attention to conscience. He himself admits that such\na treatise is almost universally neglected by philosophers, and feels\nhimself constrained to justify such a study, which he undertakes with\nan almost inevitable admixture of religious and theological elements.\nNevertheless, it is not difficult to filter the philosophical\nprinciples in his work from characteristics proper to the faith he\nprofesses. This is especially apparent in his approach to the nature of\nconscience, an area in which his views first prompted the dissension\u2019s\nbetween him and some of his co-religionists that would go on until the\nend of his life. Rosmini defines conscience as a \u2018speculative\njudgement that a person makes about the morality of his practical\njudgement\u2019 (C19), that is, a judgement by which\nindividuals come to know the moral value of their actions without\nnecessarily acting upon it.\n\n\nSeveral consequences can be drawn from this. First, morality in the\nindividual is prior to conscience, and can be present without\nconscience; second, conscience can be mistaken (it is possible to form\na incorrect notion of the moral value of one\u2019s own action); third, it\ndoes not follow that conscience, once formed, will give rise to action\nin the person who forms it; fourth, conscience, if incorrect in its\njudgement, must as far as possible be reformed. Conscience, therefore,\nis only an adequate guide to morality when it provides accurate\ninformation of the moral state of a subject\u2019s past, present or future\naction. In the light of these affirmations, it is possible to see how\nRosmini lays the groundwork for overcoming the dilemma posed by the\nquestion: must conscience always be followed? While it is certain that\nthe dictates of conscience can never be morally disregarded, it is\nequally certain that a deliberately misleading act of conscience cannot\nmorally be followed. Sometimes, therefore, it will be morally\nimperative to correct conscience, which is always possible through\nproper reflection on the moral value of the human act posited or about\nto be posited by the individual. Rosmini goes on to distinguish between\nproblems about conscience and problems connected with the formation of\nconscience. In fact, conscience, according to him, is not present as\nlong as judgement is suspended about the moral value of an individual\u2019s\nown action. Difficulties at this point are connected with the formation\nof the judgement, not with the judgement itself.\n6. Human Rights\n\n\nRosmini\u2019s view of \u2018person\u2019, seen as an inviolable end\nwhich can never be reduced to the status of \u2018means\u2019, leads\nspontaneously to what today is seen as paramount in human existence,\nthat is, the question of human rights. These rights are studied at\nlength in The Philosophy of Right, a six-volume treatise in\nthe only extant English translation. The general title of the work\nshows immediately that for Rosmini all rights are founded in a single\nelement called \u2018right\u2019 from which all \u2018rights\u2019\nemanate, some innate in human beings, others springing from the\ndetermined circumstances of individuals or societies. The treatise can\nbe summed up under three heads: the essence of right, individual\nrights, social rights.\n6.1 The Essence of Right\n\n\nThe basis of Rosmini\u2019s teaching on human rights is a consequence of\nhis moral theory, of which he gives a careful synthesis in a preface to\nThe Philosophy of Right. If each person is morally obliged to\nrecognise in practice what is known for what it is known to be, every\nother human being will be recognised as essentially on a par with the\nknowing person, and will have to be acknowledged as such. But because\neach person is obliged to act in accordance with moral propriety, every\nperson is obliged to respect this obligation in the other on pain of\nviolating the moral law itself. Granted this principle as foundation,\nand \u2018right\u2019 as a relationship between one person and others\nby which a person has a claim to what is his own, Rosmini maintains\nthat \u2018person\u2019 is subsistent right. In other words, all rights\nare founded on that to which persons have a claim in so far as they are\nacting morally or are at least not acting immorally. Such activity\ncannot be the object of attack on the part of others without violation\nof persons as ends. \u2018Right\u2019, as he says, \u2018is a moral\ngovernance or authority to act, or: right is a faculty to do what we\nplease, protected by the moral law which obliges others to respect that\nfaculty\u2019 (ER, vol. 1, 237).\n\n\nThe essence of right is, therefore, the activity of a person or\npersons relative to other persons. This activity, however, can be\nexercised either by individuals or by persons acting as members of a\nsociety.\n6.2 Rights of individuals\n\n\nWhen a person\u2019s activity is actuated in a moral way, the object of\nthat activity becomes the person\u2019s own, that is, becomes proper to the\nperson in such a way that it cannot be violated without damage to the\nperson in whose ownership it is. Practical experience of this is found\nin what Rosmini calls \u2018jural resentment\u2019, the injured feeling\nthat occurs on the occasion of violation of some right and gives rise\nto an instinct for repossession or restitution. Such an experience is\nobviously not a fact related solely to matter; it is fundamentally a\nfact of the spirit where alone it can be felt. It is also an indication\nof the sphere of jural freedom within which a person is and must be\nleft free. More importantly, \u2018person\u2019 does not possess right,\nbut\u2014because formed by the light of being\u2014is right itself; does\nnot possess freedom, but is freedom. The divisions of activity give\nrise to two major kinds of rights in people. If what is possessed is\nsuch from the very beginning of existence in a human being (life, for\nexample), the individual possesses innate right(s) which may be called\n\u2018natural\u2019 (pertaining essentially to human nature) or\n\u2018rational\u2019 (the rights are what they are and cannot be\notherwise). But rights may also be acquired by human beings during the\ncourse of life through adventitious activity. When rights have been\nestablished in this way, they too are inviolable although there are\ncircumstances, such as lack of use, which dissolve the relationship of\nownership and thus leave the field open to others who may wish to\nextend their activity to the matter in question. Leaving these\ncircumstances aside, however, individual rights cannot be absorbed by\nothers. The State, for example, cannot absorb the inalienable rights\nproper to persons, nor can it be considered as more than its individual\nmembers in such a way that persons can be sacrificed for the sake of\nsociety.\n6.3 Social right\n\n\nNevertheless, societies exist within which rights arise from the\nbonds between intellectual beings. According to Rosmini, these\nsocieties fall under three headings: theocratic society, that is,\nsociety between God and his creatures; domestic society, which is\ndivided into conjugal and parental society; and civil society, that is,\nthe communion desired by several families who wish to entrust the\npreservation and the regulation of their rights to a single or\ncollective mind called \u2018government\u2019. Rosmini considers at\nsome length the rights arising in these societies. In particular, he\nponders the title of rights possessed by the Creator over human beings,\nthe rights proper to husband and wife, and to parents. Of special\ninterest is his description of the State as a society which, while it\nhas the duty to influence for the common good only the modality and\nexercise of rights in its citizens, has no power to create or destroy\nhuman rights. In fact, the general purpose of the State is to arrange\nthe exercise of individual rights in such a way that individuals are\nbetter able to enjoy the use of their innate and acquired rights. Thus,\nalthough in time of war the exercise of certain rights may be curtailed\nor even suspended, the rights remain invested in individuals to whose\nexercise they must be restored in normal circumstances. It is clear\nthat Rosmini\u2019s view of civil society is completely anti-totalitarian.\nHe does not, however, espouse the cause of modern democracy According\nto him, the principle of democracy is not \u2018one person, one\nvote\u2019, but would depend rather upon the contribution made by\ncitizens to the well-being of the State. Difficult to arrange in\npractice, the principle is nevertheless important, and can be\nconsidered the obverse of \u2018No taxation without\nrepresentation\u2019.\n7. The Nature and Purpose of Society\n\n\nIt is clear that Rosmini\u2019s view of rights in human society depends\nto a great extent on his views about the nature of society as such. In\nfact, his earliest work as a philosopher (1818\u20131826) was almost totally\ntaken up with a study of society, and was only abandoned when he saw\nthat his ideas would lack a solid foundation unless the problem of\nknowledge had first been confronted. Eventually (1837), he published\nhis ideas on society in The Philosophy of Politics in which he\ndeals with the principle according to which societies stand or fall,\nand the end to which societies are directed. . However, despite the\nuniversality of the principles examined in this work, their application\nis restricted to civil society. According to Rosmini, the first rule\nand criterion for governing any society whatsoever is this: That which\nconstitutes the existence or substance of a society is to be preserved\nand strengthened even at the cost of neglect to accidental refinement.\nThis is also the first rule of politics. It follows that the greatest\nerrors of government are those by which the government of a society,\nbecause of its excessive concern for the society\u2019s accidental progress,\nloses sight of that which constitutes the substance of the society. The\nsteps taken towards decline, that is, towards the substitution of\nessential matters by accidental, can be considered on four levels: the\nperiods of founders of societies and basic legislation; of genuine\ndevelopment; of external splendour; of frivolity. Beginning from the\nfirst stage, when attention is inevitably fixed on the nature itself of\na society, there is a gradual diminution of interest in underlying\nsocietal values until weakness, manifested in attention to frivolities\nand inability to concentrate on weightier matters, undermines the\nsociety\u2019s inner cohesion and its ability to withstand external inimical\npressures. This would explain the profound truth lying behind\nMachiavelli\u2019s observation: \u2018If a sect or republic is to survive\nfor any length of time, it must return frequently to its\nbeginning\u2019 (quoted in PP, vol. 1, 41)\n\n\nFor Rosmini, every society is simply the union of two or more people\nundertaken with the intention of obtaining a common advantage.\n\u2018All the persons in this union [forming a society] together have\nthe role of end, and the advantage expected from the association is\napplied equally to all (PP, vol. 2, 39). In other words, there\nmust be in every society a moral element, an element of justice, which\naffects the behaviour of the members towards one another, even if\ncollectively (as in Plato\u2019s case of a band of robbers) they are unjust\ntowards non-members. Hence the excellence of what Rosmini calls\n\u2018the social bond\u2019; where it is present and actuated, there is\nno injustice; injustice begins in its absence. In other words, the\nnature of society requires that those who form it, enjoy within it the\npersonal dignity of end. There is, therefore, a moral element inherent\nin every society. Using some persons, some members, as means, even for\nthe apparent good of the whole, is repugnant to the very nature of\nsociety. In a coherent universal society, such as that described by\nCicero\u2014\u2018This entire world is to be considered simply as a city\ncommon to both gods and human beings\u2019 (quoted in PP, vol.\n2, 49)\u2014there will inevitably be a tendency to maximum justice. This\nmeans, however, that no one in any society can make one person\nsubservient to another. All that is pertinent only to nature can be\nused as means; all that which is proper to person, or to which persons\nhave extended themselves so that some thing or things have become\nproper to them, must be respected as end. Here again, though, a\ndistinction must be made between that is proper to a member of a\nsociety as a person, and the modality of that which is proper. In\ncertain cases, the government of a society may change the modality of\nwhat is proper if this is for the common good. A piece of land required\nfor a road may, for instance, be substituted with an adequate sum of\nmoney. But those things which have no modality, such as innocent life,\ncannot be violated under the pretext of common good. It is clear that\nthese principles must direct the government of every society.\n\n\nRosmini also deals with the nature of the good which is the aim or\nend of society. For him, this good is human good which \u2018resides in\nvirtue and the eudemonological appurtenances of virtue, and in general\nin every good in so far as it is connected with virtue.\u2019 He\nconcludes, therefore, that every society, in so far as it is contrary\nto virtue, is illegitimate because its aim is contrary to the essence\nof society. At the same time, every law of society is invalid if, or in\nso far as, it prevents members from achieving virtue. \u2018Without\nvirtue there is no human good, the end for which society is\nestablished\u2019 (PP, vol. 2, 189). But while anti-virtue is\nessentially detrimental to the good of any society, virtue of itself is\nnot the only element forming the good in question. Contentment of\nspirit, that is, of the whole person, as distinct from passing pleasure\nconfined to parts of human nature, is also included in every society\u2019s\nessential aim. Anything, therefore, opposed to contentment is\ninevitably detrimental to society, whatever favour it may have found in\npublic opinion. Rosmini finds support for this affirmation in Hamilton,\nwhom he quotes approvingly (PP, vol. 2, 195).\nWhen occasions present themselves in which the interests of\nthe people are at variance with their inclinations, it is the duty of\nthe persons whom they have appointed to be the guardians of those\ninterests to withstand the temporary delusion in order to give them\ntime and opportunity for more cool and sedate reflection.\n\n\nPublic opinion, it would seem, is not an infallible criterion of\npublic good.\n8. Natural theology\n\n\nRosmini\u2019s natural theology, in the conventional philosophical sense\nof natural theology, can be summarised under two headings: proofs for\nthe existence of God, found scattered throughout his philosophical\nwritings, and theodicy, developed at length in a work of that name. But\nit will also be considered, under the heading \u2018Being\u2019\naccording to the meaning given it by Rosmini.\n8.1 The existence of God\n\n\nIn his natural theology, Rosmini offers considerations which are\nconsistent with the basic principles of his philosophical teaching.\nAlthough he does not deny the validity of a posteriori proofs\nof the existence of God, he affirms that an a priori method is\nmore satisfactory because it sets off from the idea of being, the\nfoundation of his philosophy, and argues to the necessity of God\u2019s\nexistence. First, however, he posits a fundamental barrier to the\nperception of God at a purely natural level of human nature. For\nRosmini, what is real can only be perceived through feeling, which\nindeed is part of human existence but only at a finite level where it\ncannot be the vehicle of the perception of God\u2019s infinite reality.\nIdeal being, however, while expressing only the possibility, not the\nreality of things, is shown on analysis to be characterised by\nnecessity, eternity and immateriality, factors which are intrinsic\nmarks of possibility. The idea of being, therefore, with its divine\ncharacteristics serves as a bridge between God and human beings,\nenabling us to posit proofs of God\u2019s existence without our knowing him\nthrough perception, or real contact. One example of the a\npriori proofs may be given here. If infinite, intelligible being\nis present to the human mind\u2014and Rosmini would maintain that it is\u2014an infinite mind capable of giving this idea to humans must exist.\nBut such a mind cannot not be God. In this and all similar proofs,\nthere is a common mode of procedure. The existence of God is necessary\nfor the existence of intelligible being; but intelligible being\ncertainly exists; the existence of God is therefore necessary. Having\ndetermined the existence of God, Rosmini then makes use of divinely\nrevealed truth as a basis on which to offer some reflections about the\nnature of what he has proved to exist. These reflections, he would\nmaintain, lie within the scope of philosophy because they depend\nmethodologically solely on reason, and conclude with rational, not\nauthoritative affirmations. Their basis in revelation, however,\nprecludes any examination of them here.\n8.2 Theodicy\n\n\nRosmini provides an exact description of his aim in his work on\ntheodicy. \u2018Theodicy (theou dike) means \u201cjustice of God\u201d. The\nintent of this work, therefore, is simply this: to justify God\u2019s equity\nand goodness in the distribution of good and evil in the world.\u2019\n(Theodicy preface).\n\n\nHe also provides a clear indication of the method he will follow in\nthe three books composing his Theodicy. The first prescribes\nthe norms to be followed in judging about the disposition of divine\nprovidence if error is to be avoided; the second considers the laws of\nnature, the necessary limitations of what is created and the chain of\ncauses operating in the universe; the third is devoted to the laws\naccording to which God\u2019s action takes place in the world he has\ncreated. These laws all spring from a single norm, the law of the least\nmeans, which Rosmini, following Aquinas, posits as follows: \u2018The\nwise worker carries out his work in the briefest way possible\u2019\n(Sapiens operator perficit opus suum breviori via qua potest.\nST, III, q. 4, art. 5, ad 3um). From this law, another ten are\ndeduced whose titles provide a useful indication of their possible\napplication. They are the laws of: excluded superfluity, the permission\nof evil, excluded equality, unity in the divine work, heroism,\nantagonism, rapidity in work, accumulation of good, and germ. These\nlaws, according to Rosmini, are concerned with God\u2019s providence\nrelative to universal good. At the same time, but relative to\nparticular good, the law followed is that of: supreme justice, equity,\nfittingness and conformity to God\u2019s divine attributes. Divine\ngovernance consists in acting in such a way that the aspects of\nuniversal and particular good are harmonised.\n9. Being\n\n\nThe last nine years of Rosmini\u2019s life, with the exception of 1848\u20139\nwhen he was actively engaged in political affairs, were spent in great\npart working on his Theosophy (Teosofia). Despite its\nsize (five volumes), this monumental work remained unfinished at\nRosmini\u2019s death and was published posthumously. The title itself,\ndespite its obvious etymological implications, is today unhelpful. It\nwould seem to indicate a philosophy \u2018professing to achieve a\nknowledge of God by spiritual ecstasy, direct intuition or special\nindividual relations\u2019 (COD). Rosmini, however, is\nconcerned here only with reasoning about God, and takes the word\n\u2018theosophy\u2019 in its fundamental meaning of \u2018wisdom about\nGod\u2019 in so far as God is the supreme Being and the apex of\nphilosophical speculation. Such speculation must sooner or later deal\nwith the problem of the One Being and many beings, with unity and\nplurality in all their manifestations. In many ways, the book is a\ndirect challenge to Hegel and Schelling with whose philosophy Rosmini\nhad become thoroughly familiar as a result of the great editions of\ntheir works published in the 1830s and early 1840s. Kant\u2019s teaching,\nalready challenged in Rosmini\u2019s A New Essay concerning the Origin\nof Ideas, was now to be opposed in what Rosmini perceived as the\ndelirium and exaggerations of Kant\u2019s Idealist successors.\nWhenever we try to reduce the whole human being to\nspeculation, and substitute the part for the whole, we presume that all\nhuman good must lie solely in speculation. As result, we make every\neffort to turn what is real into an idea; we try to derive from the\nidea the matter which constitutes the sensible world, together with the\nSpirit and finally God himself\u2026 But although Schelling and Hegel\nclaimed that they had reached such total science, they still needed to\nteach it publicly not only for the sake of attaining the practice of\nvirtue (which would make it worthwhile), but even to draw a salary.\nThis proves without doubt that their absolute idea did not contain\neverything. If the world were present in it, as they said it was,\nwheat, bread and wine would have been there also. My theosophy\ncertainly cannot give the public such magnificent and wonderful\npromises, but it will explain how the speculative human mind is\ninclined to find everything in itself. In other words, it will\ndemonstrate that there must be an object which contains effectively\nwithin itself the universality of things, and that this object is not\nthe idea in our mind. Nevertheless, the idea which shines in the human\nmind draws its form as object from that object. Hence, because the idea\nalso is per se object, we easily confuse it, in our\nspeculation, with the complete, subsistent object. A strong desire then\narises in us of attributing to the idea which we intuit the attributes\nof the subsistent object which we know must exist, although we do not\nintuit it. The tendency to unity, an essential element of every\nintellect, causes this error and forces us towards an abyss of unseen\nabsurdities in the hope that these will satisfy our desperate purpose.\nWe should acknowledge (and this theosophy will demonstrate) that if\nbeing itself has an objective existence, it is per se\nintelligible, and that if it contains everything (that which is not\nbeing is nothing), everything must also be contained in that which is\nintelligible. Theosophy will also clearly show that, although being\nmust actually have this primal form, human nature cannot intuit the\nintelligible which contains all. Human nature arrives at this\nsolely by reasoning, which can provide only a formal, negative concept\nof it. We cannot therefore have either the absolute knowledge which\nSchelling attributes to us through direct intuition, or the absolute\nidea which his disciple, George Hegel (who was opposed to all\nimmediacy), promised us by mediate reasoning\u2026 (TH, vol.\n1, Preface, 9\u201310)\n\n\nBut the main thrust of the work is positive, rather than\ncritical.\nTheosophy will not be wasting time by demonstrating that\nbehind this well-conceived and ingenious error [of Hegel] lies a great\ntruth which those courageous speculative minds [Schelling and Hegel]\ntried in vain to grasp but could not. This truth is precisely the\nnecessity I spoke of: there must be \u2018something intelligible and\neternal which contains everything\u2019... Nevertheless, although\nabsolute knowledge is proper to God but not to us, we do have an\nabsolute knowledge relative to form, but not to matter (cf.\nNE, vol. 1, 325, 474\u2013476). This kind of absoluteness of human\nknowledge caused errors in the German school, which I have already\ndiscussed. Theosophy must speak at length about absolute human\nknowledge, indeed it must use it and more importantly be it. Theosophy\nis simply the Theory of Ens (this definition is not to be despised,\ndespite its being only two words). Because ens is first of all infinite\nand absolute, and only later enclosed and existing within limits as\nfinite, no thought could attain it unless thought itself somehow became\nabsolute. A thought informed by an object which is in some way\nabsolute, is itself in some way made absolute. Plato therefore rightly\ncalled the treatise on what is greatest, the treatise about ens. There\nis nothing in the universe or in our mind antecedent to ens or being.\nWhen, in the order of things, we remove being, nothing remains except\ndarkness in the order of cognition. For this reason the doctrine of\nens, which I call \u2018theosophy\u2019, corresponds to the concept of\nphilosophy in the ancients. According to them, philosophy differs from\nother sciences in that all other sciences suppose undemonstrated\nprinciples. Philosophy, however, which borrows nothing from anywhere,\nuses its own materials to construct itself. It starts from no\ngratuitous hypothesis or supposition\u2014on the contrary, it seeks and\nestablishes what is undemonstrable, which gives it an unshakeable\nbasis, and admits only what is necessary (Ibid.,\n10\u201312).\n\n\nFor Rosmini, the problem of being is finally considered under the\nthree divisions of the science of theosophy: ontology, rational\ntheology and cosmology, each of which must enter into the other if the\nscience is to be complete. In fact, he maintains, it is impossible to\nspeak of being in all its universal essence (ontology), without regard\nto the infinity and absoluteness of Being (rational theology), just as\nit is impossible to consider the world philosophically (cosmology)\nwithout taking its cause into consideration. Each of the three\ndivisions of theosophy is as essential to the whole as, according to\nhis example, the various vital organs are necessary to the existence of\nan animal. But the centre and substance of the whole treatise is\nteaching about God, without which there is no final explanation of the\nbeing or the world. Theosophy, therefore, is a single science which,\nthrough its division into three parts, is both one and three. Such an\naffirmation is paradigmatic of the thrust of Rosmini\u2019s theosophy which\neventually enables him to confront this rational science with the\ndoctrine of the Trinity.\n9.1 Ontology\n\n\nOntology, according to Rosmini\u2019s description of it, considers being\nin all its universality, but only as the object of human thought which\nputs limited, intellectual beings in contact with the possibility of\nall that is, not with actuality (it is impossible, for instance, to\nassuage hunger by thinking about a meal). Thought must, therefore,\nreach out to absolute reality not through direct perception of God, but\nby means of concepts. Ontology, dealing with these concepts\nanalytically and synthetically is, as it were, an immense preface to\nrational theology. Ontology as the theory of being in all its\npossibility is the necessary propedeutic to theology as the theory of\nabsolute being without which ontology itself is inevitably incomplete,\nand cannot progress beyond a treatise on categories and on\ndialectic.\n9.2 Rational theology\n\n\nIf, as Rosmini suggests, ontology is the \u2018theory of abstract\nbeing\u2019, rational theology is the \u2018theory of subsistent\nBeing\u2019. These two parts of theosophy cannot, however, can be\ndistinguished only if the same universal concepts, of which both are\nformed, can in some way be differentiated. This is done by considering\nthat ontology serves to find, review, and describe the nature and\nrelationship of these concepts; theology, in Rosmini\u2019s understanding,\nsynthesises them to form a single concept of the infinite Being. It is\ntrue that such a concept remains abstract (the essence contained in the\nconcept is not beheld by the knowing subject), but the\n\u2018theologian\u2019 passes from the concept to affirm subsistent\nBeing, which is therefore no longer a mere concept, but something which\nmust exist in itself. An effort is then made in rational theology to\nsee how the ontological concepts have their truth and their foundation\nin first subsistent Being. While this takes place, the concepts\nthemselves are identified and become one. Their separation, now\nconsidered anew, is seen to be relative not to first subsistent Being,\nbut to the beholding, finite mind. The problem of the One and the many\nis rooted not in the nature of absolute, subsistent Being, but in being\nby participation.\n9.3 Cosmology\n\n\nOntology, while a preface to rational theology, is also necessary\nfor knowledge of the intimate nature of finite being and the world.\nRosmini posits three reasons for this. First, although finite being is\nperceived, perception is limited to very few beings. If the essential\nconditions of this being are to be known, it is necessary to know the\ncommon conditions of all finite beings. This cannot be done without\nrecourse to universal principles which enable us to deduce what is\nlacking to limited experience. Second, the same principles are needed\nto provide a notion of finite beings in themselves, divested of the\nsensory phenomena that accompany their perception. Third, subsistent\nBeing, if known, would be intelligible per se. This is not the\ncase with finite beings, which are known through their participation in\nintellectual light, and consequently remain unknown without some\nrelationship to concepts.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["References", "Critical Edition", "Other Editions", "Translations", "Secondary Works"], "cat_ref_text": {"References": "</h3>\n<p>\n\n", "Critical Edition": " in this article to Rosmini\u2019s works use the following\nabbreviations:</p>\n<dl class=\"sentag\">\n<dt><em>NE</em></dt><dd><em>A New Essay concerning the Origin of Ideas</em></dd>\n<dt><em>IP</em></dt><dd><em>Introduction to Philosophy</em></dd>\n<dt><em>PR</em></dt><dd><em>The Philosophy of Right</em></dd>\n<dt><em>PP</em></dt><dd><em>The Philosophy of Politics</em></dd>\n<dt><em>TH</em></dt><dd><em>Theosophy</em></dd></dl>\n<p>\n\nOther abbreviations:</p>\n<dl class=\"sentag tag3em\">\n<dt><em>Life</em></dt>\n<dd>\n<em>Antonio Rosmini: Introduction to his Life and Teaching</em>\n</dd>\n<dt><em>CFD</em></dt>\n<dd><em>Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith</em><dd>\n<dt><em>COD</em></dt>\n<dd><em>Concise Oxford Dictionary</em></dd>\n</dd></dd></dl>\n<h3>", "Other Editions": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "<em>Opere edite e inedite di Antonio Rosmini</em>.
