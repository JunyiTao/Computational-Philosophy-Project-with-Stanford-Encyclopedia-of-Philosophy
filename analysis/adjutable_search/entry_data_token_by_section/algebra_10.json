    "main_text": "Universal Algebra\n3. Universal Algebra\n\nUniversal algebra is the next level of abstraction after abstract\nalgebra. Whereas elementary algebra treats equational reasoning in a\nparticular algebra such as the field of reals or the field of complex\nnumbers, and abstract algebra studies particular classes of algebras\nsuch as groups, rings, or fields, universal algebra studies classes of\nclasses of algebras. Much as abstract algebra numbers groups, rings,\nand fields among its basic classes, so does universal algebra count\nvarieties, quasivarieties, and elementary classes among its basic\nclasses of classes.\n\nA model of a theory is a structure for which all the\nequations of that theory are identities. Terms are built up from\nvariables and constants using the operations of the theory. An\nequation is a pair of terms; it is satisfied by an algebra when the\ntwo terms are equal under all valuations of (assignments of values to)\nthe \\(n\\) variables appearing in the terms, equivalently when they\ndenote the same \\(n\\)-ary operation. A quasiequation is a pair\nconsisting of a finite set of equations, called the premises or\nantecedents, and another equation, the conclusion; it is satisfied by\nan algebra when the two terms of the conclusion are equal under all\nvaluations of the \\(n\\) variables appearing in the terms satisfying\nthe premises. A first order formula is a quantified Boolean\ncombination of relational terms.\n\nA variety is the class of all models of a set of equations. A\nquasivariety is the class of all models of a set of\nquasiequations. An elementary class is the class of all\nmodels of a set of first-order formulas.\n\nQuasivarieties have received much less attention than either varieties\nor elementary classes, and we accordingly say little about them here.\nElementary classes are treated in sufficient depth elsewhere in this\nencyclopedia that we need not consider them here. We therefore focus\nin this section on varieties.\n\nAbelian groups, groups, rings, and vector spaces over a given field\nall form varieties.\n\nA central result in this area is the theorem that a lattice arises as\nthe lattice of subalgebras of some algebra if and only if it arises as\nthe lattice of congruences on some algebra. Lattices of this sort are\ncalled algebraic lattices. When the congruences of an algebra\npermute, its congruence lattice is modular, a strong condition\nfacilitating the analysis of finite algebras in particular.\n",
