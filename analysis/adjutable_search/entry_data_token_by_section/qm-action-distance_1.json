    "main_text": "Bell's theorem and non-locality\n2. Bell's theorem and non-locality\n\n\nIn a famous theorem, John Bell (1964) demonstrated that granted some\nplausible assumptions, any local model of the EPR/B experiment is\ncommitted to certain inequalities about the probabilities of\nmeasurement outcomes, \u2018the Bell inequalities,\u2019 which are\nincompatible with the quantum-mechanical predictions. When Bell proved\nhis theorem, the EPR/B experiment was only a thought experiment. But\ndue to technological advances, various versions of this experiment have\nbeen conducted since the 1970s, and their results have overwhelmingly\nsupported the quantum-mechanical predictions (for brief reviews of\nthese experiments and further references, see the entry on Bell's\ntheorem and Redhead 1987, chapter 4, section 4.3 and \u2018Notes and\nReferences\u2019). Thus, a wide consensus has it that the quantum\nrealm involves some type of non-locality.\n\n\nThe basic idea of Bell's theorem is as follows. A model of the EPR/B\nexperiment postulates that the state of the particle pair together\nwith the apparatus settings to measure (or not to measure) certain\nspin properties determine the probabilities for single and joint\nspin-measurement outcomes. A local Bell model of this experiment also\npostulates that probabilities of joint outcomes factorize into the\nsingle probabilities of the L- and the R- outcomes: The probability of\njoint outcomes is equal to the product of the probabilities of the\nsingle outcomes. More formally, let \u03bb denote the pair's state\nbefore any measurement occurs. Let l denote the setting of\nthe L-measurement apparatus to measure spin along the l-axis\n(i.e., the l-spin of the L-particle), and let r\ndenote the setting of the R-measurement apparatus to measure spin\nalong the r-axis (i.e., the r-spin of the\nR-particle). Let xl be the outcome of a\nl-spin measurement in the L-wing, and let\nyr be the outcome of a r-spin measurement\nin the R-wing; where xl is either the L-outcome\nl-spin \u2018up\u2019 or the L-outcome l-spin\n\u2018down,\u2019 and yr is either the R-outcome\nr-spin \u2018up\u2019 or the R-outcome r-spin\n\u2018down.\u2019 Let P\u03bb l\nr(xl & yr) be\nthe joint probability of the L- and the R-outcome, and\nP\u03bb\nl(xl) and\nP\u03bb\nr(yr) be the single\nprobabilities of the L- and the R-outcome, respectively; where the\nsubscripts \u03bb, l and r denote the factors that\nare relevant for the probabilities of the outcomes\nxl and yr. Then, for any\n\u03bb, l, r, xl and\n yr:[3]\n\nFactorizability\nP\u03bb\u2009l\u2009r(xl\n & yr) =\n P\u03bb\u2009l(xl)\n \u00b7\n P\u03bb\u2009r(yr).\n\n\n\n(Here and henceforth, for simplicity's sake we shall denote events and\nstates, such as the measurement outcomes, and the propositions that\nthey occur by the same symbols.)\n\n\nThe state \u03bb is typically thought of as the pair's state at the\nemission time, and it is assumed that this state does not change in\nany relevant sense between the emission and the first measurement. It\nis (generally) a different state from the quantum-mechanical pair's\nstate \u03c8. \u03c8 is assumed to be an incomplete state of the pair,\nwhereas \u03bb is supposed to be a (more) complete state of the\npair. Accordingly, pairs with the same state \u03c8 may have different\nstates \u03bb which give rise to different probabilities of outcomes\nfor the same type of measurements. Also, the states \u03bb may be\nunknown, hidden, inaccessible or uncontrollable.\n\n\nFactorizability is commonly motivated as a locality condition. In\nnon-local models of the EPR/B experiment, the correlations between the\ndistant outcomes are accounted for by non-local influences between the\ndistant measurement events. For example, in orthodox quantum mechanics\nthe first spin measurement on, say, the L-particle causes an immediate\nchange in the spin properties of the R-particle and in the\nprobabilities of future outcomes of spin measurements on this particle.\nBy contrast, in local models of this experiment the correlations are\nsupposed to be accounted for by a common cause\u2014the pair's\nstate \u03bb (see Fig. 2 below): The pair's state and the\nL-setting determine the probability of the L-outcome; the pair's\nstate and the R-setting determine the probability of the\nR-outcome; and the pair's state and the L- and the\nR-setting determine the probability of joint outcomes, which (as\nmentioned above) is simply the product of these single probabilities.\nThe idea is that the probability of each of the outcomes is determined\nby \u2018local events,\u2019 i.e., events that are confined to its\nbackward light-cone, and which can only exert subluminal or luminal\ninfluences on it (see Figure 3 below); and the distant outcomes are\nfundamentally independent of each other, and thus their joint\nprobability factorizes. (For more about this reasoning, see sections 6\nand 8-9.)\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A schematic common-cause model of the EPR/B\nexperiment.  Arrows denote causal connections.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A space-time diagram of a local model of\nthe EPR/B experiment. The circles represent the measurement events,\nand the cones represent their backward light cones, i.e., the\nboundaries of all the subluminal and luminal influences on them. The\ndotted lines denote the propagation of the influences of the pair's\nstate at the emission and of the settings of the measurement\napparatuses on the measurement outcomes.\n\n\n\nA Bell model of the EPR/B experiment also postulates that for each\nquantum-mechanical state \u03c8 there is a distribution \u03c1 over all\nthe possible pair states \u03bb, which is\nindependent of the settings of the apparatuses. That is, the\ndistribution of the (\u2018complete\u2019) states \u03bb depends on\nthe (\u2018incomplete\u2019) state \u03c8, and this distribution\nis independent of the particular choice of measurements in the L- and\nR-wing (including the choice not to measure any quantity). Or\nformally, for any quantum-mechanical state \u03c8, L-settings\nl and l\u2032, and R-settings r and\nr\u2032:\n\n\u03bb-independence \n \u03c1\u03c8\u2009l\u2009r(\u03bb) =\n \u03c1\u03c8\u2009l\u2032\u2009r(\u03bb) =\n \u03c1\u03c8\u2009l\u2009r\u2032(\u03bb) =\n \u03c1\u03c8\u2009l\u2032\u2009r\u2032(\u03bb) =\n \u03c1\u03c8(\u03bb)\n\n\n\nwhere the subscripts denote the factors that are potentially\nrelevant for the distribution of the states \u03bb.\n\n\nAlthough the model probabilities (i.e., the probabilities of outcomes\nprescribed by the states \u03bb) are different from the\ncorresponding quantum-mechanical probabilities of outcomes (i.e., the\nprobabilities prescribed by the quantum-mechanical states \u03c8),\nthe quantum mechanical probabilities (which have been systematically\nconfirmed) are recovered by averaging over the model probabilities.\nThat is, it is supposed that the quantum-mechanical probabilities\nP\u03c8 l\nr(xl & yr),\nP\u03c8 l(xl)\nand\nP\u03c8 r(yr)\nare obtained by averaging over the model probabilities\nP\u03bb l\nr(xl & yr),\nP\u03bb l\n(xl) and\nP\u03bb r(yr),\nrespectively: For any \u03c8, l, r, xl and yr,\n\nEmpirical Adequacy \nP\u03c8\u2009l\u2009r(xl\n & yr) = \n   \u222b\u03bb\u2009P\u03bb\u2009l\u2009r(xl \n & yr) \u00b7\n \u03c1\u03c8\u2009l\u2009r(\u03bb)\nP\u03c8\u2009l(xl) \n =\n \u222b\u03bb\u2009P\u03bb\u2009l(xl )\n \u00b7\n \u03c1\u03c8\u2009l(\u03bb)\nP\u03c8\u2009r(yr) \n =\n \u222b\u03bb\u2009P\u03bb\u2009r(yr)\n \u00b7\n \u03c1\u03c8\u2009r(\u03bb).[4]\n\n\n\nThe assumption of \u03bb-independence is very plausible. It\npostulates that (complete) pair states at the source are uncorrelated\nwith the settings of the measurement apparatuses. And independently of\none's philosophical view about free will, this assumption is strongly\nsuggested by our experience, according to which it seems possible to\nprepare the state of particle pairs at the source independently of the\nset up of the measurement apparatuses.\n\n\nThere are two ways to try to explain a failure of\n\u03bb-independence. One possible explanation is that\npairs' states and apparatus settings share a common cause, which\nalways correlates certain types of pairs' states \u03bb with\ncertain types of L- and R-setting. Such a causal hypothesis will be\ndifficult to reconcile with the common belief that apparatus settings\nare controllable at experimenters' will, and thus could be set\nindependently of the pair's state at the source. Furthermore,\nthinking of all the different ways one can measure spin properties and\nthe variety of ways in which apparatus settings can be chosen, the\npostulation of such common cause explanation for settings and\npairs' states would seem highly ad hoc and its existence\nconspiratorial.\n\n\nAnother possible explanation for the failure of \u03bb-independence\nis that the apparatus settings influence the pair's state at the\nsource, and accordingly the distribution of the possible pairs' states\n\u03bb is dependent upon the settings. Since the settings can be\nmade after the emission of the particle pair from the source, this\nkind of violation of \u03bb-independence would require backward\ncausation. (For advocates of this way out of non-locality, see Costa\nde Beauregard 1977, 1979, 1985, Sutherland 1983, 1998, 2006 and Price\n1984, 1994, 1996, chapters 3, 8 and 9.) On some readings of John\nCramer's (1980, 1986) transactional interpretation of quantum\nmechanics (see Maudlin 1994, pp. 197-199), such violation of\n\u03bb-independence is postulated. According to this interpretation,\nthe source sends \u2018offer\u2019 waves forward to the measurement\napparatuses, and the apparatuses send \u2018confirmation\u2019 waves\n(from the space-time regions of the measurement events) backward to\nthe source, thus affecting the states of emitted pairs according to\nthe settings of the apparatuses.  The question of whether such a\ntheory can reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics is a\ncontroversial matter (see Maudlin 1994, pp. 197-199, Berkovitz 2002,\nsection 5, and Kastner 2006). It is noteworthy, however, that while\nthe violation of \u03bb-independence is sufficient for circumventing\nBell's theorem, the failure of this condition per se does not\nsubstantiate locality. The challenge of providing a local model of the\nEPR/B experiment also applies to models that violate\n\u03bb-independence. (For more about these issues, see sections 9\nand 10.3.)\n\n\nIn any case, as Bell's theorem demonstrates, factorizability,\n\u03bb-independence and empirical adequacy jointly imply the Bell\ninequalities, which are violated by the predictions of orthodox quantum\nmechanics (Bell 1964, 1966, 1971, 1975a,b). Granted the systematic\nconfirmation of the predictions of orthodox quantum mechanics and the\nplausibility of \u03bb-independence, Bell inferred that\nfactorizability fails in the EPR/B experiment. Thus, interpreting\nfactorizability as a locality condition, he concluded that the quantum\nrealm is non-local.
