The purpose of this entry is to describe\nthese tools: where they come from, how they work, and what they can be\nused to do. The description is by necessity sketchy, but several more\ncomprehensive surveys exist in the literature and will be referred to\nwhen appropriate. To fully appreciate the text below, basic\nfamiliarity with elementary set theoretic terminology, and with the\nlanguage of first-order logic will be helpful.\n",
