    "main_text": "The Equality of the Sexes || Similarity of the sexes\n4.2 Similarity of the sexes\n\nIn addition to showing that claims about inequality are false, Poulain\naims to show that the sexes are equal, because they are in all\nrelevant respects similar. In the second part of De l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, this argument is placed under the subtitle\nWomen, when considered from the perspective of the principles of\nsound philosophy, are as capable as men of every kind of\nknowledge and begins with the above (in\n section 2.2)\n cited claim that \u201cthe mind has no sex\u201d (T1en 157; TTfr\n99). Poulain argues:\n\n\nIt is easy to see that sexual differences apply only to the body.\nSince, strictly speaking, the body alone is involved in the\nreproduction of human beings and the mind merely gives its assent and\ndoes so in the same manner in everyone, it follows that the mind has\nno sex. (T1en 157; TTfr 99\u2013100)\n\n\nHere, Poulain is primarily concerned with the nature of the mind, but\nthe way he connects reproduction and assent is also noteworthy and\ncorresponds to his emphasis, in De l\u2019exellence, that\nwhen a woman and a man \u201cagree to live together it is purely\nvoluntary\u201d (TTen 280; TTfr 313; see also De\nl\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, T1en 153; TTfr 95). From his claim\nabout equal consent, Poulain draws the conclusion that if \u201cthe\nmind is considered in itself, it is found to be equal and to have the\nsame nature in all human beings, and to be capable of every kind of\nthought\u201d (T1en 158; TTfr 100; see also\n section 2.2).\n\nThe equality of independent minds is not enough, though, since human\nbeings are compounds of minds and bodies. Minds are constantly\naffected by bodies. Therefore Poulain continues by arguing that the\nbodies of the sexes are also similar in all cognitively relevant respects. He claims that this is particularly true of the brain:\n\n\n[The fact that the mind functions no differently in one sex than in\nthe other] is even clearer if one considers only the head, which is\nthe unique organ of scientific knowledge and in which the mind\nexercises all its functions. Even with the most detailed anatomical\ninvestigations, we cannot observe any difference in this organ between\nmen and women. The brains of the latter are completely similar to\nours; they receive and combine sensory impressions there in the same\nway as we do, and they store them for the imagination and memory in\nexactly the same way. (T1en 158; TTfr 101)\n\n\nThe problem with an argument based on the similarity of cognitive\norgans such as the brain, is that it makes equality dependent on\nempirical findings. The \u201cmost detailed anatomical\ninvestigations\u201d to which Poulain refers was not very advanced\naccording to today\u2019s standards and the contemporary Cartesian\nMalebranche drew different conclusions about women\u2019s brains,\nincluding their imaginations (see also Clarke 2013: 44, 50).\nMalebranche does not claim that all women have weaker capacities than\nall men, quite the contrary: \u201csome women are found to have\nstronger minds than some men\u201d, but he argues that most women\n\u201ccannot use their imagination for working out complex and\ntangled questions\u201d and connects this inability to the\n\u201cdelicacy of the brain fibers [that] is the principal cause of\nall these effects\u201d (Malebranche 1674\u201375 [1997: 130]).\nPresent day brain research is more advanced, but has still not settled\nthe question of whether there are cognitively significant differences\nbetween women and men. Considered as a philosophical argument, an\nappeal to brain research remains weak. In order to avoid reducing the\nquestion of mental capacity to a question to be answered by brain\nscientists, we need a concept of the mind that cannot be reduced to\nthe physiological body.\n\nEven if Poulain emphasizes the similarity of the cognitively\nsignificant physical organs of women and men, he does not seem to want\nto provide a thoroughly materialist account (see also\n section 2.2).\n Jacqueline Broad has developed a nuanced interpretation of\nPoulain\u2019s position, where she emphasizes the role of the free\nwill and in particular its capacity to assent or dissent (Broad 2017:\n74\u201376). Descartes famously argued that a judgment consists of\ntwo elements: a perception of the intellect and an action of the will.\nIn order to avoid error, the will must assent only to those\nperceptions that are clear and distinct (e.g., Principia\n\u00a7\u00a7 32\u201335; CSM I, 204; AT VIIIA, 17\u201318).\nAccording to this account it is ultimately the will which is\nresponsible when we err. Broad\u2019s interpretation builds on the\npassage in De l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 where Poulain\nclaims that \u201cwe can yoke our will to [the causes of the\npassions] or dissociate it from them\u201d (TTen 84; TTfr 102; see\nalso\n section 2.2).\n She argues that \n\n\nlike Descartes, Poullain suggests that agents are capable of\novercoming the influence of their bodies through the exercise of free\nwill: they might either \u201cyoke\u201d their will to the causes of\ntheir passions or \u201cdissociate\u201d it from them. (Broad 2017:\n76; on Descartes\u2019 and Poulain\u2019s\naccounts of judgment, see also Reuter 2013: 79\u201380)\n\n\nBroad\u2019s interpretation captures Poulain\u2019s egalitarian\nintentions and an account built on the independence of the will has\nthe obvious advantage that even if there would be empirically\ndetectable differences in how women and men are influenced by their\nbodies, they may share an equal freedom of will to assent or dissent\nto their passions as well as imaginings (see also Reuter 2019:\n49\u201351). The philosophical problem with this account is that it\nleaves Poulain\u2019s position open to the objections raised most\nprominently by Elisabeth of Bohemia in her correspondence with\nDescartes. On 22 June 1645 she writes:\n\n\nI know well that in removing everything upsetting to me (which I\nbelieve to be represented only by the imagination) from the idea of an\naffair, I would judge it healthily and would find in it the remedies\nas well as the affection which I bring to it. But I have never known\nhow to put this into practice until the passion has already played its\nrole. (Shapiro [ed.] 2007: 93; AT IV, 233\u2013234)\n\n\nElisabeth is describing her inability to dissociate her will from the\naffairs that affect her. This lack of ability is not due to a lack of\nknowledge about how external influences act on her, quite the\ncontrary, she is well aware of the roles played by the passions and\nthe imagination, but argues that regardless of her knowledge, she is\nunable to voluntarily dissociate her assent. In this letter Elisabeth\nis arguing from her personal experience, but her criticism is framed\nby the metaphysical questions she raised in her early letters. In her\nsecond letter (10 June 1643) she summarizes the point:\n\n\nit is altogether very difficult to understand that a soul, as you have\ndescribed it, after having had the faculty and the custom of reasoning\nwell, can lose all of this by some vapors, and that, being able to\nsubsist without the body, and having nothing in common with it, the\nsoul is still so governed by it. (Shapiro [ed.] 2007: 68; AT III,\n685)\n\n\nElisabeth raises the question of how it is possible that the mind can\nbe simultaneously distinct from and affected by the body. These are\nexactly the kind of metaphysical worries that Poulain leaves\nunaddressed, with the consequence that he is unable to provide a valid\nmetaphysical basis for his claims about the similarity of the\nsexes.\n",
