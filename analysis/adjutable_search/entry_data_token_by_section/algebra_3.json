    "main_text": "Elementary Algebra || Cartesian geometry\n1.4 Cartesian geometry\n\nLines, circles, and other curves in the plane can be expressed\nalgebraically using Cartesian coordinates, named for its\ninventor Rene Descartes. These are defined with respect to a\ndistinguished point in the plane called the origin, denoted\n\\(O\\). Each point is specified by how far it is to the right of and\nabove \\(O\\), written as a pair of numbers. For example the pair (2.1,\n3.56) specifies the point 2.1 units to the right of \\(O\\), measured\nhorizontally, and 3.56 units above it, measured vertically; we call\n2.1 the \\(x\\) coordinate and 3.56 the \\(y\\) coordinate of that point.\nEither coordinate can be negative: the pair \\((-5, -1)\\) corresponds\nto the point 5 units to the left of \\(O\\) and 1 unit below it. The\npoint \\(O\\) itself is coordinatized as (0, 0).\n\nLines. Given an equation in variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), a\npoint such as (2, 7) is said to be a solution to that\nequation when setting \\(x\\) to 2 and \\(y\\) to 7 makes the equation\ntrue. For example the equation \\(y = 3x+5\\) has as solutions the\npoints (0, 5), (1, 8), (2, 11), and so on. Other solutions include\n(.5, 6.5), (1.5, 9.5), and so on. The set of all solutions constitutes\nthe unique straight line passing through (0, 5) and (1, 8). We then\ncall \\(y = 3x+5\\) the equation of that line.\n\nCircles. By Pythagoras\u2019s Theorem the square of the\ndistance between two points \\((x, y)\\) and \\((x', y')\\) is given by\n\\((x'-x)^2 +(y'-y)^2\\). As a special case of this, the square of the\ndistance of the point \\((x, y)\\) to the origin is \\(x^2 +y^2\\). It\nfollows that those point at distance \\(r\\) from the origin are the\nsolutions in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to the equation \\(x^2 +y^2 = r^2\\). But\nthese points are exactly those forming the circle of radius \\(r\\)\ncentered on \\(O\\). We identify this equation with this circle.\n\nVarieties The roots of any polynomial in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) form\na curve in the plane called a one-dimensional variety of\ndegree that of the polynomial. Thus lines are of degree 1,\nbeing expressed as polynomials \\(ax+by+c\\), while circles centered on\n\\((x', y')\\) are of degree 2, being expressed as polynomials\n\\((x-x')^2 +(y-y')^2 -r^2\\). Some varieties may contain no points, for\nexample \\(x^2 +y^2 +1\\), while others may contain one point, for\nexample \\(x^2 +y^2\\) having the origin as its one root. In general\nhowever a two-dimensional variety will be a curve. Such a curve may\ncross itself, or have a cusp, or even separate into two or more\ncomponents not connected to each other.\n\nSpace The two-dimensional plane is generalized to\nthree-dimensional space by adding to the variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) a\nthird variable \\(z\\) corresponding to the third dimension. The\nconventional orientation takes the first dimension to run from west to\neast, the second from south to north, and the third from below to\nabove. Points are then triples, for example the point \\((2, 5, -3)\\)\nis 2 units to the east of the origin, 5 units to the north of it, and\n3 units below it.\n\nPlanes and spheres. These are the counterparts in space of\nlines and circles in the plane. An equation such as \\(z = 3x + 2y\\)\ndefines not a straight line but rather a flat plane, in this case the\nunique plane passing through the points (0, 1, 2), (1, 0, 3), and (1,\n1, 5). And the sphere of radius \\(r\\) centered on the origin is given\nby \\(x^2 +y^2 +z^2 = r^2\\). The roots of a polynomial in \\(x, y\\) and\n\\(z\\) form a surface in space called a two-dimensional variety, of\ndegree that of the polynomial, just as for one-dimensional varieties.\nThus planes are of degree 1 and spheres of degree 2.\n\nThese methods generalize to yet higher dimensions by adding yet more\nvariables. Although the geometric space we experience physically is\nlimited to three dimensions, conceptually there is no limit to the\nnumber of dimensions of abstract mathematical space. Just as a line is\na one-dimensional subspace of the two-dimensional plane, and a plane\nis a two-dimensional subspace of three-dimensional space, each\nspecifiable with an equation, so is a hyperplane a\nthree-dimensional subspace of four-dimensional space, also specifiable\nwith an equation such as \\(w = 2x - 7y + z\\).\n",
