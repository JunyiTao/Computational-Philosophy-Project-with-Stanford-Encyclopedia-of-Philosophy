The former he calls the immediate object,\nand the later he calls the dynamic object. A neat way of\ncapturing this distinction is as the different objects arising from\nthe \u201ctwo answers to the question: what object does this sign\nrefer to? One is the answer that could be given when the sign was\nused; and the other is the one we could give when our scientific\nknowledge is complete\u201d. (Hookway 1985, 139).\n4.1.1 The Dynamic Object\n\nThe dynamic object is, in some senses, the object that generates a\nchain of signs. The aim of a sign chain is to arrive at a full\nunderstanding of an object and so assimilate that object into the\nsystem of signs. Using slightly more simplistic terms, Ransdell (1977,\n169) describes the dynamic object as the \u201cobject as it really\nis\u201d, and Hookway (1985, 139) describes it as \u201cthe object\nas it is known to be [at the end of inquiry]\u201d. Indeed, Hookway\u2019s\ndescription shows an acute awareness of the connection between the\ndynamic object and the process of inquiry in Peirce\u2019s later sign\ntheory. An example, from Liszka (1996, 23), captures Peirce\u2019s idea\nquite clearly: taking a petroleum tank half full with fuel, a variety\nof signs for this half-full state are available. Perhaps there is a\nfuel gauge attached to the tank, or perhaps the tank makes a\ndistinctive sound when we strike it and so on. But, despite these\nvarious signs, the object underlying them all is the actual level of\nfuel in the petroleum tank; this is the dynamic object.\n4.1.2 The Immediate Object\n\nRansdell (1977, 169) describes the immediate object as \u201cwhat we,\nat any time, suppose the object to be\u201d, and Hookway (1985, 139)\ndescribes it as \u201cthe object at the time it is first used and\ninterpreted\u201d. The immediate object, then, is not some additional\nobject distinct from the dynamic object but is merely some\ninformationally incomplete facsimile of the dynamic object generated\nat some interim stage in a chain of signs. Returning to the petroleum\ntank example, when we strike the tank, the tone that it emits (which\nfunctions as the sign-vehicle) represents to us that the tank is not\nfull (but it does not tell us the precise level of fuel). The\nimmediate object, then, is a less-than-full-tank.\n\nClearly, the immediate and dynamic objects of a sign are intimately\nlinked and Peirce consistently describes and introduces the two\ntogether. (See CP 4. 536 1896). However, the connection between\nthe two is most clear when we consider the connections between sign\nchains and inquiry. The dynamic object is, as we have suggested, the\ngoal and end point that drives the semiotic process, and the immediate\nobject is our grasp of that object at any point in that process.\nRansdell, for instance, says:\n\n[T]he immediate object is the object as it appears at any point in the\ninquiry or semiotic process. The [dynamic] object, however, is the\nobject as it really is. These must be distinguished, first, because\nthe immediate object may involve some erroneous interpretation and\nthus be to that extent falsely representative of the object as it\nreally is, and, second, because it may fail to include something that\nis true of the real object. In other words, the immediate object is\nsimply what we at any time suppose the real object to be. (Ransdell\n1977, 169)\n\n\nPut this way, it is clear how Peirce\u2019s growing concern to capture the\nparallels between semiosis and the process of inquiry leads him to\nidentify two objects for the sign.\n",
