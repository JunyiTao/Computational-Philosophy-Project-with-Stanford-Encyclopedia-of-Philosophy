    "main_text": "Death || Criteria for Death\n2.7 Criteria for Death\n\nDefining death is one thing; providing criteria by which it can be\nreadily detected or verified is another. A definition is an account of\nwhat death is; when, and only when its definition is met,\ndeath has necessarily occurred. A criterion for death, by contrast,\nlays out conditions by which all and only actual deaths may\nbe readily identified. In some cases criteria for death are intended\nto capture conditions by which the actual deaths of human\npersons may be identified. Such a criterion falls short of a\ndefinition, but plays a practical role. For example, criteria for the\ndeath of a person would help physicians and jurists determine when\ndeath has occurred.\n\nIn the United States, the states have adopted criteria for the death\nof a person modeled on the Uniform Determination of Death Act\n(developed by the President\u2019s Commission, 1981), which says that\n\u201can individual who has sustained either (1) irreversible\ncessation of circulatory and respiratory functions, or (2)\nirreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including\nthe brain stem, is dead. A determination of death must be made in\naccordance with accepted medical standards.\u201d In the United\nKingdom, the accepted criterion is brain stem death, or the\n\u201cpermanent functional death of the brain stem\u201d (Pallis\n1982).\n\nThese current criteria are subject to criticism, even if we put aside\nreservations concerning the qualifier \u2018irreversible\u2019.\nAnimalists might resist the criteria since the vital activities of\nhuman beings whose entire brains have ceased to function can be\nsustained artificially using cardiopulmonary assistance. Mindists and\npersonists might also resist the criteria, on the grounds that minds\nand all psychological features can be destroyed in human beings whose\nbrain stems are intact. For example, cerebral death can leave its\nvictim with an intact brain stem, yet mindless and devoid of\nself-awareness. (For more on criteria for death, see the article on\nthe Definition of Death.)\n",
