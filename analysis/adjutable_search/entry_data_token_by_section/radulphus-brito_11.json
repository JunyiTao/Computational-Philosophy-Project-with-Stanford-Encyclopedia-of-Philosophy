    "main_text": "Metaphysics || The Science of Metaphysics\n6.1 The Science of Metaphysics\n\nAssuming that Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics (Met.)\nis a systematic account of a particular subject, Brito follows the\nmajority of medieval commentators by beginning his inquiry with the\nquestion \u201cWhat is the subject matter of metaphysics?\u201d. In\nthe first question of the first book he asks whether the subject\nmatter of metaphysics is being. Traditionally, the question arises\nbecause of Aristotle\u2019s treatment of: \n\n(i) being in general in\nMet. \u0393 1\u20132 and E 1; \n(ii)  being as applied\nprimarily to first substances in Met. Z\u2013\u039e; and\n\n(iii)  being as applied\nto the causes of being in Met.. A 1\u20132, E 1 and\n\u039b. \n\n\nTherefore, it seems necessary to determine whether the proper subject\nmatter of metaphysics is: \n\n(i)  being in general;\n\n(ii)  first substances;\nor \n(iii)  separate\nsubstances. \n\n\nDepending on which subject matter is posited, metaphysics would be\nconsidered \n\n(i\u2032) as a science\nabout what it is to be; \n(ii\u2032) as a\nscience about material things; or \n(iii\u2032) as a\nscience akin to theology.\n\n\nIn his solution to the question, Brito considers only positions (i)\nand (iii), the first of which he attributes to Avicenna and the second\nto Averroes. He sides with Avicenna and supports his position with\nboth authoritative and epistemological arguments: the subject matter\nof metaphysics is being, not only because Aristotle says so in\nMet. \u0393.1.1003a20\u201323, but also because, just as\nthe science of being must do, the Metaphysics deals with the\nparts and attributes of being in general (e.g., in its discussion of\nfirst substances, form and matter, truth and unity, etc.), as well as\nwith its causes and principles (e.g., in its discussion of the causes\nof being in Metaphysics. A and E) (QMet: I.1).\n\nAverroes\u2019 position is dismissed for epistemological reasons:\nfirst, metaphysics cannot be equated with theology, because the latter\nmust posit God and proceed to the demonstration of his attributes, but\nMet. E presumably contains an inquiry into God\u2019s\nexistence. Second, metaphysics is not the science of separate\nsubstances, because the inquiry into the notion of being is also\nconcerned with material substances (QMet: I.1).\n",
