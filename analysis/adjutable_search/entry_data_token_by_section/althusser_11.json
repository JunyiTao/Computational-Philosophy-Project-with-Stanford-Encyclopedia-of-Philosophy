First, with the idea that human individuals are merely\none of the sites at which the contradictory productive forces that\ncharacterize an era are enacted, Althusser signals that the primary\nobject of social philosophy is not the human individual. Second, with\nthe idea that the state produced by political activity is merely one\nproductive process among others, Althusser signals that the primary\nelement in political philosophy is not the state. Though both states\nand individuals are important elements of the socio-economic whole,\nnothing philosophical is learned by examining the essence of the\nindividual or the way in which justice is embodied by the state.\n\nAs Althusser understands them, whatever conceptions we have of the\nnature of human beings or about the proper function of the state are\nhistorically generated and serve to reproduce existing social\nrelations. In other words, they are ideological. Apart from the\nnecessity of human beings to engage in productive relations with other\nhuman beings and with their environment in order to produce their\nmeans of subsistence, there is no human nature or essence. This is the\ncore of Althusser\u2019s \u201canti-humanist\u201d position.\nFurther, though some order must exist in order to allow for the\nproduction and reproduction of social life, there is no essential or\nbest form that this order must take. This is not to say that human\nbeings do not conceive of or strive for the best order for social life\nor that they do not believe that they are essentially free or equal\nand deserving of rights. It also does not mean that all of our ideas\nare homogenous and that heterogeneous ideas about what is best cannot\nexist side by side in the same system without leading to conflict\n(though they sometimes do). However, the science of Historical\nMaterialism has revealed the desire for such orders to be historically\ngenerated along with the ideas about human nature that justify\nthem.\n\nThis account of the ideological role of our conceptions of human\nnature and of the best political arrangement shows Althusser to differ\nlittle from interpretations of Marx which hold that political\nideologies are the product of and serve existing economic relations.\nHowever, and as was detailed above, Althusser rejects the simple\nunderstanding of causality offered by this model in which economic\npractices order consciousness and our cultural practices. He also\nrejects the philosophy of history that often accompanies this model.\nThis philosophy has it that certain economic practices not only\ngenerate corresponding cultural practices, but that there is a pattern\nto economic development in which each economic order inexorably leads\nto its own demise and replacement by a different economic system. In\nthis understanding of history, feudalism must lead to capitalism and\ncapitalism to socialism. Althusser, however, argues against the idea\nthat history has a subject (such as the economy or human agency) and\nthat history has a goal (such as communism or human freedom). History,\nfor Althusser, is a process without a subject. There are patterns and\norders to historical life and there is historical change. However,\nthere is no necessity to any of these transformations and history does\nnot necessarily progress. Transformations do occur. However, they do\nso only when the contradictions and levels of development inherent in\na mode of production allow for such change.\n",
