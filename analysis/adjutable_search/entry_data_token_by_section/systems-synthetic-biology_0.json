    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nSystems biology and synthetic biology are relatively recent\ninterdisciplinary approaches that aim to improve our ability to\nunderstand, predict, and control living systems. They both capitalize\non large-scale data production in genomics and related fields and\nexplore new paths of cross-fertilization between biology and\nnon-biological disciplines such as physics, computer science,\nmathematics, chemistry, and engineering. Systems and synthetic biology\nare often described as \u2018sister-disciplines\u2019 or\n\u2018cousins\u2019, focusing on the complementary and interrelated\naims of understanding (systems biology) and\ndesigning (synthetic biology) living systems. Accordingly,\nthey have been associated with knowledge-driven versus\napplication-driven epistemologies, or with the aims of analysis versus\nsynthesis. Philosophers of science examining the research practice\nhave, however, argued that understanding and design are often\ninterdependent, and that no simple distinction between basic and\napplied science can be made in this context (Kastenhofer 2013a,b;\nKnuuttila & Loettgers 2013a; O\u2019Malley 2009). Moreover, the\nnotions of systems and synthetic biology cover broad and highly\ndiverse spectra of interdisciplinary hybrids (Calvert & Fujimura\n2011; Gramelsberger et al. 2013). This entry will therefore aim to\nreach a balance between displaying the methodological flexibility and\nvariability within these fields and highlighting common themes.\n",
