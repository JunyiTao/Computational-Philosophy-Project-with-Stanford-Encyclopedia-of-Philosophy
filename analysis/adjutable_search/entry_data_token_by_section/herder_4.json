    "main_text": "Philosophy of Language, Interpretation, and Translation || Philosophy of Language: Language, Thought, Meaning\n4.1 Philosophy of Language: Language, Thought, Meaning\n\nAlready in the mid-1760s\u2014for example, in On Diligence in\nSeveral Learned Languages (1764) and the Fragments\n(1767\u20138)\u2014Herder began advancing three fundamental theses\nin this area:\n\nThought is essentially dependent on, and bounded in scope by,\nlanguage\u2014i.e., one can only think if one has a language, and one\ncan only think what one can express linguistically. (This thesis is\nalready prominent in On Diligence and in the\nFragments. To his credit, Herder normally refrains from\nadvancing a more extreme, but philosophically untenable, version of\nthe thesis, favored by some of his successors, that simply\nidentifies thought with language, or with inner\nlanguage.)\nMeanings or concepts are\u2014not the sorts of things, in\nprinciple autonomous of language, with which much of the philosophical\ntradition has equated them, e.g., the referents involved (Augustine),\nPlatonic forms, or subjective mental ideas \u00e0 la Locke or Hume,\nbut instead\u2014usages of words. (This thesis is already\nprominent in the Fragments. Herder also develops important\narguments for it.)\nConceptualization is intimately bound up with (perceptual and\naffective) sensation. More precisely, Herder develops a\nquasi-empiricist theory of concepts that holds that sensation is the\nsource and basis of all our concepts, but that there is also a\nconverse dependence and that we are able to achieve non-empirical\nconcepts by means of metaphorical extensions from the empirical\nones\u2014so that all of our concepts ultimately depend on sensation\nin one way or another. (For this thesis, see esp. Treatise on the\nOrigin, On the Cognition and Sensation, and the\nMetacritique.)\n\n\nThe first two of these theses dramatically overturned the sort of\ndualistic picture of the relation between language, on the one hand,\nand thought/meaning, on the other, that had predominated during the\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries. They thereby essentially founded\nthe philosophy of language as we still know it today.\n\nHamann has often been credited with introducing something like these\ntwo revolutionary theses and then passing them on to Herder (e.g., by\nIsaiah Berlin). But that is a mistake; Herder was already committed to\nthem by the mid-1760s, Hamann only later and under Herder\u2019s\ninfluence.\n\nThe third thesis, quasi-empiricism, would be far less widely accepted\nby philosophers of language today. However, it may well be correct\ntoo. Contrary to first appearances, it need not conflict with thesis\n(2), the equation of meanings with word-usages. And the most likely\nmodern ground for skepticism about it, namely, a\nFregean-Wittgensteinian anti-psychologism concerning meaning that is\npopular today, may well itself be mistaken.\n\nIn addition to making a fundamental contribution to the philosophy of\nlanguage, these three theses also underpin Herder\u2019s theories of\ninterpretation and translation (as we are about to see).\n",
