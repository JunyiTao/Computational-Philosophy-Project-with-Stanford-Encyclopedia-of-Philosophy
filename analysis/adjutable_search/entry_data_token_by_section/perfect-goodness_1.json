Perfect goodness as a necessary or contingent feature of the absolutely perfect being\n\nWhat is the modality with which perfect goodness is exhibited by an\nabsolutely perfect being? Is any absolutely perfect being\nnecessarily perfectly good, or is such a being only\ncontingently perfectly morally good? (The necessity in\nquestion here is de re; it is far less controversial that it\nis a de dicto necessary truth that an absolutely perfect\nbeing is perfectly good.) One might think that an absolutely perfect\nbeing must be essentially perfectly good, for a being who is perfectly\ngood in all possible worlds is better than a being who is perfectly\ngood in only some worlds. This is the standard thinking behind the\nidea that the divine perfections are exhibited by God not only\ncontingently, but necessarily: a perfect being is not only omniscient,\nbut necessarily omniscient; a perfect being is not only omnipotent,\nbut necessarily omnipotent; and so forth. As it is better to have a\nperfection necessarily rather than only contingently, if having some\nfeature is a perfection, then having that feature necessarily is a\nperfection as well. \n\nBut this argument is not decisive. It works only if having the\nperfection in question necessarily is itself a coherent notion, and it\nmay be that there is some sort of incoherence involved in the notion\nof necessary perfect goodness that is not involved in the notion of\nperfect goodness simpliciter. (For an endorsement of this\nline of argument, with a recognition of the needed qualification, see\nMorris 1989d, p. 63\u201365.) Some arguments to this conclusion are\nconsidered below. One might, then, argue that the best that a being\ncould possibly exhibit with respect to perfect goodness would be to\nactually, though only contingently, exhibit it. \n\nSome defenders of perfect being theology have suggested that it is\nantithetical to the very idea of perfect being theology that there be\nperfections that could be exemplified only contingently. It is true\nthat certain ambitions that some perfect being theologians have\nharbored \u2013 for example, to provide an a priori\nargument, in the style of Anselm\u2019s ontological argument, for the\nexistence of an absolutely perfect being \u2013 would have to be\nabandoned if any divine perfection is exhibited at most contingently\n(Guleserian 1985). (Even if there are some sound a priori\narguments for contingent truths, this sort of proof of God\u2019s\nexistence is not a case in which this is a live possibility.) An\nabsolutely perfect being might exist, and even exist necessarily, but\nit would not be essential to it that it is an absolutely perfect\nbeing. (That is, if A is an absolutely perfect being, then\nA might exist necessarily, but it would not be necessary both\nthat A exists and is absolutely perfect.)\n\nSome defenders of perfect being theology have ridiculed the idea that\nan absolutely perfect being might be only contingently perfectly good,\nfor even if a being were to exhibit all of the marks of perfect\ngoodness up to a certain time, we would have no basis to think that\nthe absolutely perfect being would not break bad at some point in the\nfuture (Rogers 2000, p. 122). But it is not clear why the contingency\nof the fact\u2019s (the being\u2019s being perfectly good)\nholding precludes our knowing that it holds; and it is very plausible\nthat perfect goodness is, for God at least, what Morris calls a\n\u201cstable\u201d property, such that if God has it at some time in\na world, then God has it at all times in that world (Morris 1989e, pp.\n92\u201397).\n\nIf we were to become convinced that necessary perfect goodness is\nincoherent, it is unclear why we should take that to be any more\nproblematic for the notion that God is perfectly good than our\nbecoming convinced that water is necessarily identical to\nH2O would be for the notion that God\u2019s perfection\nincludes omnipotence. Just as we do not take God\u2019s omnipotence\nto be threatened by God\u2019s not being able to make water that is\nnot H\u00ad2O, we need not take God\u2019s perfect goodness\nto be threatened by the fact that God cannot exhibit that feature\nnecessarily. If the upper limit of perfect goodness is to have it\ncontingently, then it is not as if a being who is actually morally\nperfect is surpassable in moral goodness merely by having its perfect\nmoral goodness only contingently. (Though see Carter 1982 and Garcia\n1987 for attempts to show that God cannot be contingently morally\nperfect; on these views, God is either essentially morally perfect or\nessentially morally defective.)\n",
