    "main_text": "Life & Times\n2. Life & Times\n\nWilhelm Maximilian Wundt was born on August 16, 1832, in the German\ntown of Neckarau, outside of Mannheim, the son of a Lutheran minister\n(Titchener 1921b: 161). The family moved when Wilhelm was six to the\ntown of Heidenheim, in central Baden (Boring 1950: 316). By all\naccounts, he was a precocious, peculiar boy, schooled mainly by his\nfather\u2019s assistant, the vicar, Friedrich M\u00fcller; young\nWilhelm was so attached to M\u00fcller that he moved in with him when\nthe latter got a post in a neighboring village (Boring 1950: 316).\nWundt studied at the Gymnasien at Bruchsal and Heidelberg and\nentered the University of T\u00fcbingen at 19, in 1851 (Boring 1950:\n317). After one year he transferred to the University of Heidelberg,\nwhere he majored in medicine. By his third year, his intense work\nethic yielded his first publication (Boring 1950: 318). Nevertheless,\ndoctoring was not Wundt\u2019s vocation and he turned instead to\nphysiology, which he studied for a semester under Johannes M\u00fcller\n(the \u201cfather of experimental physiology\u201d) at Berlin\n(Boring 1950: 318). In 1856, at the age of 24, Wundt took his\ndoctorate in medicine at Heidelberg, and habilitated as a\nDozent in physiology. Two years later, the physicist,\nphysiologist, and psychologist, Hermann von\n Helmholtz,[6]\n received the call to Heidelberg as a professor of physiology, a\ndecisive moment for Wundt\u2019s career, with Wundt working as\nHelmholtz\u2019s assistant from 1858 until 1865 (Boring 1950: 300,\n319; Araujo 2014: 55).\n\nWhen Helmholtz moved to Berlin in 1871, Wundt was passed over as\nHelmholtz\u2019s replacement; three years later he took the chair in\n\u201cinductive philosophy\u201d at the University of Z\u00fcrich.\nHe remained at Z\u00fcrich for only one year before receiving an\nappointment to \u201ca first-class chair of philosophy at Leipzig in\n1875\u201d (Ben-David and Collins 1966: 462). Leipzig\u2019s\nphilosophy department, dominated by Herbartians, provided the ideal\nenvironment for his intellectual flowering, the soil having been\nprepared by Fechner, Weber, and Lotze (Littman 1979: 74; cf. Kim\n2009). Wundt became famous at Leipzig. It was here, in 1879, that the\nuniversity formally recognized his little room of equipment as a\nbona fide laboratory, the world\u2019s first devoted to\n psychology.[7]\n Students flocked to\n Wundt,[8]\n and while he set the tone and direction of research, it was largely\nthey who constructed apparatus, performed experiments, and published\nresults.\n\n\nEnrollment in his courses doubled about every 15 years, reaching a\npeak of 620 students in the summer of 1912. Wundt ended up sponsoring\n186 Ph.D. dissertations, about a third of which apparently involved\npurely philosophical topics (Tinker, 1932). (Quote\u2014including\nreference to Tinker\u2013from Hearst 1979b: 22)\n\n\nThough Wundt participated actively in labor politics in his early\nyears at Heidelberg, even being elected to the Baden parliament, he\nsteadily drifted rightwards, eventually being persuaded by his\n\u201cvirulently\n anti-Semitic\u201d[9]\n son, Max, a historian of philosophy, to join the ultranationalist\nDeutsche Philosophische Gesellschaft, after\n 1917.[10]\n It is hard to ignore Wundt\u2019s unattractive\n\u201capplication\u201d of his late social and cultural psychology\nto the tendentious critique of Germany\u2019s enemies (Kusch 1995:\n220\u20131). Nevertheless, his drive and unflagging intellectual\nadvocacy will arouse admiration in some: even at age 80, he remained\ninvolved in academic\n controversy.[11]\n But let us consider the man through his work.\n\nTo understand Wundt\u2019s philosophical importance one must know\nsomething of his intellectual context. Early nineteenth-century German\npsychology labored under the looming shadow of Kant and his arguments\nthat a science of psychology is in principle impossible. This fact by\nitself illustrates the oddity of the situation, from our point of\nview: why would a psychologist care what a philosopher thought about\nhis practice? The answer is that since ancient times, psychology had\nbeen a basic part of philosophical speculation, though after\nKant\u2019s criticisms many considered it a dying branch, dangerously\nclose to breaking off. Psychologists were philosophers on the\ndefensive (cf. L III: 163).\n\nPsychology, as a part of philosophy, had already several times changed\nthe way it defined its object: as \u201csoul\u201d, \u201cmental\nsubstance\u201d, \u201cmind\u201d, etc. By the late eighteenth and\nearly nineteenth centuries, many regarded psychology to be the account\nof consciousness or \u201cinner experience\u201d, distinct from the\nnatural scientific accounts of external, sensible reality. After\nhaving dealt the coup de gr\u00e2ce to the speculative,\nrational, a priori psychology of the soul epitomized by\nChristian Wolff, however, Kant tried to cut off any retreat into the\nempirical study of consciousness, as well. In the Metaphysical\nFoundations of Natural Science, he argued that empirical\npsychology cannot be an exact science because the phenomena it seeks\nto explain are not mathematically expressible (Kitcher 1990: 11).\nMoreover, it can never become an experimental science \u201cbecause\nit is not possible to isolate different thoughts\u201d (Kitcher 1990:\n11). Finally, and most fatally, the only access to the phenomena of\ninner experience, introspection, ipso facto alters those\nphenomena: if I try, by introspection, to study what it\u2019s like\nto be tristful, the phenomena of my sadness are now something\ndifferent, namely, phenomena of my sadness-being-studied-by-me\n(Kitcher 1990: 11). Thus psychologists found their object declared\nbeyond the limit of possible investigation and their methods vain.\nWhile such arguments did not persuade all of Kant\u2019s successors\nof the hopelessness of their enterprise, their attempts were\nunpromising. On the one hand, the German Idealists\u2019 fanciful\nspeculation about Geist collapsed upon itself. On the other\nhand, the efforts of\n J.F. Herbart\n to devise a mathematical mental mechanics suggested a possible way\nforward although in the end it proved equally fruitless. Thus, for\nthose mid-nineteenth-century enthusiasts of mental phenomena, the\nfuture of a genuine psychology seemed blocked.\n\nAt the same time, however, progress was being made in human\nphysiology, especially of the sensory systems. In 1834, the\nphysiologist, E.H. Weber, published a startling discovery in his\nDe tactu. His experiments on the sensation of weight had led\nhim to find that there obtains a constant ratio between, on the one\nhand, a given stimulus and, on the other hand, a second stimulus\nsufficiently larger for the difference between the two stimuli to be\njust noticeable, no matter the magnitude of the first\n stimulus.[12]\n In other words, if the first stimulus is of intensity \\(I\\), then\n\\(\\Delta I\\) is the amount by which it must be increased for the\ndifference to be just noticeable; the ratio of \\(I\\) and \\(\\Delta I\\)\nis constant (\\(k\\)): \\(\\Delta I / I = k\\) (cf. L III: 186).\nThis equation, which later came to be known as Weber\u2019s\n Law,[13]\n was crucial to the development of psychology because it apparently\ndemonstrated that where Herbart had failed in his aprioristic\nconstruction of mathematical regularities of mind, experimentation\ncould succeed. The situation nevertheless remained murky as\ninterpretations of Weber\u2019s Law multiplied. Fechner, for example,\nelaborated Weber\u2019s experiments but took his results as the basis\nfor an arcane panpsychic monism (Wundt\u2019s own\n\u201cpsychological\u201d interpretation is treated in\n Section 4)\n (cf., e.g., Boring 1950: 286).\n\nIn founding the experimental science of psychology, Wundt in effect\n\u201ctriangulated\u201d a media via between the available\noptions: he rejected Fechner\u2019s mysticism while maintaining his\nexperimental approach; at the same time, Wundt went beyond the purely\nphysical interpretation of physiological experiments \u00e0 la\nHelmholtz, arguing that at least in humans experimentation could\nreveal law-like regularities of inner (psychological)\nreality. Thus, to use the phrase of Ben-David and Collins, he\nestablished the \u201chybrid science\u201d whose dual provenance is\nexpressed in Wundt\u2019s name for it, \u201cphysiological\npsychology\u201d (Ben-David and Collins 1966: 459; Kusch 1995: 122,\n ff.).[14]\n Wundt\u2019s interest, both to scholars of the history of philosophy\nand to contemporary philosophers of mind, flows ultimately from the\ndefinition, methodology, and \u201cmetaphysics\u201d of this\nphysiological psychology. Sections\n 3\n and\n 4\n are devoted to a description of its definition, method, and doctrine,\nwhile\n Section 5\n is concerned with its theoretical underpinnings. The practical and\ntheoretical limits of experimental psychology will be treated in\n Section 6,\n on V\u00f6lkerpsychologie.\n",
