Malebranche and Cavendish\n\n\nThe battle between the Cartesians and their opponents in the latter\nhalf of the seventeenth century was one of the great struggles in the\nhistory of philosophy, but it was one in which the lines were not\nclearly drawn. For, although those in the Cartesian camp claimed the\nbanner of Descartes, there were as many differences among them as\nbetween them and their opponents. Perhaps the most important\ndifference among them hinged on whether or not they accepted\nDescartes\u2019s doctrine of created truth. Desgabets and his student\nR\u00e9gis were the most important among the few who did accept the\ndoctrine. Along with their acceptance of the doctrine, however, came\nnascent tendencies toward empiricism. On the other hand, Malebranche,\nthe most notable among the Cartesians who rejected the doctrine of\ncreated truth, developed a philosophical system with a purer\nrationalistic character than Descartes\u2019s own. Descartes had\nadvised his followers to follow not him but their own\nreason. Malebranche, like other heterodox Cartesians, justified his\ndifferences from Descartes as the result of following this\ninjunction. On his view, his rejection of the doctrine of created\ntruth followed from his commitment to other, deeper views in\nDescartes. He thus represented himself as more Cartesian than\nDescartes himself.\n\n\nThe philosophy of Malebranche is sometimes portrayed as a synthesis of\nDescartes and Augustine, but a more precise way to put this relation\nis that Malebranche used Augustine to rectify shortcomings he\nperceived in the philosophy of Descartes. Chief among these was\nDescartes\u2019s theory of ideas, which, according to Malebranche,\nnot only fails to reflect human beings\u2019 proper dependence on God\nbut also leads inevitably to skepticism. Initially, Malebranche\nthought that he agreed with Descartes\u2019s theory, but in the long\ndebate over the nature of ideas he had with Arnauld, who held a close\nversion of Descartes\u2019s theory, Malebranche came to see a need\nfor a different account.\n\n\nNot implausibly, Arnauld took Descartes\u2019s claim about the\nambiguity of the term \u201cidea\u201d to mean that\n\u201cidea\u201d, or \u201cperception\u201d, refers to one and the\nsame thing, a thing which stands in two different relations. Insofar\nas it is related to what is known, it is called an idea; insofar as it\nis related to the mind, it is called a perception. This (act of)\nperception he took to be related to the mind as a mode of it. It is at\nthis point that Malebranche detected the threat of skepticism. What we\nknow, indeed what we know in the most important instances of\nknowledge, is universal, necessary, and infinite, as in the case of\ncertain mathematical knowledge. But nothing that is the mode of a\nparticular, contingent and finite mind can be universal, necessary or\ninfinite. If ideas were modes of the mind, then we would not have such\nknowledge; but since we do have such knowledge, ideas must be\nsomething else.  Malebranche argued that the only being in which such\nideas could exist is God. Following Augustine, he took ideas to be the\nexemplars in the mind of God after which He creates the world. This\nconstrual had the additional advantage for Malebranche of guarding\nagainst skepticism because, although idea and object are no longer\nidentical, they are nonetheless necessarily connected as exemplar and\nexemplum. Even so, it remained true for Malebranche that, when we look\nat a material thing, what we in fact see is not that thing but its\nidea. This is the core of his view of \u201cvision of all things in\nGod\u201d, which he welcomed as an indication of human beings\u2019\ndependence on the deity. The immediate vehicle whereby we have such\nknowledge is a particular, contingent, and finite mode of the mind;\nbut the universal, necessary, and infinite object of that mode can\nexist only in some other kind of being. How are these ideas known to\nthe mind if they are not in it, at least not as modes of it? Although\nideas are not innate to the mind, for that would make them modes of\nit, they are nonetheless always present to it. In seeking to know,\nwhether we realize it or not, we are consulting Reason, which\nMalebranche identifies with the second person of the Trinity,\nthe logos of Neoplatonic theology. Our effort to know is a\n\u201cnatural prayer\u201d that Reason always answers.\n\n\nAs for individual substances, Malebranche clearly thought that every\nmaterial thing and every mind is a substance in the sense of a\nhypokeimenon. But when pressed late in his life to show how\nthis status for them comported with the rest of his system, how they\ncould be anything but modes of a single substance, in short how he\navoided the drift into Spinozistic monism, he was in fact hard\npressed.  In the Search After Truth, Malebranche clearly\ncommitted himself to the view that everything is either a substance or\na mode. In addition, he accepted Descartes\u2019s criterion for a\nsubstance that it be conceivable apart from everything else. However,\nhe maintained that any given portion of extension is conceivable apart\nfrom the rest of extension and is thus a substance. (Descartes did not\nthink this, otherwise void space would be possible for him.) Since\nextension is conceptually divisible to infinity, Malebranche is\ncommitted to an infinite number of extended substances. Apart from the\nwhole of extension, moreover, every substance contains an infinite\nnumber of substances, of (each of) which it is a mode. It is also a\npart of an infinite number of substances, which are modes of it. The\nexplanatory value of the concept of substance would seem to have been\nlost with such results as these. Malebranche\u2019s view seems to be\na degenerate version of Descartes\u2019s texts to the effect,\nsurprising but coherent, that there is but one material\nsubstance, res extensa, whose modes are particular material\nthings. Here the effect is to reverse the Aristotelian logic of\nsubstance. To say of \\(x\\), a particular thing, that it is extended\n\\(E\\), is to say not that a substance \\(x\\) has a property \\(E\\), but\nthat \\(x\\) is a mode of\nres extensa.\n\n\nThese difficulties in accounting for substance on Malebranche\u2019s\npart seem to derive from his Platonism. As a Platonist, he was\ninterested less in substance as the hypokeimenon, which\naccounts for difference, than in its other sense of ousia,\nwhich accounts for sameness. Thus, Malebranche\u2019s skid to\nSpinozism is greased even when he talks about mind, the essence of\nwhich is thought\u2014not this or that thought, \u201cbut\nsubstantial thought, thought capable of all sorts of modifications or\nthoughts\u201d. Since the same substantial thought is had by all\npossessed of a mind, Malebranche\u2019s view smacks even of the\nsingle intellectual soul for all human beings of the Latin\nAverroists. In this sense too, then, his heterodoxy as a Cartesian is\npart and parcel with his deep commitment to rationalism, and in\nparticular with his rationalistic reduction of phenomenal difference\nto real sameness.\n\n\nThe final rationalistic aspect of Malebranche\u2019s thought that\ndeserves attention here is his theory of causation. For Malebranche, a\ncause is that between which and whose effect there is a necessary\nconnection. On his view, the causal connection that is characterized by\nthis kind of necessity is that between God\u2019s will and its effects.\nThus, for Malebranche, only God has causal efficacy. What we take to be\nreal causes\u2014for example the motion of a billiard ball that\ncollides with another that then begins to move\u2014are in fact only\noccasional causes, the occasions for the operation of the only real\ncause.\n\n\nA cousin of Malebranche\u2019s occasionalism is worth noting here.\nMargaret Cavendish agrees with Malebranche that bodies do not cause\nchange in one another, but she disagrees with him about whether nature\nis self-moving. Where Malebranche takes created things to possess no\ncausal power at all, Cavendish takes them to possess the power of\nself-motion. On her view, when bodies interact, there is no transfer\nof motion. Cavendish\u2019s commitment to this view is grounded in\nher belief that properties cannot be transferred between\nbodies. Because motion is a property, she argues, motion cannot be\ntransferred between bodies. Following this line of reasoning, when\nbodies come into contact, they act as occasional causes, that is,\ncauses that merely occasion a change. In an interaction, one body will\nserve as occasional cause, and the second body will serve as a\n\u201cprincipal\u201d cause, which brings about, in itself, the\n appropriate effect (see Detlefsen 2006 and the entry on\n Cavendish).\n Both thinkers also hold the view, ubiquitous in the period, that motion\nis issued into the created world as a result of God\u2019s willing it.\nCavendish is careful to note that this issuance is the result not of\n\u201can immediate action of God\u201d but rather by an\n\u201call-powerful command\u201d (Cavendish, 209). She rejects the\nformer option on the grounds that such continual, immediate action is\nunsuitable to \u201can immovable and immutable essence\u201d\n(Cavendish, 209). On this point, she and Malebranche are in\nagreement.\n\n\nThe difference in the way that they conceive of occasional causation\nis in how they understand the content of the \u201call-powerful\ncommand\u201d that introduces motion into the system. On\nMalebranche\u2019s view, a true cause is one where we can perceive a\nnecessary connection between it and its effect. The only candidate for\nsuch a connection is between the infinite will as cause, and its\neffects. Moreover, he seems to also endorse the claim that for a cause\nto bring out its effect, it must possess the knowledge of how to bring\nit about. In the case of the relationship between a finite mind and\nthe body to which it is joined, our ignorance of how the mind\n\u201ccauses\u201d the body to move is enough to deny that there is\ncausal connection. In short, only God has the required knowledge to\neffect these kinds of changes. These arguments undergird the central\nMalebranchean commitment: the utter dependence of all created things\non God. As such, it makes sense, on his system, to deny causal\nefficacy to anything other than God. Such a denial of causal efficacy\nentrenches the dependence of created things on their creator.\n\n\nCavendish tells a different kind of story here. She notes that those\nwho show discomfort with the notion that God, through His command,\ngave the power of self-motion to all created things, are clouded by\ntheir \u201cambition\u201d (Cavendish, 209). Ambition leads certain\nthinkers to imagine that the immaterial substance of their souls is\nthe only created thing that possesses self-motion. On this\nunderstanding of causation, they feel closer to God, who is radically\nself-moving, and superior to material things, which do not possess the\nability to self-move. However, Cavendish notes, the decree from God\nthat introduces motion into the created world is just as easily\nimparted to material things as to immaterial things. As such, there is\nno reason to suppose that He did not give the power of self-motion to\nmaterial things.\n\n\nCavendish\u2019s criticism of those whose ambition clouds the way\nthey think about self-motion does not apply to Malebranche, however.\nFor, on his view, no created thing, human souls included, possesses\nthe power to self-move. Given Malebranche\u2019s combined\nrationalistic and theological commitments, none of this is\nsurprising. The surprise, or at least irony, comes when\nMalebranche\u2019s arguments that natural causes\u2014even and\nespecially human volitions\u2014cannot be real causes cross the\nchannel and are deployed by Hume. The radical empiricist account of\ncausation that Hume gave in terms of constant conjunction is just\nMalebranche\u2019s rationalist occasionalism without the role\nassigned to God. For Hume, Malebranche\u2019s occasional causes are\nthe only causes.\n",
