    "main_text": "Ethics: Norms and Values || New sources and lecture notes discovered\n3.1 New sources and lecture notes discovered\n\n\nNew research on Mally\u2019s philosophy in general, ethics, and\nlogic of norms has brought forward so far unknown material.\nMally\u2019s unpublished work in the Library Archives of the\nUniversity of Graz contains a number of philosophical texts and\npersonal documents as well as private letters. Some lecture notes by\nMally himself seem to be of particular relevance, partly laid down in\nillegible shorthand. Yet some lecture notes have been edited by his\nstudents in manuscript form, especially the lecture notes of some\nVorlesungen between 1926 and 1938. It is to be expected that\nmore research work in the years to come will shed more light onto\nMally\u2019s philosophical work and development. There are new indications\ncontained in those manuscripts that promise a deeper understanding of\nMally\u2019s post-Meinongian philosophy, in particular his ethics and\ndeontic logic. Recently, Markus Roschitz published a book on Mally\u2019s\npost-Meinongian philosophy (Roschitz 2016b). He mainly discusses Mally\n1935 (Erlebnis und Wirklichkeit), which Mally himself called\n\u201cZauberbuch\u201d (\u201cmagical book\u201d).\nRoschitz (2016b, Chapter 5) describes Mally\u2019s four parts of a new\nontology and epistemology: (1) forms of objects and thinking, (2)\nreality and empirical knowledge, (3) sense and spirit, and (4) the\nlife of the soul. Mally\u2019s three key notions for his ontological\ndiscussion of everything there is, concrete as well as abstract, are:\nform, striving, and fulfillment (see Roschitz 2016b, 177 ff.).\nRoschitz presents (Chapter 8) a summary and critical discussion of\nMally\u2019s Wirklichkeitsphilosophie. In particular, he discusses\nMally\u2019s concept of a magical experience and points out that Mally\u2019s\ndoes not provide a rational criterion for distinguishing those magical\nexperiences from pure superstition (see Roschitz 2016b, 164 ff.).\n\n\nSo far, some of these texts have been studied to find a better\nanswer to the question to what degree Mally\u2019s philosophy was influenced\nby National Socialism (Sagheb-Oehlinger 2008). Among the aforementioned\nlecture manuscripts we find the following: \u201cErnst Mally: Value\nTheory and Ethics\u201d. This is a lecture delivered by Mally at the\nUniversity of Graz, winter semester 1926/27, elaborated and typed by\nHans Mokre in 1927.\n",
