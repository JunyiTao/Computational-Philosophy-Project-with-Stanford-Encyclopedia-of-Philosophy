    "main_text": "Formal, Procedural and Substantive Requirements || Procedural Aspects\n5.2 Procedural Aspects\n\nWe should complement this list of formal characteristics with a list\nof procedural principles as well, which are equally indispensable to\nthe Rule of Law. We might say that no one should have any penalty,\nstigma or serious loss imposed upon them by government except as the\nupshot of procedures that involve (I have adapted this list from\nTashima 2008: 264):\n\n a hearing by an impartial and independent tribunal that is\nrequired to administer existing legal norms on the basis of the formal\npresentation of evidence and argument;\n a right to representation by counsel at such a hearing\n a right to be present, to confront and question witnesses, and to\nmake legal argument about the bearing of the evidence and the various\nlegal norms relevant to the case; and \n a right to hear reasons from the tribunal when it reaches its\ndecision, which are responsive to the evidence and arguments presented\nbefore it.\n\n\nArguably, such procedural principles matter more in the ordinary\nperson\u2019s conception of the Rule of Law than the formal criteria\nmentioned in the previous section. When people worried that the\nAmerican detention facility in Guantanamo Bay from 2003 to the present\nwas a \u201cblack hole\u201d so far as legality was concerned, it\nwas precisely the lack of these procedural rights that they were\nconcerned about. What the detainees demanded, in the name of the Rule\nof Law, was an opportunity to appear before a proper legal tribunal,\nto confront and answer the evidence against them (such as it was), and\nto be represented so that their own side of the story could be\nexplained. No doubt the integrity of these proceedings would depend in\npart on the formal characteristics of the legal norms that were\nsupposed to govern their detention, whose application in their case\nthey could call in question at the hearings that they demanded. It is\ndifficult to make a case at a hearing if the laws governing detention\nare kept secret or are indeterminate or are constantly changing. Even\nso, we still miss out on a whole important dimension of the Rule of\nLaw ideal if we do not also focus on the procedural demands themselves\nwhich, as it were, give the formal side of the Rule of Law this\npurchase. \n\nSome procedural requirements are also institutional in character:\nthere must be courts and there must be judges whose independence of\nthe other branches of government is guaranteed. This side of the Rule\nof Law is connected with the constitutional principle of the\nseparation of powers. That principle is sometimes justified simply on\nthe ground that it is unhealthy for power to be institutionally\nconcentrated in society. But it also has a Rule of Law justification\ninasmuch as it assigns distinct significance to distinct stages in the\nmaking and application of laws (Waldron 2013).\n",
