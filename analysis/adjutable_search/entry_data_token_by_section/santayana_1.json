Philosophy, Literature, and Culture\n\n\nThroughout his life, Santayana\u2019s literary achievements are evident.\nAs an eight-year-old Spaniard, he wrote Un matrimonio (A\nMarried Couple), describing the trip of a newly married couple that\nmeets the Queen of Spain. Later in Boston, he wrote a poetic parody of\nThe Aeneid; \u201cA Short History of the Class of\n\u201882\u201d; and \u201cLines on Leaving the Bedford\nSt. Schoolhouse.\u201d His first book, Sonnets and Other\nVerses (1894), is a book of poems, not philosophy. And, until the\nturn of the century, much of his intellectual life was directed to the\nwriting of verse and drama. He was a principal figure in making\nmodernism possible but was not a modernist in poetry or\nliterature. His naturalism and emphasis on constructive imagination\ninfluenced both T. S. Eliot and Wallace Stevens. Eliot\u2019s notion of the\n\u201cobjective correlative\u201d is drawn from Santayana, and\nStevens follows Santayana in his refined naturalism by incorporating\nboth Platonism and Christianity without any nostalgia for God or\ndogma.\n\n\nSantayana was among the leaders in transforming the American\nliterary canon, dislodging the dominant Longfellow, Lowell, Whittier,\nHolmes, Bryant canon. Santayana\u2019s essay \u201cThe Genteel Tradition in\nAmerican Philosophy\u201d (presented to the Philosophical Union of the\nUniversity of California in 1911) greatly affected Van Wyck Brooks\u2019s\nAmerica\u2019s Coming-of-Age, a book that set the tone for\nmodernism. Brooks drew on Santayana\u2019s essay, adapting Santayana\u2019s idea\nof two Americas to fit his notion of an America split between highbrow\nand lowbrow culture.\n By the turn of the century, Santayana\u2019s interests largely centered\non his philosophical inquiries, and although he never abandoned\nwriting poetry, he no longer considered it his central work. Even so,\nsome of his most moving poetry came later and was inspired by the\ntrench warfare and casualties of World War I: \u201cA Premonition:\nCambridge, October, 1913\u201d; \u201cThe Undergraduate Killed in\nBattle: Oxford, 1915\u201d; \u201cSonnet: Oxford, 1916\u201d; and\n\u201cThe Darkest Hour: Oxford, 1917.\u201d Throughout his life,\neven near death, he recited and translated long fragments of Horace,\nRacine, Leopardi, and others.\n\n\nThe relationships between literature, art, religion and philosophy\nare prominent themes throughout Santayana\u2019s writings. The Sense of\nBeauty (1896) is a primary source for the study of aesthetics.\nPhilip Blair Rice wrote in the foreword to the 1955 Modern Library\nedition: \u201cTo say that aesthetic theory in America reached\nmaturity with The Sense of Beauty is in no way an\noverstatement. Only John Dewey\u2019s Art as Experience has\ncompeted with it in the esteem of philosophical students of aesthetics\nand has approached its suggestiveness for artists, critics and the\npublic which takes a thoughtful interest in the arts.\u201d\nSantayana\u2019s groundbreaking approach to aesthetics is emphasized in\nArthur Danto\u2019s \u201cIntroduction\u201d to the 1988 critical edition.\nDanto writes that Santayana brings \u201cbeauty down to earth\u201d\nby treating it as a subject for science and giving it a central role in\nhuman conduct, in contrast to the preceding intellectualist tradition\nof aesthetics. \u201cThe exaltation of emotion and the naturalization\nof beauty \u2014 especially of beauty \u2014 imply a revolutionary\nimpulse for a book it takes a certain violent act of historical\nimagination to recover\u201d (Sense of Beauty, xxviii). This\nnaturalistic approach to aesthetics is expanded in his philosophical\nexplication of art found in The Life of Reason: Reason in Art\n(1905).\n\n\nIn 1900, Santayana\u2019s Interpretations of Poetry and Religion\ndevelops his view that religion and poetry are expressive celebrations\nof life. Each in its own right is of great value, but if either is\nmistaken for science, the art of life is lost along with the beauty of\npoetry and religion. Science provides explanations of natural\nphenomena, but poetry and religion are festive celebrations of human\nlife born of consciousness generated from the interaction of one\u2019s\npsyche (the natural structure and heritable traits of one\u2019s physical\nbody) and the physical environment. As expressions of human values,\npoetry and religion are identical in origin. Understanding the\nnaturalistic base for poetry and religion and valuing their expressive\ncharacter enable one to appreciate them without being hoodwinked:\n\u201cpoetry loses its frivolity and ceases to demoralise, while religion\nsurrenders its illusions and ceases to deceive\u201d (172). Interestingly,\nhis father expressed similar views in his letters to his son, providing\nthe genesis of his son\u2019s reflections, and this conclusion is expressed\nas late as the 1946 publication of The Idea of Christ in the\nGospels where Santayana presents the idea of Christ as poetic and\nimaginative, contrasted with attempts at historical, factual accounts\nof the Christ figure. The impact of Santayana\u2019s view was significant,\nand Henry James (after reading Interpretations of Poetry and\nReligion) wrote that he would \u201ccrawl across London\u201d if need be to\nmeet Santayana.\n\nThree Philosophical Poets (1910) was the first volume of\nthe Harvard Studies in Comparative Literature. Santayana employs a\nnaturalistic account of poetry and philosophy, attempting to combine\ncomparative structures with as few embedded parochial assumptions as\npossible while making explicit our material boundness to particular\nworlds and perspectives. His analyses of Lucretius, Dante, and Goethe\nare described by one biographer as \u201ca classical work and one of the few\nwritten in America to be genuinely comparative in conception and\nexecution, for its absence of national bias and its intellectual,\nlinguistic, and aesthetic range\u201d (McCormick, 193).\n\n\nInitially, Santayana appears optimistic about the youthful America.\nIn his Berkeley lecture, \u201cThe Genteel Tradition in American\nPhilosophy,\u201d he declared \u201cthe American Will inhabits the\nsky-scraper; the American Intellect inhabits the colonial\nmansion.\u201d (\u201cThe Genteel Tradition in American\nPhilosophy,\u201d Triton Edition, vol. VII. P. 129.) European\ntranscendentalism and Calvinism are the American intellectual\ntraditions, but they no longer suit the American drive for success in\nindustry, business, and football. Hence, the youthful willfulness of\nthe country has outrun the old wits, but there remains a chance for\nwisdom and energy to be coupled in a future coherent and rich\ntradition, and he sees the beginnings of such a tradition in James\u2019s\npragmatism.\n\n\nWithin a decade, he is less optimistic. Character and Opinion in\nthe United States (1920) is his valediction to America. It\nincludes frank, intellectual portraits of his Harvard colleagues and of\nAmerican culture. From his residence in Cambridge, he praises the\nEnglish emphasis on social cooperation and personal integrity and\ncontrasts them with America where \u201cYou must wave, you must cheer, you\nmust push with the irresistible crowd; otherwise you will feel like a\ntraitor, a soulless outcast, a deserted ship high and dry on the shore\n\u2026\u00a0. This national faith and morality are vague in idea, but\ninexorable in spirit; they are the gospel of work and the belief in\nprogress. By them, in a country where all men are free, every man finds\nthat what most matters has been settled beforehand\u201d (211).\n\n\nSantayana\u2019s standing as a literary figure reached its zenith with\nthe publication of The Last Puritan (1936). The Last\nPuritan is Santayana\u2019s only novel, and it was an international\nsuccess. It was compared positively with Goethe\u2019s Wilhelm\nMeister, Pater\u2019s Marius, and Mann\u2019s The Magic\nMountain. Its provenance lies in the 1890s when Santayana began a\nseries of sketches on college life that, broadened through his\nexperience and travel, resulted in The Last Puritan.\nEssentially, it is about the life and early death of an American youth,\nOliver Alden, who is sadly restricted by his Puritanism. Santayana\ndraws a sharp contrast with the European Mario, who delights in all\nmatters without a narrow moralism. Mario is a carefree, naturally\ngifted and likeable young man who by American standards appears too\nfocused on the peripheral aspects of life: travel, opera, love affairs,\nand architecture. And the American perspective is embodied in the\ntragic hero, Oliver Alden, who is the last Puritan. He does what is\nright, based on his duties to his family, school, and friends. Life is\na slow, powerful flow of tasks and responsibilities. He is intelligent\nand knows there is more than obligation, and he senses his guilt at not\nbeing able to achieve the natural abundant life, but knowing this only\nnourishes his Puritanism and causes him to feel guilty about being\nguilty. In a charming scene in the novel, Oliver introduces Mario to\nProfessor Santayana at Harvard. Oliver is a dedicated student and\nfootball player, thoroughly a first rate American taking matters\nseriously and doing his best. After only a short visit with the\nProfessor, Mario, it is decided by Santayana, does not need to take a\ncourse from the Professor. Mario already has the natural, instinctual\napproach of a cultivated person. Oliver, on the other hand, knows he\nmust work to achieve his goal, which will be only a succession of\ngoals, and ends tragically. Santayana\u2019s Hispanic and Catholic\nbackground play a central role in his critique of American life: too\nbound by past traditions and obligations that are not understood or\nrooted in one\u2019s own culture.\n\n\nThe fear that Santayana\u2019s autobiography would be lost or destroyed\nduring World War II, led Scribner\u2019s, the publisher, to conspire with\nthe U.S. Department of State, the Vatican, and the Spanish government\nto bring the manuscript of the first part (Persons and Places)\nout of Rome sub rosa, despite the Italian government\u2019s refusal\nto allow any mail to the U.S. The manuscript for the second part\n(The Middle Span, 1945) also was conveyed surreptitiously to\nNew York. The third part (My Host the World, 1953) was\npublished after Santayana\u2019s death. His autobiography provides the basis\nfor understanding the development of his philosophy\n",
