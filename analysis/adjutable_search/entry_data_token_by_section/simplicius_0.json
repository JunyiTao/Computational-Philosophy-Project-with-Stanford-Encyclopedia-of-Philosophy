    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nNot much is known about Simplicius\u2019 life. In Histories\nII, 30.1 [Keydell], Agathias informs us\nthat Simplicius was born in Cilicia (south coastal region of Asia\nMinor; today southern Turkey, north to northeast of the island\nCyprus). According to Simplicius\u2019 own commentaries, he was\neducated in Alexandria by Ammonius, son of Hermias (In Cael.\n271.19), and in Athens by Damascius (In Phys. 601.19). Hence,\nhe refers to Proclus as \u201cteacher of my teachers\u201d (In\nPhys. 611.11\u201312; 795.4\u20135) and \u201csuccessor of\nPlato (diadochos, i.e., head of the school) who lived shortly\nbefore me\u201d (In Cael. 640.24\u201325). The following\ntext from Simplicius\u2019 Commentary on the Physics\nillustrates well the important role that Proclus played in the\ntradition of Athenian Neoplatonism:\n\n\nAll the philosophers after Proclus and down to my time, more or less,\nfollowed Proclus not only on this detail, but in all the other dogmas,\nexcept for Asclepiodorus, Proclus\u2019 most gifted student, and our\nDamascius. The former because of his immense talent, took pleasure in\ninnovating in doctrinal matters, whereas Damascius, because of his\nlove of work and his sympathy for Iamblichus, was not afraid to\nreconsider many of Proclus\u2019 dogmas. (Simplicius, In\nPhys. 795.11\u201317, translated by I. Hadot and M. Chase, in I.\nHadot 2015: 126 n. 223\n\n\nSeveral passages in Simplicius\u2019 commentaries also testify to the\ncrucial role that Iamblichus\u2019 philosophy and exegesis played for\nhim (see\n \u00a71\n and\n \u00a75 in the supplement on \u201cThe Commentaries of Simplicius\u201d).\n Simplicius\u2019 controversy with the Christian commentator\nPhiloponus, who taught in Alexandria, regarding whether the world was\ncreated in time (see\n \u00a73 in the supplement on \u201cThe Commentaries of Simplicius\u201d) is well known. However, it seems that they never met personally\n(\u201c[I] feel no hostility against this man whom, to my knowledge,\nI have never seen\u201d; In Cael. 26.18\u201319, translated\nby C. Wildberg).\n\nIn 529, a year that some historians have considered the end of\nAntiquity, emperor Justinian ordered that \u201cno one was any longer\nallowed to teach philosophy and astronomy\u201d (this is often\nreferred to as the closure of the Platonic Academy; for details and\nfurther literature see Goulet & Coda 2016: 344). It is assumed\nthat this edict mainly targeted non-Christian philosophers such as\nNeoplatonists and Manichaeans. Following this prohibition, but not\nimmediately, Simplicius travelled with six other Neoplatonic\nphilosophers under the lead of Damascius to the court of the Persian\nKing Chosroes, who had only come to power in Ctesiphon in 531.\nDisappointed by their experience in Persia\u2014the historian\nAgathias suggests that the philosophers at first considered Chosroes a\nkind of ideal Platonic philosopher king\u2014and protected by a peace\ntreaty between Persia and Rome in 532, the philosophers left the\ncountry, apparently several months after their arrival. Where the\nseven went after that is still a matter of debate. The treaty says,\ninter alia, that \n\n\nthese men should be allowed to return to their own country and live\nthere henceforth in safety, without being forced to adopt opinions\nwhich they did not hold, or to change their own faith. (translated by\nA. Cameron 1969/1970: 169) \n\n\nDamascius recorded that he returned in 538 to his home country of\nSyria (Hoffmann 1994: 590\u2013591). Did the others follow him, or\ndid they return to Athens, Syria, or Harran (ancient Carrhae, in the\nnorth of Mesopotamia, close to the Syrian border)? This question has\nnot been satisfactorily answered (for the ongoing discussion, see\nGoulet & Coda 2016: 343\u2013346; Watts 2005: 290\u2013298).\nHowever, it seems clear that, in order to write his\ncommentaries\u2014which, as most scholars assume, were composed after\nreturning from Chosroes\u2019 court (I. Hadot 2014:\n135)\u2014Simplicius needed quite an extensive library. Therefore, he\ncould only have returned to a place that provided such a library.\n\nSimplicius wrote four commentaries that survive today (on\nEpictetus\u2019 Handbook and Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories, Physics, and De Caelo). It is\ndebatable whether, as univocally attested by the all manuscripts,\nSimplicius is also the author of a fifth commentary, on\nAristotle\u2019s De anima. Although there are several other\nworks that he might have written, these do not include any\ncommentaries on Plato aside from one work on the Phaedo\n(Goulet & Coda 2016: 361\u2013364, 390\u2013394; see In\nCael. 369.4\u20136 and In Epict. I, 350\u2013354\n[Hadot]). As is discussed in the supplement\n The Commentaries of Simplicius, it is\n difficult to determine the order and periods in which Simplicius\n composed his commentaries.\n\nAlthough there are no extant commentaries on Plato that are known to\ncome from Simplicius\u2019 hand, Simplicius\u2019 readers will\nnotice his intimate familiarity with and highest esteem for Plato.\nSimplicius\u2019 commentaries constitute a rich source for Platonic\nphilosophy, and he is well known for his tendency to harmonise Plato\nand Aristotle (see\n \u00a76).\n His work continues a tendency, probably initiated by Porphyry, to\nmake Plato\u2019s pupil an integral part of the Platonic tradition,\nreading Aristotle through Platonic\u2014or rather\nNeoplatonic\u2014lenses. Simplicius frequently chooses a Platonic\ndialogue in order to compare Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s\nphilosophy in a specific domain by way of contrast\u2014for example,\nwhen he comments on the Physics and the De Caelo,\nwhere the Timaeus is always at hand. The Sophist and\nhis the doctrine of the highest kinds (megista gen\u00ea)\nplay an important role in Simplicius\u2019 commentary on the\nCategories (cf. already in Plotinus VI 1\u20133\n[42\u201344]). It should also be noted that Iamblichus\u2019\nNeoplatonic psychology, which can be considered a systematisation of\nPlato\u2019s views, lies in the background throughout\nthe Commentary on the De anima. When Simplicius finds\nreferences to Eleatic philosophy in Aristotle (especially in\nPhysics I), the Sophist and Parmenides also\nfigure prominently.\n\nIt is also important to identify Simplicius\u2019 purpose and\nintended audience in writing his compendious exegetical works. Given\nthe sheer size of the commentaries and their argumentative structure,\nwhich at times is rather complex, it is difficult to imagine that\nSimplicius is aiming at students. Moreover, given the uneven length of\nthe exegeses of specific lemmata and the considerable number\nof so-called digressions (see\n \u00a72),\n it is not clear how a teacher could organise the material in the\ncommentaries for a series of lessons. To be suitable for the\nclassroom, Simplicius\u2019 style would have needed to be much more\ndidactic and elementary. Although Baltussen (2010: 717) maintains that\n\n\n\nSimplicius writes mostly for a student audience and that his works are\nintended to be read (In Cael. 377.32, 653.9; In\nPhys. 111.17, 762.29), \n\n\nthis seems unlikely. Rather, his underlying incentive seems to be to\npreserve as much original material (from Aristotle, his predecessors,\nand his commentators) as possible and to present it in a way that\nbrings the unity of the Hellenic tradition to the fore. This would\nexplain why Simplicius continuously reminds his readers not only of\nthe harmony (sumph\u00f4nia) between Plato and Aristotle,\nwith Aristotle as a loyal member of the Platonic tradition, but also\nthe continuity of Aristotle with the Presocratics, especially the\nPythagoreans and the Eleatics. There are several indications in\nSimplicius\u2019 collective text that he is addressing readers of\n\u201cconsiderable sophistication\u201d (Bowen 2013: 5) and that the\ntarget audience, as should be suspected given his use of the first\nperson plural, is \n\n\ncontemporary Platonists in some community (to which he did or did not\nbelong) or [\u2026] readers imagined to be of like mind in a\ncounterfactual present. (2013: 5) \n\n\nThis fully accords with the view that Simplicius probably did not\nteach in any school and that when he wrote his commentaries, there was\ntherefore no philosophical curriculum. As Golitsis (2018: 95) has\nconvincingly suggested, \n\n\n[T]here was no place where they [sc. the Platonic philosophers] could\nbe trained [\u2026]. Simplicius invites them to learn by themselves\nor, if possible, in groups. (see In Cat. 7.33\u20138.2)\n\n\nWhat makes Simplicius\u2019 commentaries a unique source for the\nhistory of philosophy before him is the fact that he preserved so much\nmaterial from his predecessors, often in verbatim quotations:\n\n\n[\u2026] Simplicius, clearly aware of the fact that the works of\nmany philosophers earlier, contemporary with, and later than Aristotle\nwere in danger of disappearing made a point of quoting from them at\nlength. And so he has often preserved for us texts and information not\nextant elsewhere. Suffice it to mention, by way of example, the\nfragments of Anaximander, Parmenides, Zeno, Melissus, Empedocles,\nAnaxagoras, Theophrastus (especially his History of\nPhilosophy or Physik\u00f4n Doxai), Eudemus (especially\nhis History of Geometry), Xenocrates, Epicurus, The Stoics,\nPorphyry, etc. It is noteworthy that in the case of the Presocratics\nSimplicius alone has preserved at least two thirds of all the verbatim\nquotations.
