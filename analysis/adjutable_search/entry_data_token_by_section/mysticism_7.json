As Chris Letheby puts it: \u201cNoetic\nquality refers to a strong sense of gaining a genuine and unmediated\ninsight, or of encountering ultimate reality; the mystical experience,\nby definition, is felt to be \u2018more real than real\u2019\u201d (Letheby 2021,\n25). To what extent this knowledge could come from the experiences\nalone will be discussed in Section 9.\n",
