    "main_text": "The Common Point of View\n8. The Common Point of View\n\n\nAs we saw, the moral sentiments are produced by sympathy with those\naffected by a trait or action. Such sympathetically-acquired feelings\nare distinct from our self-interested responses, and an individual of\ndiscernment learns to distinguish her moral sentiments (which are\ntriggered by contemplating another\u2019s character trait \u201cin\ngeneral\u201d) from the pleasure or uneasiness she may feel when\nresponding to a trait with reference to her \u201cparticular\ninterest,\u201d for example when another\u2019s strength of character makes\nhim a formidable opponent (T 3.1.2.4).\n\n\nHowever, the sympathetic transmission of sentiments can vary in\neffectiveness depending upon the degree of resemblance and contiguity\nbetween the observer and the person with whom he sympathizes. I\nreceive the sentiments of someone very much like me or very close to\nme in time or place far more strongly than I do those of someone\nunlike me or more remote from me in location or in history. Yet the\nmoral assessments we make do not vary depending upon whether the\nperson we evaluate resembles us in language, sex, or temperament, or\nis near or far. Indeed, our moral assessments of people remain stable\neven though our position with respect to them changes over time.\nFurthermore, sympathy only brings us people\u2019s actual sentiments or\nwhat we believe to be their actual sentiments; yet we feel moral\napproval of character traits that we know produce no real happiness\nfor anyone, because, for example, their possessor is isolated in a\nprison. To handle these objections to the sympathy theory, and to\nexplain more generally how, on a sentiment-based ethical theory, moral\nevaluations made by one individual at different times and many\nindividuals in a community tend to be fairly uniform, Hume claims that\npeople do not make their moral judgments from their own individual\npoints of view, but instead select \u201csome common point of view,\nfrom which they might survey their object, and which might cause it to\nappear the same to all of them\u201d (T 3.3.1.30). At least with\nrespect to natural virtues and vices, this common point of view is\ncomposed of the intimate perspectives of the various individuals who\nhave direct interactions with the person being evaluated. To make a\nmoral evaluation I must sympathize with each of these persons in their\ndealings with the subject of my evaluation; the blame or praise I give\nas a result of this imaginative exercise is my genuine moral\nassessment of the subject\u2019s character. In that assessment I also\noverlook the small external accidents of fortune that might render an\nindividual\u2019s trait ineffectual, and respond to traits that render a\ncharacter typically \u201cfitted to be beneficial to society,\u201d\neven if circumstances do not permit it to cause that benefit (T\n3.3.1.20). Thus I acquire by sympathy the pleasure or uneasiness that\nI imagine people\nwould feel were the trait able to operate as it ordinarily\ndoes. \u201cExperience soon teaches us this method of correcting our\nsentiments, or at least, of correcting our language, where the\nsentiments are more stubborn and inalterable\u201d (T 3.3.1.16).\n",
