    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n4. Metaphysics\n\n\nIn the preface to the Foundations, Du Ch\u00e2telet writes:\n\u201cIt is certain that there are a number of points in metaphysics\nwhich lend themselves to demonstrations just as rigorous as the\ndemonstrations of geometry, even if they are different in kind\u201d\n(Avant-propos, XII). Du Ch\u00e2telet's first\nepistemological principles thus help to establish what she takes to be\nthe certain truth of some metaphysical claims. At least two of these\nclaims, she believes, are necessarily true (see below for the kind of\nnecessity at work here). So, for example, and echoing Leibniz, because\nof the infinite divisibility of extension, and because atoms are\nextended, atoms cannot be the ultimate beings of nature; simple\nsubstances (or monads) must be such beings, and the PC establishes\nthis necessary (in Du Ch\u00e2telet's mind) metaphysical\nfact (IP \u00a7121). The argument for this runs as follows. Atoms,\ndefined as indivisible, extended particles of matter are\nactually divisible, and thus their very definition, taken\ntogether with the fact of their divisibility, implies a contradiction.\nSo atoms cannot be the necessary beings out of which matter is\ncomposed; indeed, they are by definition impossible. How does Du\nCh\u00e2telet justify the claim to atoms' divisibility? She justifies\nthis claim based upon the PC: \u2018there is no contradiction in the\ndivisibility of extended things,\u2019 and atoms are extended thing\n(IP \u00a7121). Notice here, she must be relying upon a conceptual\ndivisibility rather than a physical divisibility (for atoms are\ndefined as physically indivisible), though one could bolster\nthis argument by claiming that if an atom is conceptually divisible by\nus, then it is physically divisible by an omnipotence God, and\ntherefore is in neither way indivisible. Indeed, the divisibility of\nanything\u2014atoms or something else\u2014that is extended\nindicates that extension is composed and not simple; it is\ncomposed out of the parts into which it can be divided (IP\n\u00a7120). So nothing extended\u2014neither atoms nor any other\npiece of extension\u2014can serve as the simple beings out of which\ncomposed beings are made. Only things that are unextended can serve as\nthose simple beings (IP \u00a7122). Since this conclusion follows from\nthe PC, it is a conclusion about the necessary constitution\nof the simple beings of our universe.\n\n\nThis introduces a further feature of Du Ch\u00e2telet's PC in\naddition to those identified above. The PC, in the case of simple\nbeings, establishes both the necessary existence and\nnature of simple beings. That is, simple beings are\nnecessarily unextended (their nature), and they necessarily must exist\nso as to explain the fact of existing composed, extended\nbeings\u2014a fact established by our experience that such composed\nbeings do indeed exist. But this is what we might call a\nhypothetical necessity (as opposed to what we might call an\nabsolute necessity). That is, these necessary facts about the\nsimple beings of our world obtain only on the hypothesis that our\nworld actually does exist. God could have not created our world, and\nhad he so chosen to not create any world, then simple beings which\nactually exist (with the nature of being unextended) need not have\nexisted at all.\n\n\nThis discussion of Du Ch\u00e2telet's understanding of the (hypothetically) \nnecessary metaphysical constitution of the world further underscores a\npoint about her first principles of knowledge mentioned above. While\nthe fundamental metaphysical truth that only unextended beings can\nserve as the simple beings of the created world\u2014simple beings\nout of which complex beings are made\u2014may be repugnant to sense\nand imagination, reason (as captured by her PC in this case) demands we\nbelieve it (IP \u00a7135). But this indicates that Du \nCh\u00e2telet\u2014like Wolff\u2014may start with a psychological conception of\nthe PC, but (again like Wolff), she takes this psychological conception\nof the principle to indicate that there are underlying logical and\nontological truths which are the source of our psychological response\nto contradictions. So one of Du Ch\u00e2telet's first\nprinciples, in this case, gives us knowledge of metaphysical essences.\nImportantly, Du Ch\u00e2telet takes her conclusion that substances\nmust be simple in the way just characterized to be necessarily\ntrue on the hypothesis that God chooses to actualize our world.\n\n\nMoreover, she even uses her PSR to establish other claims about\nmaterial substance, claims that she also takes to be necessary in the\nsame sense of necessity that applies to simple beings (i.e. what we\nmay call \"hypothetical necessity\" above). In using the PSR, we observe the\nphenomenal facts of our actual world, and we can then posit hypotheses\nabout what must further be true of substance in order to make those\nfacts \n possible.[11]\n We see this method at work in several\nsections of the Institutions; for example, monads are active,\nshe concludes, because this would explain the brute fact of motion in\nthe phenomenal world, and she goes so far as to claim that force is\nalso necessary to the nature of matter (IP \u00a7139). At the same\ntime, precisely because things do not always move in the natural\nworld, this force must be of two kinds: active force\u2014the source\nof motion\u2014and passive force, or inertia\u2014the source of rest\n(IP \u00a7142). From her letter to Maupertuis of 30 April 1738 (#122),\nwe know that she was familiar with Leibniz's work on dynamics and\nmetaphysics, having sought out his articles on the\ntopics\u2014articles such as \u201cThe Brief Demonstration of the\nError of Descartes\u201d and \u201cA Specimen of Dynamics\u201d. So\nagain, phenomena of our actual world that Leibniz details in those\npapers lead Du Ch\u00e2telet to the same conclusions regarding the\nmetaphysics of substance that Leibniz reaches\u2014namely, that the\nunextended simple substances are also internally active, as well as\nconstrained in their activity, through their possession of active and\npassive force, as this claim helps explain the phenomena of the\nnatural\n world.[12]\n\n\nPrecisely because the elements of matter are simple, unextended active\nmonads, what we see around us as extended must be merely phenomenal,\nand she does endorse this \n Leibnizian-Wolffian[13]\nconclusion.\nThroughout her seventh chapter \u201cOn the Elements of Body\u201d,\nshe follows the Leibnizian tradition in concluding that metaphysical\nreality must consist in unextended monads. Consequently, what we see\nin nature as extended must be mere phenomena and not real in the\nfullest metaphysical sense. She concludes, for example, that\nphenomena, known best through sense, result from the confusion of\nsimple beings (IP \u00a7152\u20135), and that just as monads are\ncharacterized by active and passive force (now termed primitive\nforce), so too are phenomenal bodies to be thought of as possessing\nforce\u2014both derivative active and passive force (IP\n\u00a7158\u20139). Thus, suppositions such as Newton's that the\nnatural world can be described with reference to inelastic, invisible,\nextended atoms must be suppositions not about ground floor metaphysics\nbut about the derivative physical world which is merely\nphenomenal in a broadly Leibnizian sense. This has led Linda\nJanik to helpfully characterize Du Ch\u00e2telet's account of the\ncreated world as a three-tier account (Janik 1982, 106): the basic\nmetaphysical tier of unextended monads, the subvisible physical tier\nof (for Du Ch\u00e2telet) extended matter which is also imbued with\nderivative force, and the visible physical tier of bodies in motion\nand at rest. Without working through the details of her picture,\nincluding the coherence or difficulties with it, what this three-tier\naccount permits is significant separation between metaphysics and\nphysics. We see this when we consider the following. We can know\nthat there is a systematic interconnection among all elements\nof the created world\u2014the PSR, together with what we can derive\nof God's nature seem to establish this for Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2014we\ncannot always know all the details of that systematicity. Moreover, we\ncan expect that this systematicity occurs most fundamentally at the\nlevel of ground floor metaphysics\u2014that is, among unextended\nmonads. But Du Ch\u00e2telet does not spell out in detail how exactly\nthe metaphysical tier and physical tiers are related to each other\n(Iltis 1977, 36\u20137). And so, while the systematic\ninterconnectedness we experience at the level of phenomena\u2014the\nrealm of physics, that is\u2014surely has some grounding in\nmetaphysics, crucially, we cannot know many details of the connection\namong realms. While it is certainly true that there is some connection\nbetween the metaphysics and physics\u2014for example, the force,\nwhich belongs to monads explains the brute phenomena of motion and\nrest in the physical world\u2014physics does enjoy significant\nautonomy from metaphysics (Janik 1982, 106; Barber 1967, \n 209).[14] \nWe see the impact of\nthis on her physics in \u00a76 below.\n",
