    "main_text": "Matters of Definition\n1. Matters of Definition\n\nThe Japanese word kokugaku has been variously translated into\nEnglish and this makes simple definition difficult. English terms like\n\u2018Japan Studies\u2019, \u2018National Learning/Studies\u2019,\n\u2018nativism\u2019 and \u2018essentialism\u2019 all have their\nadvocates.  One approach is to think of kokugaku as having\nbroad and narrow meanings. Scholarship of all sorts expanded\ndramatically in Japan during the seventeenth century spurred on by\nrelative tranquility, and increasing levels of prosperity and\nliteracy. Alongside the more traditional studies of China, there arose\nnew historical studies of things Japanese\u2014history, literature,\nphilology, poetics, customs, mythology, the tradition of kami\nworship and so on. Collectively those forms of Japanese studies can be\nthought of as kokugaku in the broad sense. \n\nMore narrowly, some of these studies in the eighteenth century came to\nfocus on Japanese distinctiveness principally vis a vis China, which\nwas now posited as an Other whose historical influence on Japan was\nconstrued as harmful. In the nineteenth century the frame of reference\nexpanded to include Europe and the world as a whole. This nativist\nessentialism was also sometimes called kokugaku, and it came\nto be the crucible in which Japanese identity was forged. One\ninterpretation was that to be Japanese was to partake in an intuitive\nconformity with the rhythms of nature, and to possess an untutored\nheart-mind that fostered the ancient arcadia. Yet another\ninterpretation was that the Japanese people were descended from and as\nvaried as the innumerable kami, some good and some bad, but\nunmistakably blessed when taken as a whole. \n\nStrictly speaking, Kokugaku during the Tokugawa period\n(1600\u20131868) was neither a movement nor a school but rather a\nsuccession of schools\u2014private academies\u2014that had their own\ndistinctive orientations and specialties, and in the analysis that\nfollows we will begin by following the lead of Japanese scholarship by\nseeing the essence of Kokugaku in the writings of its Tokugawa-era\nparagons: Keich\u016b, Azumamaro, Mabuchi, Norinaga, and Atsutane.\n\n\nAfter the Meiji Restoration of 1868 Kokugaku became an ideologically\ncharged academic field that was harnessed to create empire and\nimperial subjects at home and abroad. It also spawned related\nenquiries into folklore and ethnography. Following Japan\u2019s\nmilitary defeat and during the Allied Occupation 1945\u201352, aside\nfrom a handful of places such as Kokugaku-in University, Kokugaku was\nstripped of its imperial and spiritual coloring, leaving behind\nsterilized notions of what was asserted to be uniquely Japanese about\nJapan and its people. From roughly the 1980s these came to be grouped\nunder the rubric Nihonjinron or theories of Japaneseness,\nreintroducing a spiritual component that can be seen in the animism\ncharacteristic of much anime and \u201csoft power\u201d\ndiplomacy. As a result, the word kokugaku is no longer used\nin contemporary discourse to refer to present-day nativist or\nessentialist scholarship. \n",
