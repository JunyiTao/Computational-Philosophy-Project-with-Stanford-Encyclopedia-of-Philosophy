    "main_text": "Objections || Rawls\n5.1 Rawls\n\nIn A Theory of Justice, Rawls assures his readers that his\ntheory would not produce a meritocratic society. That is not to say\nthat there is no common ground between Rawls and meritocrats. Both\nagree that equal opportunity is an essential element of a just\n society.[7]\n But Rawls pairs equal opportunity not with a meritocratic\ndistributive rule, but with his Difference Principle. A just\nsociety, according to Rawls, will respond to merit only insofar as\nthat benefits the worst-off members of society. Conceivably, by\nallowing meritorious citizens to earn more than non-meritorious\ncitizens, we can grow the social pie and thereby enable greater\nredistribution to the worst-off. If that is the case, and only if that\nis the case, will Rawls\u2019 theory pay any heed to merit. But\nmerit\u2019s role in Rawlsian distribution will always be mild,\ninstrumental, and contingent.\n\nRawls has four other objections to meritocracy. The first targets\ndesert-based theories of justice broadly. Rawls claims that no one\ndeserves anything because all bases for desert originate in\n\u201cfortunate family or social circumstances\u201d. A person is\nintelligent, for instance, either because she has a naturally high IQ\nor because she was raised in an environment that cultivated that\ntrait. Either way, that kind of \u201cfortune\u201d undermines\ndesert-based distribution. (Marx makes a similar argument in\n\u201cCritique of the Gotha Program\u201d.)\n\nSecond, Rawls regards meritocracy as unworkable. It may just be\npractically impossible to track people\u2019s merits in sufficient\ndetail to enable merit-based distribution.\n\nThird, perhaps meritocracy is only justified by \u201ccomprehensive\ndoctrines\u201d, and does not emerge from free and equal people in a\nsystem of cooperation (Rawls 1993). If that is so (and if Rawlsian\npublic reason is sound), then that is a problem. But Margaret Holmgren\n(1986) and James Sterba (1974) argue that Rawlsian contractors would\nin fact choose a desert-based system of justice, like meritocracy.\n\nFourth, Rawls says that meritocracy is insufficiently democratic. This\nis interesting because later in A Theory of Justice he\nsuggests an openness to meritocratic governance:\n\n\nNow the ship of state is in some ways analogous to a ship at sea; and\nto the extent that this is so, the political liberties are indeed\nsubordinate to the other freedoms that, so to say, define the\nintrinsic good of the passengers. Admitting these assumptions, plural\nvoting may be perfectly just. (1971: 233)\n\n",
