    "main_text": "The essence of the soul and life after death\n6. The essence of the soul and life after death\n\n\nCrescas devotes an important portion of the sixth part of the second\nessay to the question of the soul\u2019s\n essence.[29]\nThe general subject of this part is the goal of\nthe Torah, which is for Crescas also the goal of humanity and of the\nentire world. In this discussion, Crescas speaks of the different goals\nthat the Torah fulfills. The Torah helps people to fulfill their\ndifferent worldly goals, such as their relation to themselves (health,\nmorality, etc.), to their family, and to their country. In this part of\nthe essay, Crescas\u2019s explanation is close to Maimonides\u2019\nrational explanation of the divine commandments. But the Torah also\nhelps humans to get a spiritual reward in the hereafter. On the subject\nof the essence of the soul along with reward and punishment after\ndeath, Crescas builds a philosophical critique of the\nMaimonidean-Aristotelian opinion and proposes instead a more\ntraditional view.\n\n\nRegarding the topic of soul\u2019s essence, Crescas holds a\nplatonic opinion: The soul naturally continues its life after its\nseparation from the body. The reason for this immortality of the soul\nis that the soul is a spiritual substance with a potential for\nknowledge. As a spiritual substance, the soul has no opponent between\nits different parts and any causes of loss. In his proofs that this\ndefinition of the soul is right, Crescas critiques the different\nopinions of Aristotelianism. The main stream of the medieval Arab\nAristotelian opinion on this topic (apart from Ibn Sina) is that only\nhuman knowledge can survive the death of the body. But there are very\ndifferent opinions in the Aristotelian school about this subject. An\nexample of this divergence is the opinion of Gersonides, who\nunderstands that the knowledge of immaterial law accords the\npossibility of life after death for the individual. In spite of\nthis, Averroes (as Crescas understand his view) claims that no\nindividual immortal existence is possible after death (all the\nknowledge of all people returns to its source in the active intellect).\nIn his critique of the Aristotelian opinions, Crescas uses the\ndifferent\n arguments[30]\nthat\ndiverse Aristotelians attack each other with to ultimately refute all\nAristotelian opinions.\n\n\nCrescas tries to prove that the soul and not the mind holds the\npotential for knowledge. After this step he argues that the true goal\nof the soul is not rational knowledge but the love of God. In this\nargumentation, Crescas criticizes the opinion of Maimonides that love\nof God is a function of knowledge. According to Crescas, love is\nrelated to the will, which itself is the concordance of the appetitive\nand imaginative parts of the soul and is not related to the mind\n(itself an Aristotelian doctrine of animal volition, as mentioned\nabove). Moreover, the true essence and the true goal of the soul is not\nto acquire knowledge but to delight in loving God. This opinion goes\ntogether with the view that the principal attribute and motive of God\nis not intellectual knowledge but love.\n\n\nAccording to Crescas, the easiest way to express love for God is to\nfulfill obligations to him and to do what He commands. It is the reason\nwhy the Torah and particularly the commandments that are integral to it\nare the best way to attain spiritual reward after death. The Torah\ngives the easiest way to achieve our spiritual goals. After the\nseparation of the soul from the body, the soul stands by it and\nnaturally wants to express its true essence (loving God). If the soul\nloves God in this world, it becomes joyous and can now love him more\n(because the temptations of the body don\u2019t distract it). This\nrapture is the reward of the just in the hereafter. But if a person\ndoes not fulfill the love of God in this world, the soul becomes\ndespondent at his or her rebellion against God in the corporeal world,\nan error that it plainly understands after the death of the body. This\nprofound sadness is equivalent to the fire of hell.\n\n\nIn his critique of the Aristotelian position on these subjects,\nCrescas tries to construct a philosophical defense of what he considers\nto be the traditional Jewish view. He first tries to prove that the\nopinions of the Aristotelians are philosophically mistaken, and then\ngoes on to argue that what he considers to be the traditional view is\nphilosophically true. This critique of the Jewish Aristotelian opinion\nis one of Crescas\u2019s more important . In the Jewish orthodox\ncommunity, fulfillment of the commandments is the most important aspect\nof religious life. In the opinion of Maimonides, the majority of the\ncommandments (and all of the practical commandments) are only\nintermediaries to achieving philosophical knowledge, which is the\nsupreme goal of human endeavor. This opinion is one of the more\nproblematic aspects of Maimonides from a traditional point of view.\nThrough his critique of the Aristotelian view, Crescas builds a defense\nof what he considers to be the traditional view of the commandments as\nthe way to achieve the highest religious and spiritual goals.\n",
