    "main_text": "Reports on Pyrrho\u2019s Demeanor and Lifestyle\n5. Reports on Pyrrho\u2019s Demeanor and Lifestyle\n\nMost of the remaining evidence about Pyrrho has to do with his\npractical attitudes and behavior. There are a number of biographical\nanecdotes, and there are a few fragments of Timon that purport to\ndepict Pyrrho\u2019s state of mind. Some of the biographical\nanecdotes are clearly polemical inventions. For example, Diogenes\n(9.62) reports Antigonus as saying that Pyrrho\u2019s lack of trust\nin his senses led him to ignore precipices, oncoming wagons and\ndangerous dogs, and that his friends had to follow him around to\nprotect him from these various everyday hazards. But he then reports\nthe dissenting verdict of Aenesidemus, according to which Pyrrho was\nperfectly capable of conducting himself in a sensible manner. This\nreflects a longstanding ancient dispute as to whether it is possible\nto live if one radically abandons common-sense attitudes to the world.\nAntigonus has transformed a hostile criticism of Pyrrho\u2014that, if\none really were to adopt the attitudes he recommends, one\nwould be unable consistently to live as a sane human being\n\u2014 into an account of how Pyrrho actually did act; but there is\nno reason to take this seriously as biography. (It does, however,\nraise the question of what it means to mistrust the senses\u2014as\nthe Aristocles passage tells us that either Timon or Pyrrho\ndid\u2014if this is to be consistent with self-preservation in\none\u2019s ordinary behavior; we shall return to this point at the\nend of this section.)\n\nBut there are many other anecdotes, preserved in Diogenes and\nelsewhere, that cannot be dismissed in this fashion. The dominant\nimpression they convey as a group is of an extraordinary impassivity\nor imperturbability; with rare exceptions (which he himself is\nportrayed as regretting), Pyrrho is depicted as maintaining his calm\nand untroubled attitude no matter what happens to him. (The exceptions\nhave led Pyrrho\u2019s outlook to be labeled\n\u201caspirationalism\u201d; see Ribeiro (2022). But while his\nattainment of tranquility was admittedly not perfect, the picture we\nget is of someone who was truly exceptional in this respect.) This\nextends even to extreme physical pain\u2014he is reported not to have\nflinched when subjected to the horrific techniques of ancient\nsurgery\u2014but it also encompasses dangers such as being on a ship\nin a storm. (This is not to say that he did not avoid such troubles if\nhe could, as suggested by the apocryphal stories mentioned in the\nprevious paragraph; it is just to say that he did not lose his\ncomposure in the face of life\u2019s inevitable hardships.) There is\nanother aspect to this untroubled attitude as well. In numerous\nanecdotes Pyrrho is shown as unconcerned with adhering to the normal\nconventions of society; he wanders off for days on end by himself, and\nhe performs tasks that would normally be left to social inferiors,\nsuch as housework and even washing a pig. Here, too, the suggestion is\nthat he does not care about things that ordinary people do care about\n\u2014 in this case, the disapproval of others. (The passage from\nDiogenes quoted in the previous section, according to which Pyrrho\nheld \u201cthat human beings do everything by convention and\nhabit\u201d is not necessarily in conflict with this; by \u2018human\nbeings\u2019 Pyrrho might have meant ordinary human beings,\namong whom he would not have included himself.)\n\nThe fragments of Timon also emphasize Pyrrho\u2019s exceptional\ntranquility, and add a further, more philosophical dimension to it.\nSeveral fragments suggest that this tranquility results from his not\nengaging in theoretical inquiry like other philosophers, and with his\nnot engaging in debate with those philosophers. Other thinkers are\nperturbed by their need to discover how the universe works, and their\nneed to prevail in arguments with their rivals; Pyrrho is unconcerned\nabout any of this.\n\nClearly it would be foolish to accept every detail of this composite\naccount. Timon\u2019s picture is no doubt idealized, and the\nbiographical material surely includes a measure of embellishment.\nCollectively, however, these fragments and anecdotes add up to a\nhighly consistent portrait; it does not seem overconfident to take\nthis at least as reflecting an ideal towards which Pyrrho strived, and\nwhich he achieved to a sufficient degree to have attracted notice.\n\nWhat connections can be drawn between this portrait of Pyrrho\u2019s\ndemeanor and the philosophy expounded in the Aristocles passage? What\nwe have here, plainly, is a fuller specification of the\nataraxia that the Aristocles passage promised as the outcome\nof the process of responding in the recommended way to the three\nquestions. (And it confirms that, even if the process of reaching\nataraxia, as explained in the Aristocles passage, was largely\nTimon\u2019s rather than Pyrrho\u2019s, the ideal of\nataraxia itself was one to which Pyrrho adhered.) But\nwhy should thinking as Pyrrho did, according to that passage,\nyield ataraxia, and why should this outcome take the specific\nform suggested by the material discussed in this section?  Now is a\nconvenient point to address these questions (as we did not do in\ninitially examining the Aristocles passage). We may distinguish the\noverall emotional tranquility depicted in the biographical material\nand the particular tranquility, derived from the avoidance of\ntheoretical inquiry, that is emphasized in the fragments of Timon.\n\nThe most obvious explanation for the overall emotional tranquility\nwould seem to be along the following lines. If one adopts the position\nrecommended in the Aristocles passage, one will not hold any\ndefinite beliefs, about any object or state of affairs, to the effect\nthat the object or state of affairs really is good, or valuable, or\nworth seeking\u2014or, on the other hand, bad or to be avoided. (This\nwill be true on either the metaphysical or the epistemological\ninterpretations of the Aristocles passage, and it will be true of\nPyrrho, given his answer to the first question, even if the rest is\nTimon\u2019s development.) Hence one will attach far less importance to the\nattainment or the avoidance of any particular objects, or the\noccurrence or non-occurrence of any particular state of affairs, than\none would if one thought that these things really did have some kind\nof positive or negative value; nothing will matter to one to anything\nlike the same extent as it matters to most people. If this is on the\nright lines, then Pyrrho\u2019s route to ataraxia closely\nresembles the one described in several places by Sextus Empiricus\n(PH 1.25\u201330, 3.235\u20138, M\n11.110\u201367); the account I have given is in fact modeled after\nSextus\u2019 explanation of how suspension of judgement produces\nataraxia. Indeed, it is difficult to see how else the process\nis to be reconstructed. One difference, however, between the practical\nattitudes of Pyrrho and Sextus is that Sextus attributes an important\nrole to convention in the shaping of one\u2019s behavior; more on\nthis in a moment.\n\nAs for the avoidance of theoretical inquiry and debate, if Pyrrho was\nprimarily a moralist and the Aristocles passage mostly contains\nTimon\u2019s ideas, such inquiry and debate would simply have been\noutside Pyrrho\u2019s sphere of interest. But if the Aristocles\npassage as a whole represents Pyrrho\u2019s own thought, it is fair\nto assume that he will have regarded such inquiry and debate as\ntroublesome because it is necessarily fruitless and interminable. If\nthe real nature of things is indeterminable by us, as the\nepistemological interpretation would have it, then to attempt to\ndetermine the nature of things, and to provide cogent grounds for the\nsuperiority of one\u2019s own theories, is to attempt the impossible;\nsuch matters are simply beyond our grasp. But if, as the metaphysical\ninterpretation would have it, the world is in its real nature\nindefinite, then one is also attempting the impossible, though for a\ndifferent reason; one is attempting to determine a fixed character for\nthings that inherently lack any fixed character. Of course, the thesis\nthat reality is indefinite is itself a definite statement. But it\nfollows from this statement that any attempt to establish fixed and\ndefinite characteristics for specific items in the universe is doomed\nto failure. And it seems to be this kind of theoretical inquiry that\nTimon represents Pyrrho as eschewing; as one fragment puts it\n(addressing Pyrrho), \u201cyou were not concerned to inquire what\nwinds hold sway over Greece, from where everything comes and into what\nit passes\u201d (Diogenes Laertius 9.65). On this reading, then,\nPyrrho\u2019s avoidance of inquiry and debate resembles the disdain\nfor physical speculation that is apparent in some writings of Plato\n(Phaedo for example); physical speculation is fruitless\nbecause the physical world is not susceptible to rational inquiry.\n\nHere another difference may be discerned from the Pyrrhonism of Sextus\nEmpiricus. For although Sextus certainly does not claim to have\ndefinite answers of his own concerning the nature of things, he has no\nqualms about engaging with his opponents in debate, or about pitting\nthem against one another. Indeed, the Pyrrhonism of Sextus depends on\na constant interplay of competing arguments on as many topics as\npossible. One\u2019s suspension of judgement results from one\u2019s\nexperience of the \u2018equal strength\u2019 (isostheneia)\nof the competing considerations on all sides of a given issue; but\nthis requires that one be regularly exposed to such competing\nconsiderations, and the works of Sextus are themselves bountiful\nsources for this. Sextus may agree with Pyrrho that such debates are\ninterminable, but they have an important role in later Pyrrhonist\npractice nonetheless. Pyrrho\u2019s own practice is quite different,\nbecause his ataraxia flows not from an ongoing practice of\nintellectual juggling, but from a conclusion about the nature\nof things, as reported in the Aristocles passage. As we have seen,\nthis conclusion may be interpreted in several different ways, but\nhowever we interpret it, it is a firm view of his.\n\nWe have seen that Pyrrho was unconcerned, or aspired to be\nunconcerned, about things that most of us care about very deeply. But\nhow does one make any decisions at all, if one adopts this kind of\nattitude? Unless we are to believe the stories of Pyrrho as a madman\ndepending on his friends to rescue him from precipices and dogs, we\nare entitled to expect an answer to this question. There is some\nevidence to suggest that the answer proposed\u2014if not by Pyrrho\nhimself, then at least by Timon\u2014was that one relies on the\nappearances. If this is correct, we have another link, at least at a\ngeneral level, with the Pyrrhonism of Sextus, for whom appearances are\nwhat he calls the \u201ccriterion of action\u201d. One difference,\nas mentioned earlier, is that Sextus lists laws and customs as one of\nthe four main varieties of appearances that one may use to guide\none\u2019s behavior; on Sextus\u2019 account, then, certain courses\nof action will appear to one as desirable or undesirable given that\nthey are approved or disapproved of by the prevailing mores. But\nPyrrho seems to have been thoroughly unconventional in some aspects of\nhis behavior. It is impossible to say specifically what kinds of\nphenomena were included for him and Timon under the heading of\n\u2018the appearances\u2019 \u2014 or whether they had anything\nvery precise in mind here. Nevertheless, it looks as if the early or\nproto-Pyrrhonist answer to the question of how one acts and makes\ndecisions is that one does so in light of the way things appear to\none. Depending on how we read the Aristocles passage, this might\namount to \u201cin light of the characteristics that things seem to\nhave (but, for all we know, may not really have)\u201d, or it\nmight amount to \u201cin light of the temporary and contingent\ncharacteristics that things manifest on any given occasion (but that\nare no part of how they really are, since how they really are\nis indefinite)\u201d. In either case, the way in which one mistrusts\nsensations and common-sense opinions, as the Aristocles passage\nrecommends, is not that one pays no attention to them in one\u2019s\neveryday behavior; one mistrusts them simply in that one does not take\nthem as a guide to the underlying nature of things.\n",
