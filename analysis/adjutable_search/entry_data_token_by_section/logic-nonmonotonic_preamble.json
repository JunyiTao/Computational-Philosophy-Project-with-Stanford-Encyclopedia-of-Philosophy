    "main_text": "\n\nThe term \u201cnon-monotonic logic\u201d (in short, NML) covers a\nfamily of formal frameworks devised to capture and represent\ndefeasible inference. Reasoners draw conclusions defeasibly\nwhen they reserve the right to retract them in the light of further\ninformation. Examples are numerous, reaching from inductive\ngeneralizations to reasoning to the best explanation to inferences on\nthe basis of expert opinion, etc. We find defeasible inferences in\neveryday reasoning, in expert reasoning (e.g. medical diagnosis), and\nin scientific reasoning. \n\nDefeasible reasoning\n just like deductive reasoning, can follow complex patterns. However,\nsuch patterns are beyond reach for classical logic (CL),\nintuitionistic logic (IL) or other logics that characterize deductive\nreasoning since they\u2014by their very nature\u2014do not allow for\na retraction of inferences. The challenge tackled in the domain of\nNMLs is to provide for defeasible reasoning forms what CL or IL\nprovide for mathematical reasoning: namely a formally precise\naccount that is materially adequate, where material adequacy\nconcerns the question of how broad a range of examples is captured by\nthe framework, and the extent to which the framework can do justice to\nour intuitions on the subject (at least the most entrenched ones).\n\n",
