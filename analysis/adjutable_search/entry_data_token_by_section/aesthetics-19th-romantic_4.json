    "main_text": "Aesthetics, Epistemology and Metaphysics || The Absolute\n3.1 The Absolute\n\nMost broadly, by the \u201cAbsolute\u201d, the romantics refer to\nthe unconditioned totality of all conditions. While the absolute\nitself is conditioned by nothing, it conditions all the finite\nphysical and mental manifestations of the world. Inspired by\nKant\u2019s discussion of omnitudo\nrealitatis\u2014\u201cAll of Reality\u201d\u2014and by\nSpinoza\u2019s all encompassing \u201csubstance\u201d, the romantic\nAbsolute is a whole, rather than an aggregate, that encompasses\neverything else, physical and mental: \u201cOnly the whole is\nabsolute\u201d (Novalis, AB: #454); \u201cThe universe is the\nabsolute subject, or the totality of all predicates\u201d (AB: #633).\nMetaphysically, every finite thing is merely one manifestation of an\nunconditional totality: only a single perspective on the whole. It is\nthus ultimately finite but also infinite, as part and parcel of the\ninfinite whole.\n\nThis notion of the Absolute is not distinctively romantic. The German\nIdealists, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, were also concerned with\nrelated conceptions of the Absolute. But the romantic treatment of the\nAbsolute is distinctively different from the idealistic one. And it is\nthe distinctive romantic treatment of the Absolute that\nexplains much in romantic aesthetics: While the idealists took the\nAbsolute to be transparent to the human mind, conceptually\nrepresentable, and inferentially related to other items of knowledge,\nthe romantics regarded it as (1) ungraspable by concepts (i.e., as\n\u201cnon-discursive\u201d) and (2) as non-foundational.\n\nFollowing Kant, the romantics believed that all knowledge is\ndiscursive: knowing requires conceptualization. But since concepts\ncondition everything that might be known by determining it to be one\nway or another according to the forms of discursive thought, the\nAbsolute, by its very definition as unconditioned, cannot be known.\n\n\n\nKnowledge [Erkennen] already denotes conditioned knowledge.\nThe unknowability of the absolute is, therefore, an identical\ntriviality. (F. Schlegel, KA 18: 511, #64)\n\n\nThe romantics further argued that the attempt to ground the whole\nedifice of knowledge in the Absolute\u2014familiar to them from\nFichte\u2019s project, which they both admired and harshly\ncriticized\u2014is futile. Like Kant, they believed that\nreason\u2019s natural and necessary drive to proceed towards the\nunconditioned can never be fully realized. The unconditioned totality\nof experience is \u201ca regulative idea\u201d (Novalis,\nFS: #472): it cannot serve as a systematic grounding of experience. As\nNovalis memorably puts it: \n\n\nWe seek the unconditioned [Das Ubedingte] and always find\nonly [conditioned] things [Dinge].\n(Bl\u00fcthenstaub, NS 2: 413, #1)\n\n\nSkeptical as they were about the discursive accessibility of the\nAbsolute and about its capacity to ground all knowledge, the romantics\nnever questioned either its existence or the worth of (open-endedly)\nstriving after it:\n\n\nNeither our knowledge nor our action can ever attain the point at\nwhich\u2026. All is one; the determinate line can be united with the\nindeterminate only through an infinite approximation [in\nunendlicher Ann\u00e4herung] (H\u00f6lderlin, \u201cHyperion\u201d, HSA 3:\n326).\n\n\nTherefore, philosophy, whose first theorem is \u201cAll is One and\nOne is All\u201d (F. Schlegel, ITP: 244), must be \u201ca\nstriving\u201d (ITP: 244). Even though philosophy cannot\nsystematically deduce all knowledge from the Absolute, it must\nnonetheless pursue its approximation. But if not through concepts, how\ncan one approximate the Absolute?\n\nThis is where aesthetics comes into the picture. Although scholars of\nromanticism disagree about the exact nature of the romantic\napproximation of the\n Absolute,[4]\n they widely agree that it includes a variety of feelings associated\nwith the aesthetic, like aesthetic pleasure, poetic feeling,\n\u201clonging for the infinite [Sehnsucht nach dem\nUnendlichen]\u201d and \u201clove\u201d, and that it depends\non the deployment of critical notions like \u201cromantic\npoetry\u201d, wit, irony, allegory, myth and the creative\nimagination:\n\n\nIf we abstract from all knowledge and will\u2026we still find\nsomething more, that is feeling and striving. We\nwant to see if we will perhaps find something here that is analogous\nto the consciousness of the infinite\u2026. (F. Schlegel, ITP:\n244\u201345).\n\nPoetry elevates each single thing through a particular combination\nwith the rest of the whole, [by allowing] the individual [to] live in\nthe whole and the whole in the individual. (Novalis,\nPo\u00ebsie, NS 2: 533, #31).\n\n\nThe romantics believed that these aesthetic and affective attitudes\nmake it impossible for us to deny that there is something \u201cwhich\nis not I, nor comes from the I, and which is also not merely a\nNon-I\u201d (F. Schlegel, Thoughts, KA 18: #83). Baudelaire\nsummarizes these romantic sentiments, declaring, \n\n\nThe one who says romanticism says modern art\u2014which is to say\nintimacy, spirituality, color, aspiration towards the\ninfinite\u2014expressed by all the resources of art. (Salon of\n1846 [1981])\n\n\nWhat is it about the aesthetic engagement with art and beauty that is\nparticularly suitable for approximating the Absolute? The rest of this\nsection will develop a few possible answers to this question.\n",
