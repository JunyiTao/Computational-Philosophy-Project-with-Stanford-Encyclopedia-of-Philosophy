    "main_text": "\n\nJohannes (c.800\u2013c.877), who signed himself as\n\u201cEriugena\u201d in one manuscript, and who was referred to by\nhis contemporaries as \u201cthe Irishman\u201d\n(scottus\u2014in the ninth century Ireland was referred to\nas \u201cScotia Maior\u201d and its inhabitants as\n\u201cscotti\u201d) is the most significant Irish\nintellectual of the early monastic period. He is generally recognized\nto be both the most outstanding philosopher (in terms of originality)\nof the Carolingian era and of the whole period of Latin philosophy\nstretching from Boethius to Anselm. Eriugena is, also, though this\nparallel remains to be explored, more or less a contemporary of the\nArab Neoplatonist Al-Kindi. Since the seventeenth century, it has\nbecome usual to refer to this Irish philosopher as John Scottus (or\n\u201cScotus\u201d) Eriugena to distinguish him from the\nthirteenth-century\n John Duns Scotus (see entry).\n\nEriugena\u2019s uniqueness lies in the fact that, quite remarkably\nfor a scholar in Western Europe in the Carolingian era, he had\nconsiderable familiarity with the Greek language, affording him access\nto the Greek Christian theological tradition, from the Cappadocians to\nGregory of Nyssa, hitherto almost entirely unknown in the Latin West.\nHe also produced a complete, if somewhat imperfect, Latin translation\nof the Corpus Dionysii, the works of the obscure, possibly\nSyrian, Christian Neoplatonist, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, a\nfollower of Proclus. In addition, Eriugena translated Gregory of\nNyssa\u2019s De hominis opificio and Maximus\nConfessor\u2019s Ambigua ad Iohannem, and possibly other\nworks, such as Epiphanius\u2019 Anchoratus.\n\nEriugena\u2019s thought is best understood as a sustained attempt to\ncreate a consistent, systematic, Christian Neoplatonism from diverse\nbut primarily Christian sources. Eriugena had a unique gift for\nidentifying the underlying intellectual framework, broadly Neoplatonic\nbut also deeply Christian, assumed by the writers of the Christian\nEast. Drawing especially on Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Pseudo-Dionysius\nthe Areopagite, Maximus Confessor, as well as on the more familiar\nauthorities (auctores) of the Latin West (e.g., Cicero, Augustine, Macrobius,\nMartianus Capella, Boethius), he developed a highly\noriginal cosmology, where the highest principle, \u201cthe immovable\nself-identical one\u201d (unum et idipsum immobile,\nPeriphyseon, Patrologia Latina 122: 476b), engenders all\nthings and retrieves them back into itself. Contrary to what some\nearlier commentators supposed, it is most unlikely that Eriugena had\ndirect knowledge of the original texts of Plotinus, Porphyry, Proclus,\nor other pagan Neoplatonists, but he did have some direct knowledge of\nPlato (a portion of Timaeus in the translation of Calcidius)\nas well as familiarity with the pseudo-Augustinian Categoriae\ndecem.\n\nOverall, Eriugena develops a Neoplatonic cosmology according to which\nthe infinite, transcendent, and \u201cunknown\u201d God, who is\nbeyond being and non-being, through a process of self-articulation,\nprocession, or \u201cself-creation\u201d, proceeds from his divine\n\u201cdarkness\u201d or \u201cnon-being\u201d into the light of\nbeing, speaking the Word who is understood as Christ, and at the same\ntimeless moment bringing forth the Primary Causes of all creation.\nThese causes in turn proceed into their Created Effects and as such\nare creatures entirely dependent on, and will ultimately return to,\ntheir sources, which are the Causes or Ideas in God. These Causes,\nconsidered as diverse and infinite in themselves, are actually one\nsingle principle in the divine One. The whole of reality or nature, is\ninvolved in a dynamic process of outgoing (exitus) from and\nreturn (reditus) to the One. God is the One or the Good or\nthe highest principle, which transcends all, and which therefore may\nbe said to be \u201cthe non-being that transcends being\u201d. In an\noriginal departure from traditional Neoplatonism, in his dialogue\nPeriphyseon, this first and highest cosmic principle is\ncalled \u201cnature\u201d (natura) and is said to include\nboth God and creation.\n\nNature is defined as universitas rerum, the \u201ctotality\nof all things\u201d, and includes both the things which are (ea\nquae sunt) as well as those which are not (ea quae non\nsunt). This divine nature may be divided into a set of four\n\u201cspecies\u201d or \u201cdivisions\u201d (divisiones)\nwhich nevertheless retain their unity with their source. These four\ndivisions of nature taken together are to be understood as God,\npresented as the \u201cBeginning, Middle, and End of all\nthings\u201d.\n\nApart from having a minor influence in France in the ninth century,\nEriugena\u2019s cosmological speculations appear too conceptually\nadvanced for the philosophers and theologians of his time, and his\nphilosophical system was generally neglected in the tenth and eleventh\ncenturies. His main work, Periphyseon, was revived by\ntwelfth-century Neoplatonists, and also circulated in a compendium,\nClavis Physicae (The Key of Nature) of Honorius\nAugustodunensis. The Periphyseon was popular among the\nphilosophers of Chartres and St. Victor (e.g., Hugh of St. Victor\nrefers to it) but was condemned in the thirteenth century, alongside\nthe writings of David of Dinant and Amaury of B\u00e8ne, for\npromoting the identity of God and creation. In the fourteenth and\nfifteenth centuries, Eriugena continued to have a relatively\nclandestine but still important influence on Christian Neoplatonists\nsuch as Meister Eckhart and especially Nicholas of Cusa. The first\nprinted editions of his works appeared in the seventeenth century, but\nit was not until the nineteenth century that interest in him was\nrevived, especially among followers of Hegel who saw Eriugena as a\nforerunner to speculative idealism, as a \u201cProclus of the\nWest\u201d (Haur\u00e9au, 1872) and the \u201cFather of\nSpeculative Philosophy\u201d (Huber, 1861).  The first truly\nscholarly attempt to establish the facts of his life, his works and\ninfluence was by the Belgian scholar Maiul Cappuyns, whose 1933\nwork Jean Scot Erig\u00e8ne: sa vie, son oeuvre, sa\npens\u00e9e is still reliable. Many valuable twentieth-century\nstudies (e.g., Contreni, 1992; Marenbon, 1981, 2006; Schrimpf, 1982;\nO\u2019Meara, 1969, 1988) have explored Eriugena\u2019s Carolingian\nbackground and continuity with Latin authors. However, systematic\nstudies of his thought (Beierwaltes, 1980, 1987, 1990; Gersh, 1978,\n2006; Moran, 1989, 1999) have also recognized him as a highly original\nmetaphysician and speculative thinker of the first rank whose work\ntranscends the limitations of his age and mode of expression.\n",
