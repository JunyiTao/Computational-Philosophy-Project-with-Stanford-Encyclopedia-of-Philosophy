    "main_text": "Mohist Views on Logic and Language || Principles of Reason and Inference\n3.2 Principles of Reason and Inference\n\nBeyond these superficial similarities with the basic logical notions\nof contemporary formal-theoretical systems, there is a great deal of\nmaterial in the Mohist Canons that is indisputably concerned\nwith articulating logical principles, but whose interpretation is\nstill highly debatable. Scholars have extrapolated from Mohists texts\nversions of principles common to Western systems of symbolic logic,\nsuch as basic rules of inference (modus ponens, modus\ntollens, hypothetical syllogism), necessary and sufficient\nconditions, the laws of non-contradiction and excluded middle, and\nreductio ad absurdum. Intriguingly, we also find what appears\nto be a formulation of the liar paradox, first attributed in the West\nto Eubulides in the 4th century BCE: \u201cTo claim that\nall saying contradicts itself is self-contradictory. Explained by:\nwhat he says himself\u201d (B71). It is hard to believe that the\nMohists had anything in mind here but a precise notion of logical\ninconsistency.\n\nObservations such as these might encourage the view that the later\nMohists were uncovering basic principles of reasoning that we all\nshare, regardless of culture or history. For instance, using their\nstock examples of \u201cox\u201d and \u201cnon-ox\u201d for\ncontrary terms, the Mohists assert of any general kind that\n\n\n[o]ne calling it \u201cox\u201d and the other \u201cnon-ox\u201d\nis \u201ccontending over claims which are the converse of each\nother\u201d,\n\n\nand that\n\n\n[s]uch being the case, they do not both fit the fact. (A74)\n\n\nIf these statements are really about converse claims, as\nGraham\u2019s translation contends (e.g., \u201cThis is an\nox\u201d, and \u201cThis is a non-ox\u201d), then the Mohists\nappear be to asserting something quite like a version of the principle\nof non-contradiction formulated in Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics, in which it is stated of any two contradictory\npropositions that they cannot both be true simultaneously (IV 6\n1011b13\u201320, Kirwan 1993). Moreover, B35 appears to recognize\nthat they cannot both be false (\u201cTo say that there is no winner\nin disputation necessarily does not fit the fact\u201d), suggesting a\nversion of the principle of excluded middle.\n\nStill, it is hasty to assume any resemblance here amounts to an\nequivalence. Aristotle\u2019s principles are grounded in a theory of\npredication that is anything but neutral with respect to the basic\nstructure of a proposition. A categorical proposition has a\nsubject-predicate structure that partly determines whether or not it\nis true, and this structure contributes to the explanation of the\nassertoric force of this proposition when asserted. There is no clear\nevidence that the Mohists were making a point here about truth, if\ntruth is conceived as a semantic property of propositions that have a\nsubject-predicate structure. Indeed, some scholars have rejected the\nidea that a subject-predicate structure is a necessary condition of\nsentences of even contemporary Chinese, let alone is classical forbear\n(e.g., Han 2009). Tiles and Yuan (2004) argue that the\nsubject-predicate structure of Aristotle\u2019s categorical\npropositions only makes sense against the backdrop of a classificatory\nsystem in which things are categorized in terms of genera and species,\nsomething absent in early Chinese philosophers\u2019 emphasis on\ncontext-dependent relationships among things in varying fields of\nfocus. That is, to assert \u201cThis is an ox\u201d is not to\nidentify a substance in terms of a species of things to which it\nbelongs, but to make an association between one thing and other things\nwith the same name according to a presupposed criterion or standard,\nwhich varies depending on the context in which the association is\nmade. More fundamentally, A.C. Graham claims that the proposition was\na philosophical discovery only of the later Mohists, with their\nearlier counterparts primarily interested in teasing out the\nphilosophical implications of individual terms and their combinations\nin expressions (2003 [1978]). But in his view this discovery did not\nlead to an analysis of subject-predicate structure. Chad Hansen (1983)\neven rejects the view that early Chinese philosophers were concerned\nwith articulating theories of truth, suggesting instead that their\nprimary focus was on the pragmatic, behavior-guiding functions of\nlanguage, and how these functions contribute to normative views about\nproper ethical discourse and conduct.\n\nThese important questions aside, it is clear that the Mohists had a\nprimary interest in determining the conditions under which two or more\nobjects may be regarded as the same (tong) or different\n(yi). Correlatively, they looked for conditions in which an\nobject is admissibly characterized as of a certain kind. This prompted\nthe Mohists to recognize names of different types, three in\nparticular: unrestricted (da), classifying (lei),\nand private (si). In A78 the Mohists assert that\n\u201cnaming something \u2018horse\u2019 is classifying it\u201d,\nand that \u201cfor \u2018what is like the object\u2019 we\nnecessarily use this name\u201d, indicating that the name\n\u2018horse\u2019 applies to a class of objects that are in some\nsense relevantly similar. By contrast, \u201cnaming someone\n\u2018Zang\u2019\u201d (or, say, the proper name\n\u2018Jack\u2019) \u201cis \u2018private\u2019\u201d, a\n\u201cname which stays confined to this object\u201d. Names that are\n\u201cprivate\u201d refer to single individuals and no others. These\ntwo kinds of names are distinguished from the universal\n\u2018thing\u2019, of which the Mohists assert, \u201cany object\nnecessarily (bi) requires this name\u201d.\n\nWith this, the Mohist art of disputation concentrates on pairs of\ncomplementary names (e.g., \u201cox\u201d and \u201cnon-ox\u201d)\nto determine which is admissibly applied to an object. Together, the\ntwo names in each pair partition all that exists into two mutually\nexclusive categories. Any given object is in one or the other category\nof each pair, but not both. Accordingly, the names of each pair cannot\nboth \u201cfit\u201d the object, nor can it be the case that neither\nfits. It is in these terms that the Mohists recognized what we would\nidentify as the principles of non-contradiction and excluded middle.\nTheir primary interest is with naming and reference, and only\nconsequentially are they drawn into reflections on meaning. In an act\nof reference, one\u2019s utterance of \u201cThis is an ox\u201d\nmight be explained as the expression of a proposition in a speech act\nwith assertoric force. But this explanation depends on a general\ntheory about the relation between reference and meaning, something the\nMohists did not explicitly investigate. Their increasing interest in\nhow names combine into meaningful wholes may have put them on the\nverge of developing such a theory, but their focus remained mostly at\nthe level of particular acts of naming and uses of words. This makes\nit an open question whether or to what extent the logical principles\nunderwriting their specific views on reference, and their general\ntheory of language, are adequately characterized in Aristotelian terms\nor in some other way.\n\nInference is commonly understood as a syntactic operation on the form\nof a sentence or assertion that preserves the semantic property of\ntruth. Aristotle\u2019s logic, in which validity is determined by an\nargument\u2019s categorical form independently of the truth of its\npremises and the semantics of its terms, is an example. Like most\nother early Chinese philosophers, the Mohists do not appear to have\nconceived of valid inference in this way. Even as they gave increasing\nattention to matters of logical or grammatical form, they remained\nskeptical that different categories of form can be regarded as an\ninvariable guide to meaning. In particular, they were consistently\nwary of assuming that the meaning of a sentence or complex is\ndetermined by the meanings of its constituent parts and their modes of\ncombination. For this reason they maintained that valid inference is\npartly a semantic affair, hinging on our consideration of the\nidiosyncrasies of meanings in combination. So rather than developing a\ntheory of inference strictly on the basis of appeals to logical or\nlinguistic form, they instead sought to develop a viable\nclassification of what they took to be valid inference patterns based\non analogies in the semantics of terms in combination (see\n section 3.4\n below).\n\nThis prioritizing of semantics over formal logic had the effect of\nencouraging a rather different conception of argumentation based\nmainly on patterns of analogical reasoning, which the Mohists referred\nto as bian. Fraser 2013 argues that bian is\nunderstood in classical Chinese texts with an assortment of meanings\nof different levels of generality. Broadly speaking, it refers to\nprocesses of reasoning and disputation, basic operations of cognition,\nand the means by which we acquire knowledge. But in its more specific\nuse it involves correlating things based on their similarities and\ndifferences, and drawing conclusions from the distinctions thus\nestablished. Given that objects are found to resemble one another in\ndifferent ways, we correlate them consistently only in virtue of a\nmodel or standard (fa), which the Mohists define in A70 of\nthe Canons as \u201cthat in being like which something is\nso\u201d. By ascertaining the resemblance relation between other\nobjects and the standard, we apply the name consistently and identify\na class. Thus, to answer the question of whether or not we should\npredicate of something x the name G, the Mohists\nwould typically identify a model m (a particular object) for\nG, and then inquire whether x resembles the model.\nIf it does, then they would assert \u201cx is\nG\u201d as a consequence.\n\nThe Mohist conception of valid inference may depart from many Western\naccounts in another way as well. Given their prevailing tendency to\nregard the action guiding significance of language as its principal\nfunction, the Mohists were likely compelled to think of the semantic\nproperty that is preserved in valid inference not simply in\ndescriptive terms, but in normative ones as well. It is for this\nreason that scholars of early Chinese philosophy often prefer to\ntranslate the Chinese evaluative term ke as\n\u201cadmissibility\u201d, as opposed to \u201ctruth\u201d, since\nthe Mohist conception of the correct use of a sentence was closely\ntied to presuppositions about proper social conduct. In this way,\nvalid inference was construed as having complex justificatory import.\nFor instance, in claiming that an action x is humane\n(ren) by its resemblance with the conduct of a sage, one is\nalso providing justification for it as such, because one is asserting\nin the act of naming that it resembles the model for humane action,\nand resembling this model is the very condition that justifies calling\nit such. (Recall again that naming something is classifying it, such\nthat for anything else that is like it one is obligated to use the\nsame name.) Moreover, asserting that x is humane justifies\nthe claim that it ought to be recognized as such, because the\nmodel which it resembles (in being a model) is the very\njustification for how the name ought to be used. Its resemblance\ncarries with it the normative requirement that language users\nrecognize it as such, for that is what would be expected of a language\nwhose principal function is to guide behavior and encourage proper\nsocial conduct. Arguably, the English terms \u201cadmissible\u201d\nand \u201cinadmissible\u201d come closer to capturing this notion\nthan the more neutral terms \u201ctruth\u201d and\n\u201cfalsehood\u201d.\n",
