    "main_text": "Difficulties and Objections || Nonuniqueness of quasiclassical frameworks\n11.3 Nonuniqueness of quasiclassical frameworks\nAn objection first raised by Dowker &\nKent (1996), and subsequently repeated by \nKent (1998),\nSchlosshauer (2004),\nand Wallace (2008), among others, is that\nquasiclassical frameworks are by no means the only possible consistent families\nof histories in a closed quantum system.  In particular, one can have\nconsistent families in which there is quasiclassical behavior up to some time\nfollowed by something which is not at all quasiclassical at a later time.  This\nwould be a serious objection if historians were claiming that there must be a\nunique family of histories which can be used to describe the world, but such is\nnot the case.  The physicist is at Liberty to choose a family whose histories\nclosely resemble those of classical mechanics, and the existence of alternative\nframeworks in no way diminishes the validity of such a quasiclassical\ndescription, for reasons indicated in section 4.2 of Griffiths (2013).\nOne senses that underlying such criticisms is the expectation that any good\nphysical theory must satisfy the principle of unicity, to which\nwe now turn.\n",
