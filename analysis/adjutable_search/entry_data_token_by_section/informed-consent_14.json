    "main_text": "Informed consent || Cogency\n4.4 Cogency\n\nWhether being informed is cashed out in terms of disclosure or of\ncomprehension, and whichever standard is used, asking that patients or\nstudy participants be even adequately informed is sometimes asking too\nmuch. U.S. federal regulations waive the information requirement in\nresearch for some studies that involve no more than a minimal risk. In\nclinical care, many patients would rather not think about risks and\nprognoses that would turn their stomachs and that they can do little\nabout. In some such contexts it seems cogent not to demand informing\nin any form (see sections 6, 7 below). However, outright lies surely\nremain forbidden even in such circumstances. A possible conclusion is\nthat informed consent encompasses several layers of requirement that\ndiffer in their stringency.\n",
