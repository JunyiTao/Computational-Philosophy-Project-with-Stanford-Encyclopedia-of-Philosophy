    "main_text": "Autonomy in Social and Political Philosophy || Autonomy and Political Liberalism\n3.6 Autonomy, Justice and Democracy\n\nIn closing, we should add a word about the implications of political\nliberalism for the traditional division between liberal justice and\ndemocratic theory. I say \u201cdivision\u201d here, but different\nviews of justice and democracy will convey very different conceptions\nof the relation between the two (see Christiano 1996, Lakoff 1996).\nBut traditionally, liberal conceptions of justice have viewed\ndemocratic mechanisms of collective choice as essential but highly\ncircumscribed by the constitutional provisions that principles of\njustice support. Individual rights and freedoms, equality before the\nlaw, and various privileges and protections associated with citizen\nautonomy are protected by principles of justice and hence not subject\nto democratic review, on this approach (Gutmann 1993).\n\nHowever, liberal conceptions of justice have themselves evolved (in\nsome strains at least) to include reference to collective discussion\nand debate (public reason) among the constitutive conditions of\nlegitimacy. It could be claimed, then, that basic assumptions about\ncitizens\u2019 capacities for reflective deliberation and choice\n\u2014 autonomy \u2014 must be part of the background conditions\nagainst which an overlapping consensus or other sort of political\nagreement concerning principles of justice is to operate.\n\nSome thinkers have made the connection between individual or\n\u201cprivate\u201d autonomy and collective or \u201cpublic\u201d\nlegitimacy \u2014 prominent, most notably Habermas (Habermas 1994).\nOn this view, legitimacy and justice cannot be established in advance\nthrough philosophical construction and argument, as was thought to be\nthe case in natural law traditions in which classical social contract\ntheory flourished and which is inherited (in different form) in\ncontemporary perfectionist liberal views. Rather, justice amounts to\nthat set of principles that are established in practice and rendered\nlegitimate by the actual support of affected citizens (and\ntheir representatives) in a process of collective discourse and\ndeliberation (see e.g., Fraser 1997, 11\u201340 and Young 2000).\nSystems of rights and protections (private, individual autonomy) will\nnecessarily be protected in order to institutionalize frameworks of\npublic deliberation (and, more specifically, legislation and\nconstitutional interpretation) that render principles of social\njustice acceptable to all affected (in consultation with others)\n(Habermas 1994, 111).\n\nThis view of justice, if at all acceptable, provides an indirect\ndefense of the protection of autonomy and, in particular,\nconceptualizing autonomy in a way that assumes reflective self-\nevaluation. For only if citizen participants in the public discourse\nthat underlies justice are assumed to have (and provided the basic\nresources for having) capacities for competent self- reflection, can\nthe public defense and discussion of competing conceptions of justice\ntake place (cf. Gaus 1996, Parts II and III, Gaus 2011). Insofar as\nautonomy is necessary for a functioning democracy (considered very\nbroadly), and the latter is a constitutive element of just political\ninstitutions, then autonomy must be seen as reflective self-appraisal\n(and, I would add, non-alienation from central aspects of one\u2019s\nperson) (see Cohen 2002, Richardson 2003, Christman 2015).\n\nThis approach to justice and autonomy, spelled out here in rough and\ngeneral form, has certainly faced criticism. In particular, those\ntheorists concerned with the multi-dimensional nature of social and\ncultural \u201cdifference\u201d have stressed how the conception of\nthe autonomous person assumed in such principles (as well as criteria\nfor rational discourse and public deliberation) is a contestable ideal\nnot internalized by all participants in contemporary political life\n(see, e.g., Brown 1995, Benhabib 1992). Others motivated by\npost-modern considerations concerning the nature of the self,\nrationality, language, and identity, are also suspicious of the manner\nin which the basic concepts operative in liberal theories of justice\n(\u201cautonomy\u201d for example) are understood as fixed,\ntransparent, and without their own political presuppositions (see,\ne.g., Butler 1990; for general discussion see White 1990).\n\nThese charges are stated here much too generally to give an adequate\nresponse in this context. But the challenge remains for any theory of\njustice which rests on a presumption of the normative centrality of\nautonomy. To be plausible in a variously pluralistic social setting,\none marked by ongoing histories of oppressive practices and\ninstitutions, such a view must avoid the twin evils of forcibly\nimposing a (reasonably) contested value on resistant citizens, on the\none hand, and simply abandoning all normative conceptions of social\norder in favor of open ended struggle for power on the other. The view\nthat individuals ought to be treated as, and given the resources to\nbecome, autonomous in one of the minimal senses outlined here will, I\nsubmit, be a central element in any political view that steers between\nthe Scylla of oppressive forms of perfectionism and the Charybdis of\ninterest-group power politics.\n",
