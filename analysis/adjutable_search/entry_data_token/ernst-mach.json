[Mach, Analysis of Sensations,\nPreface to 1st Edition]\n\n\nErnst Mach (February 18, 1838 \u2013 February 19, 1916) made major\ncontributions to physics, philosophy, and physiological\npsychology. In physics, the speed of sound bears his name, as he was\nthe first to systematically study super-sonic motion. He also made\nimportant contributions to understanding the Doppler effect. His\ncritique of Newtonian ideas of absolute space and time were an\ninspiration to the young Einstein, who credited Mach as being the\nphilosophical forerunner of relativity theory. His systematic\nskepticism of the old physics was similarly important to a generation\nof young German physicists.\n\n\nIn philosophy, he is best known for his influence upon the Vienna\nCircle (a predecessor of which was named the Ernst Mach Verein), for\nhis famous anti-metaphysical attitude (which developed into the\nverifiability theory of meaning), for his anti-realist stance in\nopposition to atomism, and in general for his positivist-empiricist\napproach to epistemology. It is important to note that some of these\ninfluences are currently being re-examined, and are now thought to be\nboth more tenuous and more complicated than was once assumed. He was\nalso an important historian of science, and occupied the Chair for the\nPhilosophy of the Inductive Sciences at the University of\nVienna. Although previous philosophers had commented on science and\nmany scientists had influenced philosophy, Mach more than anyone else\nbridged the divide; he is a founder of the philosophy of science.\n\n\nIn psychology, he studied the relationship of our sensations to\nexternal stimuli. Space, time, color, sound, once the domain of\nphysics, were now also being studied by psychologists and conceived of\nas not only the stuff of the physical external world but also the\nelements of our inner experience. Mach was deeply inspired by\nGustav Fechner\u2019s psychophysics here. Psychologists today\nregard him as a founder of Gestalt theory as well as the discoverer of\nneural inhibition. Importantly, although in the twentieth century\nhe was better known to philosophers for his influence upon physics and\nthe philosophy of physics, it was psychology that was the primary\ndriving force behind his philosophy of science.\n\n\nIn his later years (1901), Mach was appointed to the Austrian\nParliament, where he was known as a reformer. His intellectual\ninfluence amongst leftists was so great that Lenin wrote a book,\nMaterialism and Empirico-Criticism, criticizing Machian\nanti-materialism.\n", "toc": [{"#Sum": "1.

Summary\n\n\nA broad foundation is laid for the theory in question, and light is\nshed upon it from new sides, if, in conformity with the stimulus given\nby Darwinism, we conceive of all psychical life \u2014 including\nscience \u2014 as biological appearance, and if we apply to the theory\nthe Darwinian conceptions of struggle for existence, of development,\nand of selection. [Analysis of Sensations, 49\u201350]\n\n\n\n\nMach was a naturalist and a monist, as well as an anti-materialist\nin the sense of being an anti-mechanist. The connection between\nnaturalism and materialism is an important one for Mach.\nNaturalism, in its simplest sense, is the doctrine that there is\nnothing beyond nature, not even the organic or mental, and evolution is\nthus generally a crucial component of it. The materialism of the\nmechanical philosophy is the further view that this nature consists of\nmatter in motion, and in particular that psychic phenomena can be\nreduced to matter in motion. Although materialism can make as\nmuch use of evolution as naturalism, Mach\u2019s nineteenth century\nevolutionary views influenced his anti-materialism. Whereas\nmechanistic materialism views nature as an organized system of billiard\nballs, Mach\u2019s evolutionary perspective viewed nature as a dynamic\nprocess.\n\n\nMach is part of the empiricist tradition, but he also believed in\nsomething like a priori truths. But it is a biologized a\npriori: what is a priori to an individual organism\nwas a posteriori to its ancestors; not only does the a\npriori pre-form experience, but the a priori is itself\nformed from experience. It was simultaneously the contradiction and\nconfirmation of Kantian epistemology. In as much as Kant used\nthe a priori to explain how knowledge is possible, Mach uses\nthe knowledge of the new sciences to explain how an a priori is\npossible. One more patch of philosophy, it was thought, yielded to\nscience.\n\n\nMach\u2019s empiricism is complicated. It has its roots in\nthe belief that knowledge is a product of evolution, that our senses,\nminds, and cultures have an evolutionary history. It was simple\nexperience to which early organisms responded, and it was out of simple\nexperiences that the first images of the world were constructed.\nThese constructions became a priori, allowing new and more complicated\nunderstandings, and so forth. This process is in a sense repeated\nin development; individual development begins through a process of the\ninteraction of simple sensations with those innate capacities formed in\nour ancestors. Out of this, more complex understandings arise;\nthe process continues. Science furthers this biological process\nby bringing our primitive conceptions into contact with new\nenvironments, thus causing mental adaptation. The one and same\nprocess unites all features of activity in nature: the adaptation\nof early life to primordial environments and the adaptation of modern\nscience to new data are unified under the principle of experience\nforcing adaptation in memory. Though loosely an empiricist in\nthis sense, he rejected Locke\u2019s tabula rasa, and aligned\nhimself against the more empiricist Helmholtz and towards the nativist\nEwald Hering in their famous nature-nurture debates. He is not in\nthe least a traditional empiricist.\n\n\nMach is generally considered a \u2018positivist\u2019. However, this\ntells us little, as positivism is really a collection of traditions,\nconnected often by misunderstandings as much as by actual intellectual\nagreement. Furthermore, the word today has come to mean something so\nfar removed from its nineteenth century origins as to be practically\nharmful in understanding the how it was used in the nineteenth\ncentury. Outside of the social sciences (where it is alive and well),\nthe word \u2018positivism\u2019 seems to be used mostly by\npost-modernists, deconstructionists, and the Frankfurt school as a\nword to represent that branch of the enlightenment tradition that\nfailed; it has become the \u2018other\u2019 which we all know is\nwrong without having to know what it is. Comte was a Positivist. Mach,\ntoo, was a Positivist, but Mach probably has more in common with\nHusserl than Comte, and certainly more in common with James.\n\n\nMach is not a phenomenalist under normal uses of this term, but this\ncertainly requires investigation. First, to whatever extent he was a\nphenomenalist, he was a \u2018scientific\u2019 phenomenalist: his\nideas were not derived from philosophical skepticism but through\napplication of the results of psychology and evolutionary theory. He\nprovides clues as to how we should understand his infamous\n\u201celements\u201d\u2014they are related to the thought of\nFechner and Ewald Hering. Secondly, he advocated that physics should\ndescribe relations of experience as much as possible; in his time this\nwas termed \u2018phenomenological physics\u2019. This was clearly\nmeant as a methodological suggestion, arising out of the way he\nthought physics could best respond to the challenges presented to it\nby the life sciences.  Thirdly, he writes that his ideas were the same\nas Avenarius who had approached questions of the relationship between\nthe psychical and the physical from a physicalistic\nperspective. Although Mach undoubtedly adopts a sensationalist basis,\nthis foundation is not crucial for Mach. He recognizes the\npossibility of other foundations:\n\n\n\u2026 many readers have found a stumbling-block in what they\ntook, erroneously indeed, to be the general character of my conception\nof the universe. And, to begin with, I must say that anyone who,\nin spite of repeated protests from myself and from other quarters,\nidentifies my view with that of Berkeley, is undoubtedly very far\nremoved from a proper appreciation of my position. This\nmisconception is no doubt partly due to the fact that my view was\ndeveloped from an earlier idealistic phase, which has left on my\nlanguage traces which are probably not even yet entirely\nobliterated. For, of all the approaches to my standpoint, the one\nby way of idealism seems to me the easiest and most natural\u2026. I\nfeel it to be a piece of particularly good fortune that Avenarius has\ndeveloped the same conception of the relation between the physical\nand psychical on an entirely realistic, or, if the phrase be preferred,\na materialistic foundation \u2026 [italics mine;\nAS: 361\u20132; see also 358]\n\n\nExperimental psychology had just been founded. Mach\u2019s elements\nare, quite simply, the variables of a major branch of psychology, the\nnew field of psychophysics. Mach was part of the first generation\nof physiological psychologists that thought they had broken through the\nprimeval walls dividing the physical from the mental. They\nthought they had solved this ancient problem through a scientific,\nmonistic unification. The physical was characterized by its\nability to be quantified: it was part of science.\nNow, the realm of Geist was falling under the same methods\nused so successfully in physics. Following the pioneering work of\nFechner, they had measured sensation and found that the\nrelationship of external stimulus to inner response followed\nmathematical law. Fueled further by developments in evolutionary\ntheory, their optimism soared, perhaps a bit too high. As\nso often happens in periods of scientific optimism, these new\ndiscoveries called for a philosophy in which they would be at\nhome. Mach not only took up this challenge, but as a physicist\nalso applied the results of this tradition to the categories of\nphysics.\n\n\nModern psychologists regard Mach as the forerunner of the idea of\nneural nets in perception. He discovered that the eye has a mind\nof its own; we perceive not direct stimuli but relations of\nstimuli. The visual system operates through a process of\ncontinual adaptation of the present sensation to previous ones.\nWe do not experience \u2018reality\u2019 but rather experience the\nafter effects of our nervous system\u2019s adaptations to new\nstimuli. Furthermore, from an evolutionary perspective, it was\nnecessary that this relational nature of perception be\nso. What were once thought of as errors of the brain, Mach showed\nto be adaptations. His argument is brilliant and he is cited even\ntoday in psychology textbooks for these contributions.\nFurthermore, his work in physiology influenced his epistemology.\nIf we perceive not things directly but contrasts of things, then the\nworld is a biological construction formed through the process of our\nnervous system adapting to new sensations. Representationalist\ntheories of perception, which posit a direct correspondence between\nappearance and reality, become untenable.\n\n\nMach is also considered by Gestalt theorists to be one of their\nforerunners. Christian von Ehrenfels, the founder of Gestalt\ntheory, begins his seminal 1890 paper \u201c\u00dcber\nGestaltqualit\u00e4ten\u201d by reviewing Gestalt ideas in\nMach\u2019s Analysis of Sensations. These ideas arose\nin the context of his research on Mach bands where he realized that the\nmind and senses actively contribute to sensation. The\nAnalysis of Sensations is full of examples of this sort; its\ncentral concern is to understand the dynamic relation between our\ncognitive structure and experience. Our cognitive structure is\nitself formed through previous experience, and our current experience\nis structured by it in turn.\n2. Biography and Early Development\n\n\nMach was born in Moravia on Feb 18, 1838. In 1840 his family\nmoved to a farm in Untersiebenbrunn, Lower Austria. He studied\nphysics at the University of Vienna from 1855 to 1861, continuing on as\na lecturer until 1864. After spending three years as Professor of\nMathematics at Graz, he received a Chair at Prague where he stayed\nuntil 1895. For the next six years, Mach occupied a Chair in the\nHistory and Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences at Vienna. He\nsuffered a stroke in 1898 and retired in 1901. He died near\nMunich in 1916.\n\n\nHe credited his philosophical awakening to reading, at age fifteen,\nhis father\u2019s copy of Kant\u2019s Prolegomena to any Future\nMetaphysics:\n\n\nThe book made at the time a powerful and ineffaceable impression\nupon me, the like of which I never afterwards experienced in any of my\nphilosophical reading. Some two or three years later the\nsuperfluity of the role played by \u201cthe thing in itself\u201d\nabruptly dawned upon me. On a bright summer day in the open air,\nthe world with my ego suddenly appeared to me as one coherent\nmass of sensations, only more strongly coherent in the ego.\nAlthough the actual working out of this thought did not occur until a\nlater period, yet this moment was decisive for my whole view.\n[AS: 30fn]\n\n\nMach attended an Austrian Gymnasium in Moravia, graduating at\nseventeen, entering the University of Vienna as a student of\nmathematics and physics in 1855, and matriculating in 1860.\nAfter graduation, he stayed in Vienna as a privat dozent,\nsupporting himself through giving lectures paid for directly by\nstudents (which means he made very little money).\n\n\nIt was in these years at Vienna that Mach began his interest in\nphysiology. Johannes M\u00fcller and his students had started a\nnew school of physiology in the 1840s. Initially centered\nin Berlin, it came to Vienna following the political reforms of 1848 in\nthe guise of Ernst Br\u00fcke and Carl Ludwig, a former a student of\nM\u00fcller. This new school was characterized not just by\na general suspicion of vitalism (though M\u00fcller remained a vitalist\nof sorts), but more by an agreement on the importance of the\napplication of physical-chemical methods to the biological\nsciences. Carl Ludwig, Herman von Helmholtz, and Ernst Haeckel also\nstudied under M\u00fcller. Although his degree was in physics, Mach\nenrolled as a student of the Medical Faculty, taking 22 hours of\nclasses in physiology, chemistry, and anatomy. In 1861 he taught\na course in physics for medical students, out of which he developed his\ntextbook, Compendium der Physik f\u00fcr Mediciner. He\nalso published his first article on psychophysics, \u00dcber das\nSehen von Lagen und Winkeln durch die Bewegung des Auges, where he\nstudied the relationship between tension in the eye muscles and\nperception of form. This work also contains Mach\u2019s first\nreference to Fechner, whose influential Elements of\nPsychophysics was published in 1860. During the next years\nin Vienna, he also taught classes in psychophysics and a class entitled\nDie Principien der Mechanik und mechanischen Physik in ihrer\nhistorischen Entwicklung, which possibly marks the start of his\ninterest in the history of science (though we do not know the actual\ncontents of the lectures). Mach was also influenced by\nHelmholtz\u2019s Die Lehre von den Tonempfindungen.\n\n\nMach\u2019s first important scientific contribution was over the\nrecently discovered \u2018Doppler theory\u2019. In 1841,\nChristian Doppler noticed that sound changes in frequency as a source\nmoves toward and away from an observer. By 1845 he had\ngeneralized this to include all wave phenomena, including light.\nTwo prominent physicists, Petzval and \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m, challenged\nDoppler. Mach devised a simple apparatus that demonstrated that\nthe Doppler effect was real, at least for sound. A six-foot tube\nwith a whistle at one end was mounted so as to rotate in a vertical\nplane. When the listener stood in the plane of the axis of\nrotation no changes in pitch could be heard. But if the observer\nstood in the plane of rotation, fluctuations in pitch that corresponded\nto the speed of rotation could be heard. The application of this\nwork to Doppler effects with light remained controversial, but Mach is\nregarded as one of the first to realize the possibility of studying a\nstar\u2019s spectrum to understand its movements [see Blackmore 1972:\n17\u201319; Swoboda 1974: 20\u201375].\n\n\nMach was highly influenced by Johann Herbart during this period, not\nonly through Herbart\u2019s writings, but also through Franz Lott,\nVienna\u2019s Herbartian spokesperson and Mach\u2019s good\nfriend. In Herbart, Mach found a mechanical approach to\npsychology and physiology that coincided with Mach\u2019s early\nacceptance of atomism. As his interests shifted to physiology and\npsychology, the mechanical models remained, but the atomism became less\nimportant. Eventually, the mechanical approach to physiology gave\nway to an evolutionary approach, and as the mechanical approach lost\nground here atomism did as well. This trend increased the deeper\nMach went into psychophysics, and eventually turned into an\nanti-mechanistic philosophy in Mach\u2019s mature thought. Mach\nmakes little mention of Herbart in his later writings; for instance,\nonly two brief references are made to Herbart in Analysis of\nSensations, both in the context of reflections on his intellectual\ndevelopment.\n\n\nIn 1864 Mach received an appointment in mathematics at Graz.\nFor the first time he had the money and freedom to carry out his own\nexperiments. In 1866 he exchanged his math chair for one in\nphysics. While at Graz he had personal contact with Fechner and\ncarried out his important work on Mach Bands. It was in this work\nthat Mach first made use of evolutionary theory. Mach started\nwork on what later became Analysis of Sensations, but\napparently was discouraged by Fechner\u2019s criticism. He\nreturned to this work twenty years later, after further developing his\nown ideas. It was also in Graz that Mach first encountered Ewald\nHering\u2019s thought, both in physiology and evolution. In\nMach\u2019s first article on Mach Bands [Mach 1865] he refers to\nHering, and in 1866 Hering gave his famous address on Unconscious\nMemory to the Vienna Academy. In 1867 Mach went to\nPrague as a professor of physics. He stayed in Prague for\ntwenty-eight years, until 1895, whereupon he returned to Vienna. It was\nin Prague that his mature thought developed.\n\n\nMach\u2019s name is, of course, associated with the speed of sound,\nwhere Mach 1 means the speed of sound in a given medium. Since the\nspeed of sound varies with the density of the medium it is traveling\nthrough, Mach numbers are not absolute quantities but relational\nones. In the late 1860s developments in gun and artillery technology\nproduced projectiles that traveled faster than sound vibrations. This\nwas realized over a period of time as two effects were\ninvestigated\u2014a second loud \u2018boom\u2019, distinct from the\nusual one of the explosion, as well as a different type of wound. It\nwas the latter that began Mach\u2019s interest. In 1868 warring\nEuropean powers had signed The St.  Petersburg Declaration that banned\na new type of bullet that exploded on impact, thus causing\n\u2018crater\u2019 type wounds. Soon thereafter, however, similar\ntypes of \u2018crater\u2019 wounds appeared again. Various theories\nover their cause were put forward, leading Mach to investigate. By\n1885 Mach had worked out the details of supersonic motion, along the\nway developing high-speed photographic techniques. Most importantly\nfor engineers, Mach Number is the ratio of the speed of the object to\nthe speed of sound in the given medium; his work is essential to\nmodern aerodynamics, and through it the word \u2018Mach\u2019 has\nbizarrely entered into popular culture as an icon for razors, sound\nsystems, fighter pilots, and high speed fuels.\n\n\nMach\u2019s early intellectual development was very much a product\nof the outstanding developments in the sciences of his time.\nWhereas a generation before, there existed only one truly mature\nscience, physics, by the early 1860s both psychology and biology\nhad entered the scientific scene. Previously, scientifically\nbased views on reality were essentially Newtonian-mechanistic.\nAfter Darwin and Fechner, the new sciences of psychology and\nevolutionary theory opened up new areas of philosophic-scientific\ninteraction. The possibility of a new scientific view opened up,\none based upon these new sciences, and sought to displace the Newtonian\nparadigm with one based upon developmental orientations.\n3. Psychology and the Life Sciences\n3.1 Gustav Fechner\n\n\nMy natural bent for the study of these questions received its\nstrongest stimulus twenty-five years ago from Fechner\u2019s\nElemente der Psychophysik \u2026 [AS:\nxxxvi]\n\n\nThe single greatest influence upon Mach was Fechner; this cannot be\noverstated. Fechner\u2019s The Elements of\nPsychophysics was published in 1860, but Mach was aware of the\nideas in it before. The definitive account of Fechner is Michael\nHeidelberger\u2019s book Nature from Within [2004].\n\n\nFechner founded experimental psychology by developing a method of\n\u2018measuring\u2019 the psychical. Our senses have\nthresholds of perception; that is, given any amount of stimulation of a\nsense, there is an amount more of that stimulation which is required\nfor us to notice it. Furthermore, that amount increases\nlogarithmically as the base-line sensation increases. This holds\ntrue, with complications and variations, for all of our\nsensations. The import was that there is a mathematical\nrelationship between the external world and the inner, between the\nphysical and the psychological. It was then possible to talk\nabout these dual aspects of reality in a neutral manner (see Neutral\nMonism). Fechner uses the word \u2018elements\u2019 for this\npurpose, and Mach\u2019s elements are directly related to them. With\nsome loss, embed Fechnerian methodology within nineteenth century evolutionary theory,\nand apply it to the categories of physics, and we get Machian\nepistemology.\n3.2 Mach Bands\n\n\nIn 1865 Mach published, \u201cOn the effect of the spatial\ndistribution of the light stimulus on the retina,\u201d the first of a\nseries of remarkable articles on what are now known today as Mach\nBands.\n\n\n\nMach Bands \u00a9 Alan Stubbs, from\n Perceptual Stuff.\n\nReproduced with permission.\n\n\n\nThe thin dark bands along the outer edges of the gradients and the\nthin light bands along the inner edges of the gradients are optical\nillusions. The cause of this effect is due to contrast perception; we\nover process at boundaries and under process where there is\nconstancy. In fact sensory response can even stop with unchanging\nstimulation. Mach is credited for discovering lateral inhibition in\nour sense organs, the idea that our senses pre-process information\nbefore sending it to the brain.\n\n\nBefore this period, optical illusions were understood as just that,\nerrors in judgment, quirks of the brain. The sense organs were\nseen as simple media with a direct link to the brain. Their only\nrole was to transmit a sensation to the brain, where it was then\ninterpreted. Mach argued that the processing does not\nall occur in the brain. The quirks of judgment are not due to\nprocessing errors in the brain, but innate features of the senses\nthemselves.\n\n\nThe immediate significance of this was that it provided a strong\nargument against direct representationalist theories of\nperception. There simply is no isomorphism between reality and\nappearance. But Mach took this even further, embedding it within\nhis evolutionary Fechnerian framework.\n\n\nMach argued that perception works through perceiving the relations\nbetween stimuli. And this process is at the root of all\nlife. The same process that drives evolution, drives perception,\nand even (as we shall see shortly) drives science.\n\n\nSince every retinal point perceives itself, so to speak, as above or\nbelow the average of its neighbors, there results a characteristic type\nof perception. Whatever is near the mean of the surroundings becomes\neffaced, whatever is above or below is disproportionately brought into\nprominence. One could say that the retina schematizes and\ncaricatures. The teleological significance of this process is\nclear in itself. It is an analog of abstraction and of the\nformation of concepts. [Mach 1868, in Ratliff 1965: 306]\n\n\nThat which is constant receives less attention, that which varies\nmust be brought into equilibrium. It is this process of bringing\ncontrasts into equilibrium which is at the basis of all organic\nprocesses, evolutionary, developmental, and perceptual. The\norganism is a dynamic system that has innate tendencies to\nself-regulation and equilibrium. When equilibrium is disturbed,\nwhich can happen on a variety of levels, the organism works to form a\nnew equilibrium. The senses are not things that got passively\nwritten on, but rather things that interact with environments.\nLife is not mechanistic but teleological.\n\n\nAnd this is not an accident, for can we imagine life\notherwise? Mach asks us to consider the following:\n\n\nLet us first ask how we would find our way in the visual world if we\nwould perceive, not relations of, but only differences in,\nillumination. One and the same thing in the same surroundings\nwould become immediately unrecognizable with the slightest alteration\nof light intensity, such as when a cloud covers the sun. Should\nwe still want to find our way, we would then have to habituate\nourselves to maintain equal levels of light intensity, for instance by\nclosing and opening our eyes. In fact, if this god of the\npsychophysical law were non-existent, the organism itself would have to\ndevise it and, if the Darwinian theory is correct, it has devised\nit. The seeing of light intensity relations, within certain\nlimits, is necessary for the existence of organisms. [Mach 1868 in\nRatliff 1965: 300]\n\n\nWe do not perceive the world in itself, Mach claims. If we did\nwe would perceive chaos. Thus we have evolved senses that\nperceive contrasts of perception, relations of perception.\nSensations by themselves can have no organic meaning; only the\nrelations of sensations to one another can have meaning.\nPerception, Mach believed, is never perception of direct stimuli.\n3.3 Gestalt Theory\n\n\nThis central Machian insight that perception is always relational and\nconstructed lies at the origins of Gestalt Theory. The seminal article\nof Gestalt Theory, Christian von Ehrenfels\u2019 1890\n\u201c\u00dcber Gestaltqualit\u00e4ten,\u201d begins with a\nreview of these ideas, found in Mach\u2019s 1886 Analysis of\nSensations. Sensations are not simply raw experiences, but the\ninteraction of experience with a pre-formed cognitive structure. For\ninstance, when we hear a known melody, we recognize it no matter what\nkey it is played in. It can be hummed, buzzed, or strummed on a\nguitar. Furthermore, even if one or more notes are incorrect, we still\nrecognize it. Mach asks, \u201cwhat constitutes a melody?\u201d It\nseems incorrect to say that the actual sound vibrations constitute the\nmelody as we have just seen that numerous different sounds can make\nthe same melody. But on the other hand, it seems empirically odd to\nsay that a melody is not constituted out of its sounds. The actual\nmelody, then, exists in our ability to recognize it. It is formed by\nexperience of one or more examples of the melody, but it is an\nidealization of that experience. Significantly, the idealization\ncaptures not the actual sounds, but the relationships of the\nsounds to one another. Thus a melody can be sung in a high or low\npitch, etc., but as long as the relationships remain the same we\nrecognize it as the same melody. For Mach, this process is at the\nbasis of all perception. Experience requires an \u2018a\npriori\u2019, but that a priori is itself formed by\nexperience.  This process is also at the root of evolutionary\nprocesses.\n3.4 Haeckel, Hering and Evolutionary Theory\n\n\n Nineteenth century evolutionary theory is complicated in that in the\ncultures which most obviously experienced a widespread acceptance of\nevolution, inspired apparently by Darwin\u2019s 1859 publication\nof Origin of the Species, evolutionary ideas had already been\npresent and Darwin\u2019s mechanism for evolutionary change, natural\nselection, was not necessarily accepted. Rather, more deeply\nteleological accounts of nature were often put forward within an\nevolutionary framework. Mach came of intellectual age in 1860, right\nwhen this explosion of evolutionary ideas was starting. Unlike the\ndisciplines of psychology and physics, he makes no contributions to\nevolutionary theory; however, his entire system is located within an\nevolutionary framework. This framework is not one that he argues for;\nrather, it was the metaphysics (yes, metaphysics) he adapted from his\nnineteenth century German intellectual culture. The two immediate\ninfluences on Mach in this regard were Herring and Haeckel, or at\nleast we can turn to their writings to understand the evolutionary\ntradition Mach was part of.\n\nThe greatest popularizer of evolutionary theory in the nineteenth\ncentury was of course Ernst Haeckel. Although he is now best known for\nhis infamous maxim, \u201contogeny recapitulates phylogeny\u201d,\nhis larger project was to put forward an evolutionary metaphysics; in\nparticular to offer a monistic unified account of our reality. His\nproject, overlapping significantly with that of Mach and Herring,\nsought to embed the developments of psychology within a theory of\nevolutionary development; evolution was the evolution of not just the\nspecies but also of the psyche.\n\n\nIn late nineteenth century continental Europe a different notion of\n\u2018direction\u2019 existed than the one that Darwin directly\nattacked. Whereas the theory of natural selection maintains that\nevolution is a directionless process having no guiding factor or end\npoint, relying rather on selection within particular environments on\nrandom variations thrown up by the chaos of nature, Hering, Haeckel,\nand Mach were part of a German tradition which held that there is an\ninner telos in nature. Hering and Mach were atheists, and disbelieved\nin a soul, but still accepted the idea that nature had internal\ndirection. As will be shown later, this idea of internal\ndirection extends for Mach all the way up to his ideas on the purpose\nof science.\n\n\nHering was Mach\u2019s close friend, political ally, academic\npartner, and second only to Fechner in terms of total influence.\nHering was also a fellow Fechnerian (he studied under Fechner), and he\nshared both Mach\u2019s bio-psychological orientation and nativist\ntheories of spatial intuition. Hering is known for his work in\nbinocular vision and for his debates with Helmholtz over color vision,\nand also for his address to the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna,\n\u201cOn Memory as a Universal Function of Organized\nMatter\u201d.\n3.5 Monism\n\n\nAll three were also leaders in the Monist movement. It is no accident\nthat one of the oldest philosophy journals is The Monist\n(started in 1888). A look through its early volumes reveals a mixture\nof scientific applications to the various categories of human\nexistence. Mach was a frequent contributor, and indeed a good friend\nof the editor, Paul Carus, who also arranged the English translation\nand publication of many of Mach\u2019s works.  In\n1906, Monistenbund, a monistic society, was formed with the\nintention of including everyone who believed that there was only one\nreality. Haeckel and Ostwald were active members and tried without\nsuccess to bring in Mach with an offer of the presidency in 1912. Mach\nwrote back:\n\n\nThere are as many different monisms as there are people in it.\nMonism is provisionally a goal, after which we all strive, but\nis scarcely anything fixed or sufficient \u2026 It seems to me\n\u2026 ludicrous to found a kind of religious sect, while\nrefusing to consider philosophical questions [as to its\nnature]. But this is not so terribly important in so far as the\nmovement is limited to a small circle of intellectuals. But if it\nexpands more widely, then it will probably let loose a kind of\ncounterreformation for which I definitely have no sympathy.\n[Blackmore 1972: 193\u20134]\n\n\n4. Philosophy of Science\n4.1 Historical Critique\n\n\nMach wrote a number of widely read science history texts; in a sense\nthey are archaeologies of science, digging at the past to critically\nelucidate the present. Machian history can also be seen in the context\nof German nineteenth century thought; Hegel, David Strauss, Nietzsche,\nand Marx all offered historical frameworks for their various\nsocial-philosophical positions. They also saw their own critiques as\nplaying a crucial role in the new order that was to follow.  That is,\neach of their works placed itself at the juncture of history, where\ntheir writing self-consciously was to influence the next stage that it\nhad predicted. Certainly d\u2019Alembert, Herschel, Whewell, and Mill had\nwritten histories of science before Mach, but it was Mach who wrote\ncritical history in the above sense.  The interesting aspect of Mach\u2019s\ncritique was that it actually had an effect upon science. Science\nof Mechanics deserves mention in the history of physics.\n4.2 Biological Origins of Science\n\n\nMach puts science on a continuum with earlier human activity, in\nfact with earlier animal activity. What began as simple\nadaptations that allowed instinctive responses to immediate conditions,\ngradually evolved into ever more complex capacities for\nresponse. Gradually life acquired memory and thus an\nawareness of a wider field of spatial-temporal relations than is\npresent immediately to the senses. Memory then grew beyond\nindividual memory and became communicated culturally. Science is\na direct outgrowth of this deep natural process:\n\n\nLower animals living under simple, constant and favorable conditions\nadapt themselves to immediate circumstances through their innate\nreflexes.  This usually suffices to maintain individuals and species\nfor a suitable period.  An animal can withstand more intricate and\nless stable conditions only if it can adapt to a wider range of\nspatial and temporal surroundings.  This requires a farsightedness in\nspace and time which is met first by more perfect sense organs, and\nwith mounting demands by a development in the life of the imagination.\nIndeed an organism that possesses memory has wider spatial and\ntemporal surroundings in its mental field of vision than it could\nreach through its senses.  It perceives, as it were, even those\nregions that adjoin the directly visible, seeing the approach of prey\nor foe before any sense organ announces them.  What guarantees to\nprimitive man a measure of advantage over his animal fellows is\ndoubtless only the strength of his individual memory, which is\ngradually reinforced by the communicated memory of forebears and\ntribe.  Likewise, what essentially marks progress in civilization is\nthat noticeably wider regions of space and time are drawn within the\nscope of human attention.  With the partial relief that a rising\ncivilization affords, to begin with through division of labor,\ndevelopment of trades and so on, the individual\u2019s life is focused on a\nsmaller range of facts and gains in strength, while that of society as\na whole does not lose in scope.  Gradually the activity of thinking\nthus invigorated may itself become a calling.  Scientific thought\narises out of popular thought, and so completes the continuous series\nof biological development that begins with the first simple\nmanifestations of life.\u2026. Indeed, the formation of scientific\nhypotheses is merely a further degree of development of instinctive\nand primitive thought, and all the transitions between them can be\ndemonstrated. [KE: 171]\n\n\nIn an article to which Mach often refers, he writes: \u201cHere I\nwish simply to consider the growth of natural knowledge in the\nlight of the theory of evolution. For knowledge, too, is a\nproduct of organic nature. And although ideas, as such, do\nnot comport themselves in all respects like independent organic\nindividuals, and although violent comparisons should be avoided, still\nif Darwin reasoned rightly, the general imprint of evolution and\ntransformation must be noticeable in ideas also.\u201d [PL:\n218] And later, \u201cWe are prepared, thus, to regard ourselves and\nevery one of our ideas as a product and a subject of universal\nevolution; and in this way we shall advance sturdily and unimpeded\nalong the paths which the future will throw open to us.\u201d\n[PL: 233]\n4.3 Biological Purpose of Science\n\n\nOnce science is placed within an evolutionary context, Mach\u2019s\nteleological views of evolution (see section 3.4) become significant\nfor his philosophy of science. The developmental processes of\nevolution have given rise to this complex human activity we call\nscience, which now itself is participating in the processes of\nevolution. Just as the eye, for instance, has evolved to better\naid us in adapting to a greater variety of landscapes, so science has\nevolved to better aid us in adapting to the world:\n\n\nScience apparently grew out of biological and cultural development\nas its most superfluous offshoot. However, today we can hardly\ndoubt that it has developed into the factor that is biologically and\nculturally the most beneficial. Science has taken over the task\nof replacing tentative and unconscious adaptation by a faster variety\nthat is fully conscious and methodical. [KE: 361]\n\n\n\n\nScience is both an outcome of this process (it has\nbiological roots), and also now is part of this process (it\nhas a biological function continuous with other evolutionary\nprocesses). Leaves, hearts, brains, eyes, and science are on a\ncontinuum in as much as they arose out of adaptive processes and now\nserve the biological function of survival and further adaptation.\n\n\nMan is governed by the struggle for self preservation: his\nwhole activity is in its service, and only achieves with richer\nresources, what the reflexes accomplish in the lower organisms under\nsimpler conditions of life. Every recollection, every idea, every\npiece of knowledge has a value originally only in so far as it directly\nfurthers man in the direction indicated. [PH: 336]\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that Mach does not argue or provide evidence for\nthis evolutionary view of science; he seems rather to adopt it from\nideas that were being circulated in the later half of the nineteenth\ncentury.  Nonetheless, references to a deep evolutionary perspective\npermeate his writings.  For instance:\n\nThe biological task of science is to provide the fully developed\nhuman with as perfect a means of orientating himself as possible.\nNo other scientific ideal can be realized, and any other must be\nmeaningless. [AS: 37]\nAnd also:\n\n\nThe adaptation of thoughts to facts, accordingly, is the aim of all\nscientific research. In this, science only deliberately and\nconsciously pursues what in daily life goes on unnoticed and of its own\naccord. [AS: 316]\n\nThis evolutionary perspective even plays a critical role in his\nunderstanding of physics.  For instance, in his famous exchange with\nPlanck (see 5.3), Mach repeatedly refers to his biologico-economical\ntheory of knowledge as an important part of view of the physical\nworld.\n4.4 Economy and Unity of Science\n\n\nOne and the same view underlies both my epistemological-physical\nwritings and my present attempt to deal with the physiology of the\nsenses \u2014 the view, namely, that all metaphysical elements are to\nbe eliminated as superfluous and as destructive of the economy of\nscience. [AS: xxxviii]\n\n\nThe idea of an economy of nature dates back at least to Linnaeus, is\npresent throughout nineteenth century evolutionary ideas, and finds\nanother home in Mach. Nature is an organized and frugal\nsystem. Excess exists only in a vestigial sense; everything has\nits place. For Darwin, the economy of nature had a ready explanation in\nnatural selection, and the non-economical aspects of nature, such as\nvestigial organs, took on great significance. A logic of biology\ntook hold: where once economy was an observed feature of nature,\nit now became a necessary feature. Even the apparent\nnon-economical aspects were ultimately economical. Where once\neconomy required explanation, it now became the explanation. A\nphenomenon of nature turned into a force of nature. As is typical\nfor Mach, widely accepted biological principles become uncritically\nheld cornerstones of his epistemology.\n\n\nOf course, the metaphor of economy is also used in economics.\nAccording to Mach\u2019s own recollections of his intellectual\ndevelopment in a 1910 essay, \u201cThe Guiding Principles of My\nScientific Theory,\u201d he first understood science as\n\u2018okonomisch\u2019 in 1864, through discussions with his\nfriend E. Hermann, a political economist. In the same passage,\nMach proceeds to note that he was well prepared for this idea through\nhis biological background, and in fact the two combined to form what\nbecame his \u2018biological-economical theory of knowledge\u2019.\n[Mach 1910: 30\u201331]\n\n\nThe purpose of science is to give the most economical description of\nnature as possible, because science is to provide conceptions which can\nhelp us better orient ourselves to our world, and if science is\nuneconomical then it is useless in this regard. Put another way,\nMach\u2019s reason for insisting that economy must be a guiding\nprinciple in accepting or rejecting a theory is that uneconomical\ntheories cannot fulfill their biological function, which, as we have\nseen previously, he insists is (in a descriptive sense) the function of\nscience. The biological purpose of science is the improvement or\nthe better adaptation of memory in service of the organism\u2019s\ndevelopment:\n\n\nThe aim of scientific economy is to provide us with a picture of the\nworld as complete as possible \u2014 connected, unitary, calm and not\nmaterially disturbed by new occurrences: in short a world picture\nof the greatest possible stability. The nearer science approaches\nthis aim, the more capable will it be of controlling the disturbances\nof practical life, and thus serving the purpose out of which its\nfirst germs were developed. [PH: 336, italics\nadded]\n\n\nDisturbances in environments cause maladaptations; progressive\nadaptation only has meaning in reference to that which is stable.\nScience must be economical so that a stable basis for our orientation\ncan be built up, and this leads to a crucial point: as science\nencompasses more and more of the world, and as these theories work\nthemselves into our unconscious memory, more and more of the world\nbecomes part of our pre-existing cognitive structure. That is, the role\nof science is to improve our orientation to the world.\n\n\nLet us look in depth at a discussion of these issues occurring in\nScience and Mechanics in a chapter entitled \u201cThe Economy\nof Science.\u201d The section occurs toward the end of the book,\nand begins: \u201cIt is the object of science to replace, or\nsave experiences, by the reproduction and anticipation of\nfacts in thought. Memory is handier than experience, and often\nanswers the same purpose.\u201d [SM: 577] The\neconomical role of science is to allow us to understand and react to\nnature prior to experience; just as a newborn chicken knows what to do\nas soon as it is hatched due to its accumulated memory (it\ndoesn\u2019t need to learn on its own as the learning has already been\ndone by its ancestors), so we now learn from science how to anticipate\nthe world. Our memory encompasses more and more of the world,\nthus allowing better and better orientation.\n\n\nThe drive for economy is itself a biological instinct, which science\nmust thus also fulfill. In a larger sense, economy is tied to the\ninnate tendency toward survival or search for better orientation\ndiscussed earlier. Evolution is guided by these principles; life\nas a product of evolution has a tendency toward these principles, and\nwe as humans have these tendencies hard-wired into us\u2014even to the\npoint that our very conception of self-existence arises out of it; in\nAnalysis of Sensations, the ego is described as arising from\nan \u201cideal mental economical unity.\u201d [AS: 22]\n\n\nAn important application of this idea of economy occurs when two\ntheories, formerly separate, come in contact. For Mach this is a\ncentral concern: he is driven to unify psychology and\nphysics. At issue here is the economical requirement of needing a\nsingle orientating perspective: \u201cBut anyone who has in mind\nthe gathering up of the sciences into a single whole, has to look for a\nconception to which he can hold in every department of\nscience.\u201d [AS: 312] When theories come in\ncontact with each other, adaptation of one to the other must take\nplace: \u201cEpistemological criticism [is not a problem for the\nphysicist]. But when it is a question of bringing into connection\ntwo adjacent departments, each of which has been developed in its\nspecial way, the connection cannot be effected by means of the limited\nconceptions of a narrow special department. By means of more\ngeneral considerations, conceptions have to be created which shall be\nadequate for the wider domain.\u201d [AS: 313] It is\nuneconomical to have one theory for physics and another for psychology;\nthe mind demands that the two be brought together. Attempts at\nsuch mutual adaptation have so far been failures and Mach hopes that\nhis ideas can facilitate this:\n\n\nTo the physicist, qua physicist, the idea of \u201cbody\u201d\n\u2026 [assists in] a real facilitation of view, and is not the cause\nof disturbance\u2026. When, however, physics and psychology meet,\nthe ideas held in the one domain prove to be untenable in the\nother. From the attempt at mutual adaptation arise the various\natomic and monadistic theories \u2014 which, however, never attain\ntheir end. If we regard sensations, in the sense above defined\n(p. 13), as the elements of the world, the problems referred to appear\nto be disposed of in all essentials, and the first and most important\nadaptation to be consequently effected. This fundamental view\n(without any pretension to being a philosophy for all eternity) can at\npresent be adhered to in all fields of experience \u2026\n[AS: 32]\n\n\nThe inherent non-metaphysical unity of the physical and psychical is\nnot concocted, rather the disunity is what is artificial.\nMach\u2019s ideas on the unity of science, then, arise out of his\nbio-economical model of science.\n4.5 Nature of Scientific Change and Progress\n\n\nFinally, Mach can be seen as the precursor of what is today one of the\nmajor epistemological metaphors of scientific change. Mach offers a\nselectionist account of group-level change consisting of selection\nupon naturally produced variation, passed on through processes of\nheredity. As with Darwinian evolution, scientific variation itself is\nnot directed. Emphasizing the importance of natural variation, Mach\nhad a Feyerabendian tolerance of nonscientific beliefs\u2014the\nfamiliar point being that it is better to tolerate some error than risk\nlosing variation which might yield fruit later. As an indication of\nvariation\u2019s importance, several chapters in his various books are\ndirected almost entirely to this subject.  Variation is not something\nwhich we consciously produce, but rather something which happens by\naccident.\n\n\nThe mind is not able to come up with new ideas on its own, that is,\nit is unable to direct creativity. Thus, variation is not\ndirected, but science relies on fantasy, chance, luck, etc., for\nproduction of its ideas. Once produced, scientists choose those\nideas which best fit the facts. Mach also comments on the debates\nover whether reasoning, inductive or deductive, can produce knowledge,\narguing that reasoning cannot by itself produce knowledge, but rather\ncan only operate on existing variation: \u201cThus syllogism and\ninduction do not create new knowledge, but merely make sure that there\nis no contradiction between our various insights and show clearly how\nthese are connected, and lead our attention to different sides of some\nparticular insight, teaching us to recognize it in different\nforms. Obviously, then, the genuine source from which the\nenquirer gains knowledge must lie elsewhere.\u201d [KE:\n231]\n\n\nAlthough the mind cannot direct the creation of ideas, it can direct\nthe selection of them. Selection occurs when the\nscientists choose the theories, out of the pool of available variation,\nwhich best fit the data and other pre-existing ideas. It is also\nworth noting that Mach talks of the tendency for resistance to change\nas being both necessary and problematic for science. Mach was not\nonly one of the founders of Gestalt Theory, but also applied its core\nconcepts to the process of science. Packaged together with his use of\nhistory to elucidate science, he anticipates Kuhn\u2019s ideas on\nscientific change and progressive rationality.\n5. Physics\n\n\nJust as the early Mach was influenced by the revolutions in\npsychology and biology, the mature Mach was deeply involved in the\nrevolutions in physics, though remaining a critic of the new physics\njust as much as he had been of the old. Both Planck and Einstein\npaid their homage to the person who created a culture of critique\nwithin which they developed their ideas. They also came to\ncriticize what they saw as his stubborn refusal to accept their new\nideas.\n\n\nTo twentieth philosophy, Mach is best known as a positivist who\ninfluenced Logical Positivism, a philosopher of physics who influenced\nEinstein, and an empiricist who denied the reality of atoms. None of\nthis is incorrect, but to understand Mach as limited to physics is a\nhuge mistake. Mach\u2019s influence upon physics and its philosophy was\nenormous; the mistake has been to not understand the roots of Mach\u2019s\nideas, a mistake which took place early in the twentieth century as a\nnew brand of positivism/empiricism entered the scene (one which turned\naway from the life sciences as the scientific driving force of\npositivist epistemology and focused on the new developments in the\nfoundations of physics and logic). This encyclopedia has several\nentries on the history and philosophy of physics (see links below)\nwhich detail Mach\u2019s ideas, contributions, and influences (in\nparticular, his famous critique of Newtonian Absolute Space and Time,\nas well as his relationship to Einstein). What follows is a placement\nof his ideas within the context of his larger thought.\n5.1 Space\n\n\nMach perhaps writes more about space than any single other topic;\nthe Analysis of Sensations is dominated by discussions about\nit (Chapters 6 to 10 are devoted, more or less, exclusively to it) as\nis Space and Geometry. His Science of Mechanics\ncontains his famous analysis of absolute space.  The starting point of\nMach\u2019s thought is that physiological space is different\nfrom geometrical space. The idea of physiological space was\nnot new with Mach; apparently initiated by M\u00fcller, it was\ndiscussed by both Helmholtz and Hering.  Physiological space is the\nspace constructed by our cognitive structure. It is not something we\nintentionally create, but rather it is a product of unconscious\nadaptation, and as such, may be a source of a priori\ntruths. Geometrical space, on the other hand, is an intellectual\nconstruction, \u201creached for the most part by purposeful\nexperience.\u201d [SG: 5] While physiological space is\ncompletely psychological, geometrical space is an abstraction on\nphysiological space. Neither is an \u2018objective\u2019 or\n\u2018absolute\u2019 space.\n\n\nWhereas geometrical space is unbounded, infinite, and homogeneous (at\nleast in its Euclidean form), physiological space is highly bounded,\nfinite, and non-uniform. Geometrical space is detached from our\nemotional psyche, but physiological space is intertwined with basic\nemotions: a tiger nearby in physiological space brings about different\nemotions than a tiger far away in physiological space. Similarly,\nupness and downness, rightness and leftness are not just abstract\ndirections but have physiological, and thus psychological\nmeaning. When objects in physiological space are moved, their (apparent)size\nchanges (similarly, when we move, the size of objects in physiological\nspace also changes).  And, importantly, physiological space does not,\nat least in its origins, have a metric. The origins of physiological\nspace are in unconscious biological need, whereas the origins of\ngeometrical space are in physiological space and intellectual\ndevelopment.\n5.2 Measurement\n\n\nThis brings us to the problem of measurement. Normally\nwhen we measure an interval we believe we are indeed measuring space or\ntime. However, measurement relies upon comparison.\nThis was important for Mach: we do not measure \u2018space\u2019, but\nrather we compare our spatial sensations. All measurement\nrequires the use of a standard, and since any standard we pick is of\nthe same nature as the thing we are measuring, we do not truly measure\nanything (if by this we mean an absolute measurement):\n\n\nBut we do not measure mere space; we require a material standard of\nmeasurement, and with this the whole system of manifold sensations is\nbrought back again. It is only intuitional sense-presentations that can\nlead to the formulation of the equations of physics, and it is\nprecisely in such presentations that the interpretation of these\nequations consists. Thus, though the equations only contain\nspatial numerical measurements, these measurements, also, are merely\nthe ordering principle which tells us out of what members of the series\nof sensational elements we have to construct our picture of the\nworld. [AS: 343]\n\n\nWhen we measure the spatial dimensions of an object, we are comparing\nit to an agreed upon standard. Ultimately all standards must have\ntheir root in physiological comparison. In this way Mach tries to\nbring physics back into psychology. Physics is based upon\nmeasurements, but measurements are ultimately physiological\ncomparisons. According to Mach, physics can never escape its\nbiological origins. Planck and Einstein accepted Mach\u2019s critique of\nthe old physics, that it was under the spell of concepts which were\nderivative of unreflective development, but rejected Mach\u2019s claim that\nphysics was stuck, so to speak, in psychology.\n5.3 Anti-Atomism\n\n\n\u2026 the biological-economical interpretation of the cognitive\nprocess can perfectly well co-exist on peaceable, and indeed on\nfriendly, terms with that of present-day physics. The only real\npoint of difference which has so far come to light concerns the belief\nin the reality of atoms. Here again, Planck can hardly find words\ndegrading enough for such wrong headedness \u2026. After exhorting\nthe reader, with Christian charity, to respect his opponent, P. brands\nme, in the well-known biblical words, as a \u201cfalse\nprophet.\u201d It appears that the physicists are on the way to\nfounding a church; they are already using a church\u2019s traditional\nweapons. To this I answer simply: \u201cIf belief in the\nreality of atoms is so important to you, I cut myself off from the\nphysicist\u2019s mode of thinking, I do not wish to be a true\nphysicist, I renounce all scientific respect\u2014in short: I\ndecline with thanks the communion of the faithful. I prefer\nfreedom of thought.\u201d [\u201cThe Guiding Principles of My Scientific\nTheory of Knowledge and Its Reception by My\nContemporaries.\u201d 37\u201338]\n\n\nMach\u2019s opposition to atomism has become one of his best known\nlegacies, with Mach seen as an anti-realist about unobservable\nentities. While anti-realist arguments can indeed be found in\nMach, their origins lie not in philosophical skepticism but in his\nbio-psychological view of science. Furthermore, his\nconcerns about atoms were often specific to the various competing\ntheories of the time. It should be noted that the issue of\natomism was a central scientific controversy of this period; there were\na variety of theories of atoms being put forward as well as varieties\nof alternatives. In his Principles of the Theory of\nHeat, Mach aligned himself with a phenomenological approach to\nthermodynamics\u2014a temporarily fruitful research program that avoided\nthe problems of positing theoretical causal entities.\nMach\u2019s experimental research was not in this area, but at stake\nwas not just the reality of atoms but an understanding of\nscience. Mach\u2019s attitude toward atoms was an outgrowth of a\nview of science.\n\n\nHe became embroiled in a long-standing dispute with Boltzmann,\npropounder of the kinetic theory of gasses. Boltzmann and Mach\nended up agreeing in essence: if atomic theory was fruitful it should\nbe used, but adopted what today might be considered an\nanti-metaphysical stance toward a theory that was still largely\nunsubstantiated. It is generally agreed that it was not until\n1905 with Einstein\u2019s study of Brownian motion that the kinetic\ntheory of molecules found full verification.\n\n\nMach\u2019s views on atomism are most clearly presented in an\nexchange with Planck. In 1909 Planck wrote an essay \u201cThe\nUnity of the Physical World-Picture\u201d, which contained a severe\ncriticism of Mach\u2019s philosophy. Mach replied in 1910, with\n\u201cThe Guiding Principles of My Scientific Theory of Knowledge and\nIts Reception by My Contemporaries.\u201d Planck responded in\n1910 with \u201cOn Mach\u2019s Theory of Physical Knowledge: A\nReply.\u201d\n\n\nAt issue were differences on how to make science free of human\nsubjectivity, and how to achieve a unified science. Planck [1909]\nargues that while we once defined heat according to sensations, the\nstudy of heat has gone beyond this, now being under the purview of\nelectrodynamics and kinetic theory; similarly, tones and color are now\nunderstood as frequencies or wavelengths. Although physics had\nits beginnings in the analysis of sense impressions, its current\nsuccess is due to removing these anthropomorphic elements. Planck\nformulates a vision of a human-independent science in reaction to\nMach\u2019s claim that science is human-dependent.\n\n\nPlanck thought that physics can go beyond psychological dependency\nby basing itself on psychologically independent universal\nconstants: \u201cthe constants appearing in the laws of heat\nradiation in free ether, like the constants of gravity, have a\nuniversal character and involve no reference to any special substance\nor any special body\u201d [1909]. They are human-independent in a way\nthat a unit like a centimeter is not. These constants can be used\nto \u201cestablish units of length, time, volume and temperature,\nwhich must of necessity retain their meaning for all time and for all\ncultures, even extra-terrestrial and extra-human ones\u201d\n[1909].\n\n\nMach\u2019s response is one of his last statements of position:\n\n\nI have no doubt that if, somewhere in the universe a creature\norganized like ourselves could make observations \u2026 it would\nperceive a universe working similarly to that we ourselves describe\n\u2026. As for the reality of atoms: I have no doubt that if\natomic theory corresponds to the reality given by the senses, the\nconclusions drawn from it will also bear some relation to the facts\n\u2014 though what relation remains unclear. The distance from\nthe glass of the first dark ring in reflected light corresponds to\none-half of the period of Newton\u2019s \u2018fits\u2019, but to one\nquarter of Young and Fresnel\u2019s \u2018wavelength\u2019.\nThe findings of atomic theory, likewise, can undergo a variety of\nconvenient reinterpretations, even if we are in no great hurry to take\nthem for realities.
