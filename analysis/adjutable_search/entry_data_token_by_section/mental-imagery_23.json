    "main_text": "Mental imagery in art || Mental imagery in music\n5.2 Mental imagery in music\n\nMental imagery also plays a crucial role in our appreciation of music,\nprimarily as a result of the importance of musical expectations, which\nare a form of auditory mental imagery. Expectations play a crucial\nrole in our engagement with music (and art in general). When we are\nlistening to a song, even when we hear it for the first time, we have\nsome expectations of how it will continue. And when it is a tune we\nare familiar with, this expectation can be quite strong (and easy to\nstudy experimentally). When we hear Ta-Ta-Ta at the beginning of the\nfirst movement of Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony in C\nminor, Op. 67 (1808), we will strongly anticipate the closing Taaam of\nthe Ta-Ta-Ta-Taaaam. Much of our expectations are fairly\nindeterminate: when we are listening to a musical piece we have never\nheard before, we will still have some expectations of how a tune will\ncontinue, but we don\u2019t know what exactly will happen. We can\nrule out that the violin glissando will continue with the sounds of a\nbeeping alarm clock (unless it\u2019s a really avant-garde\npiece\u2026), but we can\u2019t predict with great certainty how\nexactly it will continue. Our expectations are malleable and dynamic:\nthey change as we listen to the piece.\n\nExpectations are mental states that are about how the musical piece\nwill unfold. So they are future-directed mental states. But this\nleaves open just what kind of mental states they are \u2013 how they\nare structured, how they represent this upcoming future event and so\non (see Judge and Nanay 2021 for an overview of the options and the\nhistory of this question). At least some forms of expectations in fact\ncount as mental imagery. And musical expectations (of the kind\ninvolved in examples like the Ta-Ta-Ta-Taaaam) count as auditory\ntemporal mental imagery: they are auditory representations that result\nfrom perceptual processes that are not directly triggered by the\nauditory input. The listener forms mental imagery of the fourth note\n(\u2018Taaam\u2019) on the basis of the experience of the first\nthree (\u2018Ta-Ta-Ta\u2019) (there is a lot of empirical evidence\nthat this is in fact what happens \u2013 see Yokosawa et al. 2013,\nKraemer et al. 2005, Zatorre and Halpern 2005, Herholz et al. 2012,\nLeaver et al. 2009). This mental imagery may or may not be conscious.\nBut if the actual \u2018Taaaam\u2019 diverges from the way our\nmental imagery represents it (if it is delayed, or altered in pitch or\ntimbre for example), we notice this divergence and experience as\nsalient as a result of the mismatch between the experience and\nthe mental imagery that preceded it.\n\nThe Ta-Ta-Ta-Taaam example is a bit simplified, so here is a real-life\nand very evocative case study, an installation by the British artist,\nKatie Peterson. The installation is an empty room with a grand piano\nin it, which plays automatically. It plays a truncated version of\nBeethoven\u2019s Moonlight Sonata. The title of the installation is\n\u2018Earth-Moon-Earth (Moonlight Sonata Reflected From The\nSurface of The Moon\u2019 (2007). Earth-Moon-Earth is a form of\ntransmission (between two locations on Earth), where Morse codes are\nbeamed up the moon and they are reflected back to earth. While this is\nan efficient way of communicating between two far-away (Earth-based)\nlocations, some information is inevitably lost (mainly because some of\nthe light does not get reflected back but it is absorbed in the\nMoon\u2019s craters). In \u2018Earth-Moon-Earth (Moonlight\nSonata Reflected From The Surface of The Moon\u2019 (2007) the\npiano plays the notes that did get through the Earth-Moon-Earth\ntransmission system, which is most of the notes, but some notes are\nskipped. Listening to the music the piano plays in this installation,\nif you know the piece, your auditory mental imagery is constantly\nactive, filling in the gaps where the notes are skipped.\n",
