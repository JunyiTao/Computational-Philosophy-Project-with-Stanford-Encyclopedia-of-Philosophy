    "main_text": "Civic Humanism and Republicanism\n2. Civic Humanism and Republicanism\n\nAs previously suggested, both Baron and Garin generally regarded civic\nhumanism as an equivalent to or as a particular variant of\nrepublicanism, meaning a conception of politics in which government is\nin principle the common business of the citizens. The\n\u201ccity\u201d provides the environment\u2014a public\nspace\u2014for human fulfillment. More specifically, they appear to\nbelieve that civic humanism derives from classical republicanism of\nsome variety ascribed to Aristotle, Cicero, and Polybius among others\n(although knowledge of Book VI of the latter\u2019s\nHistories before the beginning of the sixteenth century is\ndisputed [Nederman 2016; Hankins 2016; Monfasani 2016]). Civic\nhumanism is linked in principle to a classical educational program\nthat goes beyond the formative capacity of participatory citizenship\nitself and involves the conscious revival of ancient ideals.\nRepublican candor, simplicity of manner, opposition to ostentation,\nluxury and lucre, are common, though not universal, republican themes.\nCivic humanists, it is said, promote republican ideals responding to\nthe fragility of the republic and the need to provide against its\ncorruption and decay with the passage of time.\n\nAccording to Baron, numerous civic humanist theorists emphasized that\nthe republic requires widespread civic virtue, i.e., the active\nengagement of citizens united by a concern for the common good. The\nvirtues of citizenship are in turn developed and enhanced by being\nexercised in upholding republican political and legal institutions and\nmaking them work by being involved in their operation. Republican life\nis then thought to be formative of the public spirit on which it\nrests. Republican freedom depends on constant civic activity. The\npolity is taken to cohere by means of the common acceptance of\nstandards of justice that are more than procedural rules. The purpose\nof the commonwealth is the realization of human potentiality,\nencouraging the flowering of all forms of creativity and ingenuity\ninsofar as they contribute to public welfare. The republic is the\nnecessary medium of self-realization, not merely the condition of\npossibility of private endeavors. There is a link furthermore between\nthe freedom of the citizen and the independence of the republic.\nCitizen armies and the right to bear arms are therefore common\npostulates of republican theory. Adherents to the \u201cBaron\nthesis\u201d use all of these confluences of civic humanism and\nrepublicanism to support their contention that the two positions are\ninseparable.\n\nOne important extension of Baron\u2019s position has been proposed by\nJohn Pocock (1975). Pocock takes Renaissance civic humanism to be an\nestimable manifestation of republican and patriotic collective\nsentiment. For Pocock as well as Baron, civic humanism must be\nconsidered the response to a crisis amounting to what Machiavelli\nwould call an occasione, a moment of disorder that gives\nscope to the formative activity of a new beginning that nevertheless\nlooks to the past in order to guide its future. The dilemma faced by\nFlorentine civic humanists, according to Pocock, was to fit the idea\nof an Aristotelian polis within the framework of a Christian\nunderstanding of time. One answer to the experience of disorder was\nthe explicitly millenarian exaltation of the leader of\nFlorence\u2019s republic from 1494 to 1498, the Dominican preacher\nGirolamo Savonarola. In Pocock\u2019s view, civic humanism provided a\nsecular alternative to Savanarola\u2019s prophetic republicanism, in\nthe form of a revived Aristotelian \u201cscience of virtue\u201d as\nthe means of overcoming the republic\u2019s temporal finitude. Given\ndoubts that have been raised with regard to the philosophical depth of\nthe supposed Aristotelianism of the Florentine humanists, another\nrecent scholar of civic humanism, Quentin Skinner has, as an\nalternative, stressed its Roman rather than Hellenic antecedents\n(Bock, Skinner, & Viroli 1990: 121\u2013141). This is not just a\nmatter of identifying sources. Skinner\u2019s revised position means\nrather that in his view, civic humanism advocated active citizenship\nas a means to liberty from foreign and domestic domination, rather\nthan as a self-fulfilling human end. In more recent times, Skinner has\nshifted his position from an historical claim to an entirely\nphilosophical one, in line with the purely theoretical conception of\nrepublicanism discussed above (e.g., Skinner 1998).\n\nIronically, in Pocock\u2019s adaptation of Baron\u2019s thesis,\nvirtue is opposed to property, and it is the urban, bourgeois\nentrepreneurs and the chancery of the modernizing state, the very\ncreators of civic humanism in Baron\u2019s mind, that reside on the\nwrong side of the fence. Baron\u2019s civic humanists advocated a\ndeparture from the medieval ideals of contemplation and asceticism to\nassert an active life that included trade and profit (Jurdjevic 2001:\n727\u2013728). In the Pocockean version of republicanism, civic\nvirtue is opposed to a vision of citizenship that embraces the private\npursuit of gain. This kind of virtuous polity cannot, however, be\nFlorence\u2014and certainly not Baron\u2019s Florence\u2014the\npalazzi of which were built with the profits of banking,\nmanufacturing, international trade, and interest on the city\u2019s\npublic debt. Pocock\u2019s rearward glance to Aristotle (and even\nSkinner\u2019s to Rome) did not take into account the historical\nrealities of the Renaissance Italian cities, Florence in\nparticular.\n",
