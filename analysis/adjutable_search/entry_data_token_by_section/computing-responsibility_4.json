    "main_text": "Can computers be moral agents?\n2. Can computers be moral agents?\n\nMoral responsibility is generally attributed to moral agents and, at\nleast in Western philosophical traditions, moral agency has been a\nconcept exclusively reserved for human beings (Johnson 2001; Doorn and\nvan de Poel 2012). Unlike animals or natural disasters, human beings\nin these traditions can be the originators of morally significant\nactions, as they can freely choose to act in one way rather than\nanother way and deliberate about the consequences of this choice. And,\nalthough some people are inclined to anthropomorphize computers and\ntreat them as if they were moral agents (Reeves and Nass 1996; Nass\nand Moon 2000; Rosenthal-von der P\u00fctten 2013), most\nphilosophers agree that current computer technologies should not be\ncalled moral agents, if that would mean that they could be held\nmorally responsible. However, the limitations of traditional ethical\nvocabularies in thinking about the moral dimensions of computing have\nled some authors to rethink the concept of moral agency. It should be\nnoted that some authors have also argued for a reconsideration of\nWestern philosophical anthropocentric conceptions of moral patiency,\nin particular in regard to the question concerning the moral standing\nof artificial agents or robots (Floridi 2016, Gunkel 2020,\nCoeckelbergh 2020). The following will nevertheless focus on\nmoral agency as these reflections on moral patiency tend to not\naddress the challenges to moral responsibility.\n",
