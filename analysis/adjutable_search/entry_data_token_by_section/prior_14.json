    "main_text": "Life and Philosophical Development || Back to England\n3.7 Back to England\n\n\nIn 1954, Gilbert Ryle visited New Zealand. He brought Prior an\ninvitation to visit Oxford and deliver the John Locke lectures. Prior\narranged a twelve month leave of absence from Canterbury and arrived in\nOxford at the beginning of 1956. Rather quickly a small group began to\nform around him: Ivo Thomas, John Lemmon, Peter Geach. (His meetings\nwith Prior were Lemmon\u2019s first introduction to modal logic.)\nHughes summarized the news arriving back home: \u2018this wild\ncolonial boy just hit Oxford and started to gather around him the main\npeople [interested in] logic, and he started to organise a lot of\nparties, almost, for the serious doing of logic\u2019. Prior kitted\nout his tiny rented apartment with a toyshop blackboard and held open\nhouse. On Mondays during Hilary and Trinity terms he lectured on modal\nlogic, his great passion, and on tense logic, his great invention. The\nlectures were published the following year, under the title Time\nand Modality.\n\n\nIn the summer break following the John Locke lectures, Prior\norganised a Logic Colloquium in Oxford. Logic was deeply out of fashion\nin 1950s Britain, and its practitioners were isolated and somewhat\ndemoralized. As Prior wrote shortly after the Colloquium, \u2018There\nare logicians in England and Ireland; but it must be admitted\nthat they are somewhat scattered, and so far as I could gather they had\nnever had any general get-together\u2019 (1956b: 186). Prior\u2019s\nColloquium brought together Lemmon, Thomas, Geach, M. Kneale, W.C.\nKneale, M.W. Dick, Lewy, Smiley, Bennett, Lejewski, Faris, Nidditch,\nCarew Meredith, David Meredith, and others. It was all a huge success,\nand the Colloquium became a regular fixture. Through his John Locke\nlectures, the Colloquium, and his numerous visits around the country,\nPrior helped to revitalise British logic. The group he left behind saw\nsimilarities between themselves and the close-knit group of researchers\nthat existed in Warsaw before 1939.\n\n\nIt was no doubt with mixed feelings that he returned to New Zealand.\nAfter twelve months of logical companionship on a grand scale, life at\nCanterbury was a lonely prospect. Seething with enthusiasm for logic,\nhe threw himself once more into a massive correspondence, but it could\nno longer satisfy him. Prior pined. When the offer arrived of a newly\nestablished second chair at the University of Manchester, he snatched\nit up. The Priors left New Zealand again in December 1958.\n",
