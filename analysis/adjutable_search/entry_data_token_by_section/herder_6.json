    "main_text": "Philosophy of Language, Interpretation, and Translation || Theory of Translation\n4.3 Theory of Translation\n\nHerder already in the Fragments of 1767\u20138 developed an\nimportant new theory of translation that subsequently went on to have\nan enormous and beneficial impact on both the theory and the practice\nof translation in Germany. The following are some of its key\ntheses:\n\nTranslation (like interpretation) faces a deep challenge due to the\nphenomenon of radical mental difference. It especially does so because\nof the deep differences in concepts that occur between different\nhistorical periods and cultures, and even to some extent between\nindividuals within a single period and culture.\n\nAs a result, translation is in many cases an extremely difficult\nundertaking.\n\nAgain as a result, translation commonly confronts a choice between two\npossible approaches: what Herder calls a \u201clax\u201d approach\n(i.e., one in which the language and thought of the target text are\nallowed to diverge rather freely from those of the source text) and an\n\u201caccommodating\u201d approach (i.e., one in which they are made\nto conform closely to those of the source text).\n\nHerder rejects the former approach. He does so largely because it\nfails to achieve the most widely accepted and fundamental goal of\ntranslation: semantic faithfulness.\n\nHe in particular rejects a certain rationale for it that Dryden and\nothers had advocated, namely, that a translation should provide\nthe work that the author would have written had his native\nlanguage not been the one he actually had but instead the target\nlanguage. Herder objects to this that due to the essential\ndependence of thought on language and the deep differences in the\nlatter, in cases such as that of translating Homer, for example, the\nauthor could not have written his work in the modern target\nlanguage.\n\nSo Herder urges that the translator should instead err in the other\ndirection, toward \u201caccommodating\u201d.\n\nBut how is this to be achieved?\n\nOne essential means to achieving it that Herder identifies is that the\ntranslator must have interpretive expertise. So Herder\nrequires this.\n\nAnother, much less obvious, means is a certain vitally important\ntechnique that Herder develops for overcoming conceptual discrepancies\nbetween the source language and the target language. That might seem\nsimply impossible (indeed, some more recent philosophers, such as\nDonald Davidson, have hastily assumed that it would be). But Herder,\ndrawing on his novel philosophy of language, finds a solution: Since\nmeanings or concepts are word-usages, in order to reproduce (or at\nleast optimally approximate) in the target language a concept from the\nsource language that the target language so far lacks, the translator\nshould take the closest corresponding word from the target language\nand \u201cbend\u201d its usage for the course of the translation in\nsuch a way as to make it mimic the usage of the source word. This\ntechnique essentially requires that the source word be translated\nuniformly across its multiple occurrences in a work (and also that the\nsingle target word chosen not be used to translate any other source\nwords). Such an approach is far from being common in translation\npractice, so far indeed that it is rarely found in translations.\nHowever, Herder scrupulously uses it in his own translations, as does\nan important tradition that has subsequently followed him in adopting\nit (including Schleiermacher, Franz Rosenzweig, and Martin Buber).\n\nHerder is well aware that using this \u201cbending\u201d approach\nwill inevitably make for translations that are more difficult to read\nthan those that can be produced by a more \u201clax\u201d method\n(e.g., by using multiple words in the target language to translate a\nsingle word in the source language). However, he considers this price\nwell worth paying in order to achieve maximal semantic accuracy.\n\nAnother key means that Herder adopts is to complement the goal of\nsemantic faithfulness with that of faithfulness to the musical\nform of a work (e.g., meter, rhyme, alliteration, and assonance).\nAs might be expected, his motives for doing this are partly\nextra-semantic: in particular, aesthetic fidelity, and fidelity to the\nexact expression of feelings that is effected by means of a literary\nwork\u2019s musical features. But they are also in part semantic: in\nhis view, musical form and semantic content are strictly inseparable,\nso that fully realizing even the goal of semantic faithfulness in fact\nrequires that a translation also be faithful to the work\u2019s\nmusical form. Why does he believe that musical form and semantic\ncontent are inseparable in this way? He has two main reasons: First,\nmusical forms often carry their own meanings (think, for example, of\nthe humorous and bawdy connotations of the meter/rhyme-scheme of a\nlimerick). Second, as was recently mentioned, Herder believes that\nmusical form is essential to an exact expression of feelings; but, as\nwe saw earlier, he also thinks that feelings are internal to meanings\n(this is part of the force of his quasi-empiricism in the philosophy\nof language); so reproducing a work\u2019s musical form in\ntranslation turns out to be essential even for accurately conveying\nthe meanings of its words and sentences in translation.\n\nIn addition to being necessary in order to achieve translation\u2019s\ntraditional fundamental goal of exactly reproducing meaning (as well\nas aesthetic fidelity and fidelity in the expression of feelings) as\nfully as possible, the more \u201caccommodating\u201d sort of\ntranslation that has been described is also necessary, in\nHerder\u2019s view, in order to achieve certain further important\ngoals. One of these lies in a potential that translation has for\nenriching the target language (both conceptually and in musical\nforms). Herder argues convincingly that whereas \u201clax\u201d\ntranslation forgoes this opportunity, \u201caccommodating\u201d\ntranslation capitalizes on it.\n\nAnother of these further goals lies in both expressing and cultivating\nin a translation\u2019s readers a cosmopolitan respect for the\nOther\u2014something that requires that the translation reproduce the\nOther\u2019s meanings and musical forms as accurately as\npossible.\n\nHerder holds that the preferred \u201caccommodating\u201d sort of\ntranslation demands that the translator be in a sense a\n\u201ccreative genius\u201d, i.e., skilled and creative enough to\nsatisfy the heavy demands that this sort of translation imposes on\nhim, in particular, skilled and creative enough to invent the new\nconceptual and musical forms in the target language that it\nrequires.\n\nDespite his commitment to the central importance of this sort of\ntranslation (largely, as we have seen, due to its necessity for\nachieving translation\u2019s traditional fundamental goal of\nfaithfully reproducing meaning), Herder is also in the end quite\nliberal about the forms that translation\u2014or interlinguistic\ntransfer more generally, including, for example, what he sometimes\ndistinguishes from \u201ctranslation\n[\u00dcbersetzung]\u201d proper as \u201cimitation\n[Nachbildung]\u201d or \u201crejuvenation\n[Verj\u00fcngung]\u201d\u2014can legitimately take. He\nallows that its possible forms are quite various, and that which one\nis most appropriate in a particular case will largely depend on the\nauthor or genre in question and on the translator\u2019s (or\ntransferer\u2019s) purposes.\n\nHerder\u2019s theory of translation (as just summarized), together\nwith his demonstration of its viability in practice, for example, in\nhis sample translations of Shakespeare in the Popular Songs,\nhad an enormous and beneficial impact on a whole generation of German\ntranslation theorists and practitioners\u2014including Johann\nHeinrich Voss (the great translator of Homer), August Wilhelm Schlegel\n(an important translation theorist and the great translator of\nShakespeare), Goethe (a significant theorist of translation), Wilhelm\nvon Humboldt (a significant theorist of translation and translator),\nand especially Schleiermacher (an important theorist of translation\nand Germany\u2019s great translator of the Platonic dialogues).\nHerder\u2019s principle of complementing semantic faithfulness with\nfaithfulness in the reproduction of musical form had an especially\npowerful impact on these successors. His principle of\n\u201cbending\u201d word-usages in order to cope with conceptual\nincommensurabilities was less widely followed, but was adopted by\nSchleiermacher among others. The currently predominant translation\ntheory, the \u201cforeignizing\u201d approach of Antoine Berman and Lawrence\nVenuti, ultimately derives from Herder and Schleiermacher, and is\nindeed less an improvement on their version than an impoverishment of\nit (especially concerning meaning).\n",
