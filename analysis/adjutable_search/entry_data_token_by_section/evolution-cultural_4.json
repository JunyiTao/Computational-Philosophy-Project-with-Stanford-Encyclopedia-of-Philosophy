    "main_text": "A Strong Analogy: Memes and Memetics\n3. A Strong Analogy: Memes and Memetics\n\nConsider again the theory of memetics. This theory, originally put\nforward by Richard Dawkins (1976), is perhaps the best-known attempt\nto apply evolutionary thinking to culture. That said, while it has\nenjoyed considerable popular attention, it has not become\nwell-established in scientific circles (although see Shennan 2008,\n2011 for significant work that takes the meme\u2019s-eye view).\n\nThe meme theory draws a strong analogy between evolution at the\ncultural level, and biological evolution. It begins with an abstract\ncharacterization of selection as a process requiring entities that\nreproduce, such that parents resemble offspring. It moves on to take\nthe more demanding view, popularized by Dawkins, that entities which\nhave the ability to make faithful copies of themselves\u2014so-called\n\u201creplicators\u201d\u2014are required to explain this\ntrans-generational resemblance. In standard biological models of\nevolution, it is assumed that genes are the relevant replicators.\nGenes make copies of themselves, and this ability explains why\noffspring organisms resemble their parents. If culture is to evolve,\nit therefore becomes necessary to find some cultural replicator that\nexplains cultural inheritance. Memes play this role. Dawkins gives a\nlist of some exemplary memes: \u201ctunes, ideas, catch-phrases,\nclothes fashions, ways of making pots or of building arches\u201d.\nNote that while it is sometimes assumed that all memes are ideas (and\nvice versa), Dawkins\u2019s list includes other types of thing, such\nas ways of making pots, which are techniques (see the entry on\n replication and reproduction).\n\nDawkins\u2019s claim is that ideas, for example, can be\nconceptualized as entities that hop from mind to mind, making copies\nof themselves as they go. On the face of things, this seems an\nattractive proposition. Just as genes make copies of themselves at\ndifferent rates according to their effects on the organisms that bear\nthem and on their local environments, so ideas make copies of\nthemselves at different rates according to their effects on the\norganisms that bear them and on their local environments. In a\ncommunity of scientists, for example, different hypotheses are\nentertained, and some come to be believed more widely than others. A\nhypothesis that begins in the mind of one or two scientists thereby\nspreads, until it is widely held in the research community. Another\nhypothesis quickly dies.\n\nWe can perhaps characterize the features that make some hypotheses\nlikely to spread, and others likely to perish. \u201cFit\u201d\nhypotheses may have predictive power, or simplicity, or they may\nintegrate well with existing bodies of theory. Note that what this\nexample shows is that taking the meme\u2019s-eye perspective does not\nliterally show that we are being manipulated by selfish cultural\nreplicators. One can describe scientific change as a struggle between\nselfish memes, but one can also describe just the same process in\nterms of scientists choosing to accept, or to reject, theories by\nreference to familiar criteria of explanatory power, theoretical\nelegance and so forth. It is only an incidental feature of the\nmetaphor of memetic selfishness that appears to deprive humans of\ncontrol over which ideas they do, and do not, accept.\n",
