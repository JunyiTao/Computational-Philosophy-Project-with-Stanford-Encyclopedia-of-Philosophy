    "main_text": "Alternative conceptions of computation || Pluralism\n6.5 Pluralism\nWe have surveyed various contrasting and sometimes overlapping\nconceptions of computation: classical computation, connectionist\ncomputation, neural computation, formal-syntactic computation,\ncontent-involving computation, information-processing computation,\nfunctional computation, structuralist computation, and mechanistic\ncomputation. Each conception yields a different form of\ncomputationalism. Each conception has its own strengths and\nweaknesses.  One might adopt a pluralistic stance that\nrecognizes distinct legitimate conceptions. Rather than elevate one\nconception above the others, pluralists happily employ whichever\nconception seems useful in a given explanatory context. Edelman (2008)\ntakes a pluralistic line, as does Chalmers (2012) in his most recent\ndiscussion.\nThe pluralistic line raises some natural questions. Can we provide\na general analysis that encompasses all or most types of computation?\nDo all computations share certain characteristic marks with one\nanother?  Are they perhaps instead united by something like family\nresemblance?  Deeper understanding of computation requires us to\ngrapple with these questions.\n",
