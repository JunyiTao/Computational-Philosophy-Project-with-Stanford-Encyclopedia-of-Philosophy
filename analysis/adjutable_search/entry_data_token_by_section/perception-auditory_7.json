    "main_text": "Varieties of Auditory Perception || Musical Listening\n4.1 Musical Listening\n\nMusical listening is a topic that bears on questions about the\nrelationship between hearing sounds and hearing sources. While the\nphilosophy of music has its own vast literature (see the entry on\n the philosophy of music),\n musical experience has not been used as extensively to explore\ngeneral philosophical questions about auditory perception. This\nsection discusses links that are relevant to advancing philosophical\nwork on auditory perception.\n4.1.1 Acousmatic Experience\n\nAn account of listening to pure or non-vocal music should capture the\naesthetic significance of musical listening. Appreciating music\nis appreciating sounds and sequences, arrangements, or structures of\nsounds. Thus, the temporal aspects of auditory experiences are\ncritical to appreciatively listening to music.\n\nOne might go further and hold that sounds are all that matters in\nmusic. In particular, some have argued that appreciatively listening\nto music demands listening in a way that abstracts from the\nenvironmental significance, and thus from the specific sources, of the\nsounds it includes (Scruton 1997, 2\u20133). Such acousmatic\nlistening involves experiencing sounds in a way that is\n\u201cdetached from the circumstances of their production,\u201d\nrather than \u201cas having a certain worldly cause\u201d (Hamilton\n2007, 58; see also Hamilton 2009). Listening to music and being\nreceptive to its aesthetically relevant features requires not\nlistening to violins, horns, or brushes on snare drums. It requires\nhearing sounds and grasping them in a way removed from their common\nsources. Hearing a high fidelity recording thus furnishes an\naesthetically identical musical experience despite having a speaker\ncone rather than a violin as source. \u201cThe acousmatic experience\nof sound is precisely what is exploited by the art of music\u201d\n(Scruton 1997, 3).\n\nThis suggests an intuitive difference between music and visual arts\nsuch as painting and sculpture. As Kivy (1991) explains, it is\ndifficult even with the most abstract paintings and sculptures to see\nthem in a way that takes them to be entirely formal or abstract. That\nis, it is difficult to avoid seeing pictures and sculptures as\nrepresentational. In contrast, it seems easier to listen attentively\nto the formal acoustical features of musical sounds, without being\ncompelled to think of what makes them.\n\nMusical listening thus may be thought to provide a prima facie\nargument against the claim that in hearing sounds one typically hears\nsound sources such as the strumming of guitars and bowing of violins.\nIf such \u201cinterested\u201d audition were the rule, musical\nlistening would be far more challenging.\n4.1.2 Acousmatic Listening as Attention to Sounds\n\nAcousmatic experience, however, may be a matter of attention.\nNothing prevents focusing one\u2019s attention on the sounds and\naudible qualities without attending to the instruments, acts, and\nevents that are their sources, even if each is auditorily available.\nThat musical listening requires effort and training supports the idea\nthat one can direct attention differently in auditory experience,\ndepending on one\u2019s interests. Caring for an infant and safely\ncrossing the street require attending to sound sources, while\nlistening with aesthetic appreciation to a symphony may require\nabstracting from the circumstances of its production, such as the\nfinger movements of the oboist. This response holds that musical\nlistening is a matter of auditorily attending in a certain way. It is\nattending to features of sounds themselves, but does not imply failing\nto hear sound sources.\n\nThe acousmatic thesis is a limited view about which aspects of the\nthings one can auditory experience are aesthetically significant.\nThese include audible aspects of sounds themselves, but exclude, for\nexample, other contents of auditory experience. However, room exists\nfor debate over the aesthetically significant aspects of what you hear\n(see Hamilton 2007, 2009). For example, one might argue that live\nperformances have aesthetic advantages over recordings because one\nhears the performance of the sounds and songs, rather than\ntheir reproduction by loudspeakers (cf. Mag Uidhir 2007).\nCircumstances of sound production, such as that skillful gestures\ngenerate a certain passage, or that a particularly rare wood accounts\nfor a violin\u2019s sounds, might be aesthetically relevant in a way\nthat outstrips the sounds, and some such features may be audible in\naddition to sounds. For instance, hearing the spatial characteristics\nof a performance may hold aesthetic significance beyond the tones and\nstructures admitted by traditional accounts of musical listening.\nComposers may even intend \u201cspatial gestures\u201d among aspects\nessential for the appreciation of a piece (see, e.g., Solomon 2007).\nTo imagine auditorily experiencing the spatial characteristics of\nmusic in a way entirely divorced from the environmental significance\nof the sounds is difficult. Appreciating the relationship between\nexperiences of sounds and of sources makes room for a view of the\naesthetic value of musical listening that is more liberal than\nacousmatic experience allows.\n4.2 Speech Perception\n4.2.1 Is Speech Special?\n\nSpeech perception presents uniquely difficult twists, and few\nphilosophers have confronted it directly (Appelbaum 1999, Trout 2001a,\nMatthen 2005, ch 9, and Remez and Trout 2009 are recent exceptions).\nSomething striking and qualitatively distinctive\u2014perhaps\nuniquely human\u2014seems to set the perception of speech apart from\nordinary hearing. The main philosophical issues about speech\nperception concern versions of the question, Is speech special? (See\nO\u2019Callaghan 2015 for a comprehensive review and discussion.)\n\nHow does perceiving speech differ from perceiving ordinary\nnon-linguistic sounds? Listening to music and listening to speech each\ndiffer from listening to other environmental sounds in the following\nrespect. In each case, one\u2019s interest in listening is to some\ndegree distanced from the specific environmental happenings involved\nin the production of sounds.\n\nBut this is true of listening to music and of listening to speech for\ndifferent reasons. In music, it is plausible that one\u2019s interest\nis in the sounds themselves, rather than in the sources of their\nproduction. However, speech is a vehicle for conventional linguistic\nmeaning. In listening to speech, one\u2019s main interest is in the\nmeanings, rather than in the sources of sound. Ultimately, the\ninformation conveyed is what matters.\n\nNevertheless, according to the most common philosophical\nunderstanding, perceiving spoken utterances is just a matter of\nhearing sounds. The sounds of speech are complex audible sound\nstructures. Listening to speech in a language you know typically\ninvolves grasping meanings, but grasping meanings requires\nfirst hearing the sounds of speech. According to this account,\ngrasping meanings itself is a matter of extra-perceptual\ncognition.\n\nThe commonplace view\u2014that perceiving speech is a variety of\nordinary auditory perception that just involves hearing the sounds of\nspeech\u2014has been challenged in a number of ways. The challenges\ndiffer in respect of how speech perception is held to differ from\nnon-linguistic audition.\n4.2.2 The Objects of Speech Perception\n\nFirst, consider the objects of speech perception. What are the\nobjects of speech perception, and do they differ from those of\nordinary or non-linguistic auditory perception? According to the\ncommonplace understanding, hearing speech involves hearing sounds.\nThus, hearing spoken language shares perceptual objects with ordinary\naudition. Alternatively, one might hold that the objects of speech\nperception are not ordinary sounds at all. Perhaps they are\nlanguage-specific entities, such as phonemes or words.\nPerhaps, as some have argued, perceiving speech involves perceiving\narticulatory gestures or movements of the mouth and vocal\norgans (see the supplement on\n Speech Perception: Empirical and Theoretical Considerations).\n Note that if audition\u2019s objects typically include distal\nevents, speech in this respect is not special, since its objects do\nnot belong to an entirely different kind from ordinary sounds. \n4.2.3 The Contents of Speech Perception\n\nSecond, consider the contents of speech perception. Does the\ncontent of speech perception differ from that of ordinary audition? If\nit does, how does the experience of perceiving speech differ from that\nof hearing ordinary sounds? Perceiving speech might involve hearing\nordinary sounds but auditorily ascribing distinctive features\nto them. These features might simply be, or comprise, finer grained\nqualitative and temporal acoustical details than non-linguistic sounds\naudibly possess. But perceiving speech also might involve perceiving\nsounds as belonging to language-specific types, such as\nphonemes, words, or other syntactic categories.\n\nFurthermore, speech perception\u2019s contents might differ in a more\ndramatic way from those of non-linguistic audition. Listening with\nunderstanding to speech involves grasping meanings. The\ncommonplace view is conservative. It holds that grasping meanings is\nan act of the understanding rather than of audition. Thus, the\ndifference between the experience of listening to speech in a language\nyou know and the experience of listening to speech in a language you\ndo not know is entirely cognitive.\n\nBut one might think that there also is a perceptual difference.\nA liberal account of this perceptual difference holds that perceiving\nspeech in a language you know may involve hearing sounds as\nmeaningful or auditorily representing them as having semantic\nproperties (see, e.g., Siegel 2006, Bayne 2009, Azzouni 2013, Brogaard\n2018; cf. O\u2019Callaghan 2011b, Reiland 2015). Alternatively, a\nmoderately liberal account holds that the perceptual experience of\nspeech in a language you know involves perceptually experiencing\nlanguage-specific but nevertheless non-semantic features. For\ninstance, O\u2019Callaghan (2011b) argues that listening to speech in\na familiar language typical involves perceiving its phonological\nfeatures.\n4.2.4 Is Speech Perception Auditory?\n\nThird, consider the processes responsible for speech\nperception. To what extent does perceiving speech implicate processes\nthat are continuous with those of ordinary or general audition, and to\nwhat extent does perceiving speech involve separate, distinctive, or\nmodular processes? While some defend general auditory accounts\nof speech perception (see, e.g, Holt and Lotto 2008), some argue that\nperceiving speech involves dedicated perceptual resources, or even an\nencapsulated perceptual system distinct from ordinary non-linguistic\naudition (see, e.g., Fodor 1983, Pinker 1994, Liberman 1996, Trout\n2001b). These arguments typically are grounded in several types of\nphenomena, including the multimodality of speech\nperception\u2014visual cues about the movements of the mouth and\ntongue impact the experience of speech, as demonstrated by the McGurk\neffect (see the section\n 4.3 Crossmodal Influences);\n duplex perception\u2014a particular stimulus sometimes\ncontributes simultaneously both to the experience of an ordinary sound\nand to that of a speech sound (Rand 1974); and the top-down\ninfluence of linguistic knowledge upon the experience of speech. A\nreasonable challenge is that each of these\ncharacteristics\u2014multimodality, duplex perception, and top-down\ninfluence\u2014also is displayed in general audition. \n\nSee the supplement on\n Speech Perception: Empirical and Theoretical Considerations.\n \n4.3 Crossmodal Influences\n4.3.1 Crossmodal Illusions\n\nAuditory perception of speech is influenced by cues from vision and\ntouch (see Gick et al. 2008). The McGurk effect in speech perception\nleads to an illusory auditory experience caused by a visual stimulus\n(McGurk and Macdonald 1976). Do such multimodal effects occur in\nordinary audition? Visual and tactile cues commonly do shape auditory\nexperience. The ventriloquist illusion is an illusory auditory\nexperience of location that is produced by an apparent visible sound\nsource (see, e.g., Bertelson 1999). Audition even impacts experience\nin other modalities. The sound-induced flash effect involves a visual\nillusion as of seeing two consecutive flashes that is produced when a\nsingle flash is accompanied by two consecutive beeps (Shams et al.\n2000, 2002). Such crossmodal illusions demonstrate that auditory\nexperience is impacted by other modalities and that audition\ninfluences other modalities. In general, experiences associated with\none perceptual modality are influenced by stimulation to other sensory\nsystems.\n4.3.2 Causal or Constitutive?\n\nAn important question is whether the impact is merely causal, or\nwhether perception in one modality is somehow constitutively tied to\nother modalities. If, for instance, vision merely causally impacts\nyour auditory experience of a given sound, then processes associated\nwith audition might be proprietary and characterizable in terms that\ndo not appeal to other modalities. Relying on information from vision\nor touch could simply improve the existing capacity to perceive space,\ntime, or spoken language auditorily. On the other hand, coordination\nbetween audition and other senses could enable a new perceptual\ncapacity. In that case, audition might rely constitutively on another\nsense.\n\nA first step in resolving this question is recognizing that crossmodal\nillusions are not mere accidents. Instead, they are intelligible as\nthe results of adaptive perceptual strategies. In ordinary\ncircumstances, crossmodal processes serve to reduce or resolve\napparent conflicts in information drawn from several senses. In doing\nso, they tend to make perception more reliable overall. Thus,\ncrossmodal illusions differ from synaesthesia. Synaesthesia is\njust a kind of accident. It results from mere quirks of processing,\nand it always involves illusion (or else is accidentally veridical).\nCrossmodal recalibrations, in contrast, are best understood as\nattempts \u201cto maintain a perceptual experience consonant with a\nunitary event\u201d (Welch and Warren 1980, 638).\n\nIn the first place, the principled reconciliation of information drawn\nfrom different sensory sources suggests that audition is governed by\nextra-auditory perceptual constraints. Moreover, since conflict\nrequires a common subject matter, such constraints must concern common\nsources of stimulation to multiple senses. If so, audition and vision\nshare a perceptual concern for a common subject matter. And that\nconcern is reflected in the organization of auditory experience. But\nthis by itself does not establish constitutive dependence of audition\non another sense.\n\nHowever, the perceptual concern for a common subject matter could be\nreflected as such in certain forms of auditory experience. For\ninstance, the commonality may be experientially evident in jointly\nperceiving shared spatio-temporal features, or in the perceptual\nexperience of audio-visual intermodal feature binding. If so, some\nforms of auditory perceptual experience may share with vision a common\nmultimodal or amodal content or character (see O\u2019Callaghan\n2008b, Clark 2011). More to the point, if coordination with another\nsense enables a new auditory capacity, then vision or touch could have\na constitutive rather than merely causal impact upon corresponding\nauditory experiences.\n4.3.3 Multimodality in Perception\n\nWhat hangs on this? First, it bears on questions about\naudition\u2019s content. If we cannot exhaustively characterize\nauditory experience in terms that are modality-specific or distinctive\nto audition, then we might hear as of things we can see or\nexperience with other senses. This is related to one puzzling question\nabout hearing sound sources: How could you hear as of something you\ncould see? Rather than just a claim about audition\u2019s content\nthat requires further explanation, we now have a story about why\nthings like sound sources figure in the content of auditory\nexperience. Second, all of this may bear on how to delineate what\ncounts as auditory perception, as opposed to visual or even amodal\nperception. If hearing is systematically impacted by visual processes,\nand if it shares content and phenomenology with other sense\nexperiences, what are the boundaries of auditory perception?\nMultimodal perception may bear on the question of whether there are\nclear and significant distinctions among the sense modalities (cf.\nNudds 2003). Finally, multimodal perceptual experiences, illusions,\nand explanatory strategies may illuminate the phenomenological\nunity of experiences in different modalities, or the sense in\nwhich, for instance, an auditory experience and a visual experience of\nsome happening comprise a single encompassing experience (see the\nentry on\n the unity of consciousness).\n \n\nWe can ask questions about the relationships among modalities in\ndifferent areas of explanatory concern. Worthwhile areas for attention\ninclude the objects, contents, and phenomenology of perception, as\nwell as perceptual processes and their architecture. Crossmodal and\nmultimodal considerations might shed doubt on whether vision-based\ntheorizing alone can deliver a complete understanding of perception\nand its contents. This approach constitutes an important\nmethodological advance in the philosophical study of perception (for\nfurther discussion, see O\u2019Callaghan 2012, 2019, Matthen 2015,\nStokes et al. 2015).\n5. Conclusion and Future Directions\n\nConsidering modalities other than vision enhances our understanding of\nperception. It is necessary to developing and vetting an adequate\ncomprehensive and general account of perception and its roles.\nAuditory perception is a rich territory for philosophical exploration\nin its own right, but it also provides a useful contrast case in which\nto evaluate claims about perception proposed in the context of vision.\nOne of the most promising directions for future work concerns the\nnature of the relationships among perceptual modalities, how these\nrelationships shape experience across modalities, and how they may\nprove essential to understanding perception itself. Philosophical work\non auditory perception thus is part of the advance beyond considering\nmodalities in isolation from each other.",
