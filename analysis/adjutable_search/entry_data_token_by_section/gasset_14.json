Social Reality, the \u201cMass Man\u201d and \u201cMass Society\u201d\n\nThe behavior and interaction of individuals in the social world, for\nOrtega, comprise a reality which becomes tangible and open to\nobjective analysis. This analysis reflects the perspective of social\nreality as the realm in which we may perceive and interpret the\nconcrete functions of human interactions. The substance of Ortega\u2019s\nobjective analysis of social relations was structured around his\ntheories of \u201ccreative, select minorities\u201d, \u201cmass\nman\u201d, and \u201cmass society\u201d. For Ortega, \u201cmass\nman\u201d and \u201cmass society\u201d are manifestations of social\nand historical phenomena that are perceptible, in part, through the\nobjective factor of their vast numbers and magnitude in the social\nworld. But, he points out immediately, the argument of sheer quantity\nhardly explains accurately or adequately the fact that \u201cwe see\nthe multitude, as such, in possession of the places and instruments\ncreated by civilization\u201d. More importantly, he averred, a sharp\nfocus on the intrinsic features of mass man and mass society that\nwould bring us much closer to discerning the essence of this concept\nthan its external manifestations of agglomeration and plenitude\n(Obras, VII: 144, 143). The philosophical dimensions of mass\nman, mass society and select minorities, as a theory of social\nrelations and human interaction and also as an analysis of social\nreality, must focus more attention on its qualitative characteristics\nthan its quantitative characteristics. That is, while making\nreferences to the quantitative factor of the concepts of masses and\nselect minorities as descriptive indicators of the coherence of one\ngroup of individuals vis-\u00e0-vis another group remains important\nand useful, references to the qualitative features of identifying what\nconstitute masses and select minorities becomes even more essential\ntoward an understanding not solely of unique individuals in society\nbut also of how these unique persons remain together as a dynamic\nunity.\n\n\nThe concept of the multitude is quantitative and visual. If we\ntranslate the concept into sociological terminology without changing\nits character, then we find the idea of social mass. Society is always\na dynamic unity of two component factors: minorities and masses. The\nminorities are individuals or groups of individuals who are specially\nqualified. The mass is an aggregate of persons not especially\nqualified. By masses, then, it is not to be understood, solely nor\nprincipally, \u201cthe working masses\u201d. The mass is \u201cthe\naverage man\u201d. In this manner, what was mere quantity\u2014the\nmultitude\u2014is converted into a qualitative determination: it\nbecomes the common social quality, man as undifferentiated from other\nmen, but as repeating in himself a generic type\u2026To form a\nminority, whatever it may be, it is necessary beforehand that each\nmember separate himself from the multitude for special,\nrelatively individual reasons\u2026. This coming together of the\nminority precisely in order to separate themselves from the majority\nis always introduced into the formation of every minority.\n(Obras, IV: 145\u201346)\n\n\nFor Ortega, the \u201cspecially qualified\u201d, \u201cselect\nman\u201d, must separate himself from the common values of everyone\nby placing greater demands on himself and by drawing upon the\nuniqueness of his radical reality. As we saw, to realize one\u2019s\npossibilities as a unique individual, one must occasionally withdraw\nfrom the social reality of others to the radical reality of his\n\u201cI\u201d. According to Ortega, in such circumstances, the\nindividual has to ignore momentarily the objective values of the\nsocial world and create the increasingly subjective values derived\nfrom the uniqueness of his being. This subjective withdrawal into the\n\u201csolitude\u201d of one\u2019s radical reality provides the necessary\nretreat of the select minorities whenever confronted with the\nconstraints of the masses, a process which resembles Nietzsche\u2019s\nconcept of the \u00fcbermensch. For Nietzsche, the\n\u00fcbermensch (over man) must liberate himself from the\nressentiment of \u201cslave morality\u201d by setting his\nown standards and by creating his own values (Nietzsche 1887 [1969:\n36\u201343]). We previously observed that in order to attempt to\ndevelop individual consciousness and realize the vital possibilities\nof his being, Ortega thinks the individual has to become absorbed\nwithin the circumstances of the social world and interact actively\nwith other individuals in the world. However, the development of\nindividual consciousness and the realization of one\u2019s vital\npossibilities also entail an occasional withdrawal from social reality\ninto the solitude of one\u2019s self (without remaining \u201chermetically\nenclosed\u201d and locked in the ego), with the purpose of possessing\nboth the unique individuality of the \u201cI\u201d (against the\nconstraints of society) and the positive process of reciprocal human\ninteraction. Although Ortega opined that \u201cthere is no creation\nwithout withdrawal into one\u2019s self\u201d, he also maintained that the\n\u201cI\u201d has to confront others actively and collide in the\nstrife he designates as \u201csocial relations\u201d. The dynamics\nof \u201cde-solitudinizing\u201d through actions and creations of\nthe individual in the social world, then, project the realm of\npossibilities not only from the \u201cI\u201d to the other and from\nthe other to the I, but also from our social world (in the\nhere-and-now) to their social world (in the future)\u2014in short,\nfrom one generation to the next. The individual, for Ortega, must\nwithdraw from the social world not solely to realize the vital\npossibilities of his own being, but also to attempt to create and\nactualize the vital possibilities of the social world through which\nthe circumstances of his very being (and the being of the others) are\ndefined. In this context, the individual, by engaging actively in the\nsocial reality surrounding his circumstances, contributes\nsubstantively to the making of the essence of society and history as\nwell as the essence of his own being (Obras, V: 79\u201380).\nThe spatial-temporality of man and his circumstances\u2014by way of\nhis life, society, consciousness of time and history\u2014will take\nus into Ortega\u2019s concept of the \u201cgeneration\u201d and its role\nin his philosophy of history.\n",
