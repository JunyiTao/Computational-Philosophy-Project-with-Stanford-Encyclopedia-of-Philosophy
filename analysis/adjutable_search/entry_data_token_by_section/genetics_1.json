    "main_text": "The Science of Genetics || Birth of a Discipline\n1.1 Birth of a Discipline\n\nGregor Mendel, the Austrian monk now commonly referred to as the\n\u201cfather of genetics\u201d, never uttered the terms\n\u201cgene\u201d or \u201cgenetics\u201d because those terms\nweren\u2019t introduced until decades after his death. In 1865, he\nreported on the results of breeding experiments he performed\nhybridizing pea plants during which he tracked how a series of traits\n(e.g., round vs. wrinkled peas, white vs. purple flowers) passed down\nthrough generations. Mendel noted certain patterns of inheritance; for\nexample, traits seemed to be transmitted independently of one another\n(Mendel 1866). Mendel died in 1884, at which point there was little\nindication that he would end up in biology textbooks (Olby 1985).\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1900 that the full force of Mendel\u2019s\nobservations became absorbed by the scientific community. That year,\nthree different European botanists reported on the results of their\nown breeding experiments and linked their results back to\nMendel\u2019s work decades earlier. Mendel\u2019s research, at this\ntime, was characterized as revealing heredity to involve the\ntransmission of discrete hereditary factors that obeyed fundamental\nprinciples\u2014that organisms get one copy of each factor from each\nparent and, in turn, pass one copy on to their own offspring (the law\nof segregation), that the factors segregate independently of one\nanother (the law of independent assortment), and that certain factors\ndominate other factors when it comes to expressing the trait\nassociated with that factor (the law of dominance) (entry:\n gene).\n William Bateson, a biologist at the University of Cambridge at the\ntime, was excited about the implications of Mendel\u2019s work for\ntheories of evolution; he recruited a number of young\nscientists\u2014women in particular\u2014to Cambridge to perform\nexperiments showing that Mendel\u2019s principles extended across the\nplant and animal kingdoms (Richmond 2001). He called this new\ndiscipline \u201cgenetics\u201d, and \u201cgene\u201d became the\nterm for the factor that was inherited (entry:\n the genotype/phenotype distinction).\n\nWith genetics carved out as a unique field of study, two threads of\ngenetic research ensued. One thread focused on identifying the\nphysical unit of heredity that was passed from generation to\ngeneration\u2014to figure out what genes were, where they were\nlocated, how they operated, and how that operation produced the\nhereditary patterns consistent with Mendel\u2019s principles (entry:\n theories of biological development).\n Thomas Hunt Morgan\u2019s research at Columbia University most\ncontributed to this work. Morgan studied fruit flies, in part because\nthey bred quickly and were easy to maintain. With a team of young\nscientists, he crossed thousands upon thousands of fruit flies,\ntracking how traits like eye color and wing shape transmitted across\ngenerations. They also induced mutations using a variety of chemical\nand radiation interventions (see the entry on\n experiment in biology).\n This research proved that genes were located on chromosomes, and it\nshowed how the physics of chromosomal action during meiosis impacted\nthe hereditary process; for example, genes closer together on\nchromosomes were more often inherited together, while genes that were\nfurther apart more often separated from one another during chromosomal\nrecombination. This realization allowed Morgan and his students to\nproduce the first gene maps\u2014charts of genes\u2019 relative\nlocations to one another\u2014and also determine that certain traits\nwere sex-linked due to their location on sex chromosomes (Darden 1991;\nKohler 1994).\n\nThe other thread of genetic research that emerged attended to the\nevolutionary implications of Mendelian inheritance. Charles Darwin\npublished On the Origin of Species in 1859, and the fact of\nevolution was widely recognized by 1900; however, the nature of the\nevolutionary process remained contested (Darwin 1859). According to\nDarwin, evolution was a very slow and gradual process, with natural\nselection favoring subtle differences between organisms (slightly\nlonger legs, for example) that inclined one to be more successful at\nreproduction in some particular environment (entry:\n Darwinism).\n Mendel\u2019s principles of inheritance, when they were hailed at\nthe turn of the twentieth century, were thought by many geneticists to\nbe incompatible with Darwinian evolution because Mendelian inheritance\nseemed more discrete (e.g., round or wrinkled peas, purple\nor white flowers), and so it was favored by scientists who\nadvocated for a faster and more discontinuous process of evolution.\nIndeed, one of the reasons that Bateson so eagerly championed\nMendel\u2019s work was because he was a proponent of this less\ngradual interpretation (entries:\n evolution;\n fitness).\n\nThe apparent incompatibility between Darwinian evolution and Mendelian\ninheritance persisted until 1918 when British biologist R.A. Fisher\nfirst indicated how the two sciences could be related; if traits were\nassumed to be the product of many Mendelian factors, then Darwinian\nnatural selection could favor subtle variations in the traits, and the\npopulations undergoing that selection pressure would gradually evolve\nall while the organisms in that population obeyed the Mendelian\nprinciples of inheritance (Fisher 1918). Fisher\u2019s contribution\nwas the first in a series of works\u2014most notably by he, J.B.S.\nHaldane, and Sewall Wright\u2014to reconceive of evolution as changes\nin population gene frequencies. The union of Mendel and Darwin came to\nbe called \u201cthe modern synthesis\u201d, and the mathematical\nmodels that Fisher, Haldane, and Wright developed launched the field\nof population genetics (Provine 1971; entry:\n population genetics).\n Evolutionary biology, which had long been made up of qualitative\narguments about, for example, the similarity between selection on\ndomesticated crops/livestock and selection in nature, suddenly became\nconcerned with mathematical arguments about the quantifiable\ninfluences of migration, genetic drift, mutation, and natural\nselection on populations (entries:\n ecological genetics;\n heritability;\n genetic drift).\n",
