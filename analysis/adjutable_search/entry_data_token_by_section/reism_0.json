    "main_text": "Brentano\u2019s Reism\n1. Brentano\u2019s Reism\n\n\nWhen arguing for reism Brentano was conscious of some related views of\nLeibniz. He even referred to Leibniz\u2019s statements (in Nouveaux\nessais) about the dangers caused by using abstract words.\nBrentano\u2019s reism was an effect of his departure from Aristotelian\nontology. Brentano\u2019s first metaphysics has a rich list of categories,\nincluding substances, modifications, circumstance, etc. Later, he\ndivided being into things and irrealia, and the latter into\nimmanent objects, contents, relations and so-called\ncollectiva. All items belonging to irrealia had the\nstatus of entia rationis (beings in the mind or thought\nobjects). Ultimately, Brentano rejected all entia rationis,\nthat is, intentional objects, immanent objects, states of affairs,\nexistence and non-existence, modalities, relations, probabilities,\nuniversals, Gestalten, time and space, Aristotelian forms, contents of\njudgements, etc.. His final ontological theory was based on the\nequality: being = entia realia = things. According to\nBrentano\u2019s later philosophy, things are concrete (particular)\nentities.  They are fully determined in their properties and are\nextended in time. Brentano distinguished two kinds of things, namely\nbodies (temporal and spatially extended) and souls (only\ntemporal).\n\n\nBrentano offered some methods on how to speak about entia\nrationis without being committed to their existence. Take the\nsentence:\n\n(1)\na is a thought object.\n\n\n\nOne can maintain that (1) refers to an immanent object (sense-data\nin the theory of perception are a good example here). According to\nBrentano, this sentence means:\n\n(2)\n A person X is thinking about\na.\n\n\n\nNow, (2) is about X not about a. Another\ninstructive example concerns universals. Consider:\n\n(3)\n Redness is a color.\n\n\n\nApparently, it seems to refer to two abstracts, namely Redness and\nColor. However, (3) means that all red things are red, and, by the\nrule of conversion of categorical sentences implies \n\n(4)\n some colored things are red;\n\n hence, the ontological commitment of (3) is reducible to\nindividuals (red things). According to Brentano, terms referring to\nentia rationis are actually not expressions functioning as\nnames, but they belong to so-called syncategorematica (or\nsynsemantica), that is, the category of expressions not\nhaving an autonomous meaning, but only a contextual one as for example,\nlogical constants (\u2018and\u2019, \u2018or\u2019,\netc.). Omitting sentences, only names of particulars are categorematic\n(or autosemantic). On the other hand, the nouns used to refer to\nentia rationis are useful because they simplify our\ndiscourse.  Nevertheless, we could live without abstract terms.\n\n\nBrentano also offered a quite general argument for reism based on the\nidea of intentionality as direction of thinking (and other mental\nacts). According to Brentano, the expression \u2018to think\u2019 is\nunivocal in the sense that it always refers to a definite mental act\ndirected to something. Accordingly \u2018to think\u2019 always means\n\u2018to think of something\u2019. This implies that the expression\n\u2018something\u2019 is univocal too, because there is no generic\nconcept comprising both things and non-things as object to which\nintentional acts refer. This argument assumes that\n\u2018something\u2019 is co-extensional with \u2018being\u2019.\nNow, if \u2018being\u2019 is the most general noun, there is no noun\nwhich refers to being and non-being. Hence, if \u2018something\u2019\nrefers to a thing at time t, it cannot refer to a non-thing\nat different time. Although Brentano himself considered this argument\nas fully conclusive, it is dubious whether he was right in this\nrespect.  His argument eventually implies that if\n\u2018something\u2019 refers to the objects a and\nb, both belong to the same ontological category, but not that\nthey are things, at least, in any ordinary sense. Thus, Brentano\u2019s\nargument for reism is at most an argument for a unicategorial ontology,\nthat is, an ontology based on only one kind of object. See section 4\nfor the further discussion.\n",
