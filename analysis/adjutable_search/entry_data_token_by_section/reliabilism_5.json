    "main_text": "Challenges and Replies || The New Evil Demon Problem\n2.2 The New Evil Demon Problem\n\nA second problem for process reliabilism is the \u201cnew evil-demon\nproblem\u201d (Cohen 1984; Pollock 1984; Feldman 1985; Foley 1985).\nImagine a world where an evil demon creates non-veridical perceptions\nof physical objects in everybody\u2019s minds. All of these\nperceptions are qualitatively identical to ours, but are false in the\nworld in question. Hence, their perceptual belief-forming processes\n(as judged by the facts in that world) are unreliable; and their\nbeliefs so caused are unjustified. But since their perceptual\nexperiences\u2014hence evidence\u2014are qualitatively identical to\nours, shouldn\u2019t those beliefs in the demon world be\njustified?\nApproved List Reliabilism\n\nAs with the clairvoyance objection, one response is to move from\nsimple reliabilism to approved list reliabilism (see\n \u00a72.1\n above). As before, approved-list reliabilists will maintain that a\npotential attributor constructs lists of belief-forming processes, one\nfor approved process types and one for disapproved types. Perceptual\nprocesses (of various sorts) would be on the approved list. Since the\npeople in the evil-demon case use perceptual processes that would be\non the approved list, an attributor would consider their resulting\nbeliefs justified\u2014even though s/he is told that the perceptual\nprocesses in the evil-demon world are unreliable.\nIndexical Reliabilism\n\nA number of philosophers have explored related ideas for solving the\nNew Evil Demon Problem. One similar strategy starts by distinguishing\ntwo different ways a process can be reliable. Suppose we inhabit the\nactual world (@), and we\u2019re evaluating a subject S who\ninhabits some other world \\(w_s\\). Then there are two different things\nwe could mean when we say that S\u2019s belief-forming process\nis reliable: we could mean that it\u2019s reliable relative to @, or\nwe could mean that it\u2019s reliable relative to \\(w_s\\) (Sosa 1993,\n2001). Comesa\u00f1a (2002) uses this distinction to provide a\nsolution to the new evil demon problem cast in the framework of\ntwo-dimensional semantics (Stalnaker 1999). On Comesa\u00f1a\u2019s\nproposal, the sentence, \u201cS is justified in believing\np\u201d has two readings: (i) that S\u2019s\nbelief-forming process is reliable relative to @, (ii) that\nS\u2019s belief-forming process is reliable relative to\n\\(w_s\\). If \\(w_s\\) is a demon world, then reading (i) will be true,\nbut reading (ii) is false. While Comesa\u00f1a\u2019s use of\ntwo-dimensional semantics has drawn criticism (Ball &\nBlome-Tillman 2013), the basic strategy of solving the New Evil Demon\nproblem by appealing to two types of reliability remains popular. For\ndiscussion of a related approach, see the discussion of normality\nreliabilism in\n \u00a73.1  below.\nDenying justification in Demon Worlds\n\nThe foregoing responses seek to accommodate the claim that the person\nin the demon world has justified beliefs (call this the \u201cNew\nEvil Demon Claim\u201d). Another response is to reject this claim.\nOne way of motivating the New Evil Demon Claim is by appealing to the\npremise that the person in the new evil demon scenario has the very\nsame evidence that we do at the actual world. However, some\nphilosophers reject this premise in favor of an externalist conception\nof evidence. For example, Williamson (2000: ch. 9) suggests that an\nagent\u2019s evidence is just their knowledge. Since the victim of an\nevil demon knows less than we do, it follows that they have less\nevidence than we do. As Schellenberg (2016) emphasizes, this sort of\nview is compatible with claiming that there is some evidence\nthat both we and the demon victim have in common. It\u2019s just that\nthere is further body of evidence that we possess but the demon victim\nlacks. This sort of responses raises larger questions about what\nreliabilists should say about the nature of evidence; for further\ndiscussion, see\n \u00a74.2\n below.\n\nPhilosophers who go this route typically emphasize that the beliefs of\nthe person at the demon world have some positive status, even if this\nstatus falls short of justification. For example, Lyons (2013) points\nout that the inferential beliefs of the demon\u2019s victim are\nformed by conditionally reliable processes, which is an epistemic good\nin its own right. Other philosophers have claimed that the beliefs of\nthe demon\u2019s victim are blameless or excusable, even though they\nare not justified (e.g., Pritchard 2012a). This issue is closely\nrelated to a growing recent literature on the relationship between\nepistemic justification and epistemic blamelessness (see, e.g., Kelp\n& Simon 2017; Brown 2018; D. Greco forthcoming; Williamson\nforthcoming).\n",
