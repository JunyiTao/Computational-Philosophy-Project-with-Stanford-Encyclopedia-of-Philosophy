From Mendelian Research and Models to the Present: Advances, Ambiguities and Persisting Questions\n\nThe conservatism expressed in Johannsen (1911) about identifying the\nmaterial basis of genes, as the nature of the germ cells shared by a\ngenotype, was not so evident among the Mendelian researchers who\nquickly came to adopt the new terms gene, genotype, and phenotype\nduring that decade. The focus moved beyond refuting what Johannsen\ncalled the \u201ctransmission-conception\u201d of heredity and\ntowards heredity as transmission in the new sense of genes going from\nparents to the germ cells of offspring\n (Figure 3).\n Research in laboratory genetics and agricultural breeding extended\nMendelian methods productively, but it also allowed some of the\nconceptual and methodological problems of Johannsen introduced in\n section 2\n to persist and ramify.\n",
