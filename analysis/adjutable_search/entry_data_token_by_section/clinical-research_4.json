    "main_text": "A Libertarian Analysis\n5. A Libertarian Analysis\n\nIt is often said that those working in bioethics are obsessed with the\nprinciple of respect for individual autonomy. Advocates of this view\nof bioethicists cite the high esteem accorded in the field to the\nrequirement of obtaining individual informed consent and the frequent\nattempts to resolve bioethical challenges by citing its satisfaction.\nOne might assume that this view within bioethics traces to implicit\nendorsement of a libertarian analysis according to which it is\npermissible for competent and informed individuals to do whatever they\nprefer, provided those with whom they interact are competent, informed\nand in agreement. In the words of Mill, investigators should be\npermitted to conduct research and expose participants to risks\nprovided they obtain their \u201cfree, voluntary, and undeceived\nconsent and participation\u201d (On Liberty, page 11). Setting aside\nthe question of whether this view accurately characterizes bioethics\nand bioethicists generally, it does not apply to the vast majority of\nwork done on the ethics of clinical research. Almost no one in the\nfield argues that it is permissible for investigators to conduct any\nresearch they want provided they obtain the free and informed consent\nof those they enroll.\n\nCurrent research ethics does place significant weight on informed\nconsent and many regulations and guidelines devote much of their\nlength to articulating the requirement for informed consent. Yet, as\nexemplified by the response to the Nuremberg Code, almost no one\nregards informed consent as necessary and sufficient for ethical\nresearch. Most regulations and guidelines, beginning with the\nDeclaration of Helsinki, first adopted in 1964 (World Medical\nOrganization 1996), allow investigators to conduct research on humans\nonly when it has been approved by an independent group charged with\nensuring that the study is ethically acceptable. Most regulations\nfurther place limits on the types of research that independent ethics\ncommittees may approve. They must find that the research has important\nsocial value and the risks have been minimized, thereby restricting\nthe types of research to which even competent adults may consent. Are\nthese requirements justified, or are they inappropriate infringements\non the free actions of competent individuals? The importance of\nanswering this question goes beyond its relevance to debates over\nLibertarianism. Presumably, the requirements placed on clinical\nresearch have the effect of reducing to some extent the number of\nresearch studies that get conducted. The fact that at least some of\nthe prohibited studies likely would have important social value,\nhelping to identify better ways to promote health and well-being,\nprovides a normative reason to eliminate the restrictions, unless\nthere is some compelling reason to retain them.\n\nThe libertarian claim that valid informed consent is necessary and\nsufficient to justify exposing research participants to risks for the\nbenefit of others seems to imply, consistent with the first principle\nof the Nuremberg Code, that research with individuals who cannot\nconsent is unethical. This plausible and tempting claim commits one to\nthe view that research with children, research in many emergency\nsituations, and research with the demented elderly all are ethically\nimpermissible. One could consistently maintain such a view but the\nsocial costs of adopting it would be great. It is estimated, for\nexample, that approximately 70% of medications provided to children\nhave not been tested in children, even for basic safety and efficacy\n(Roberts, Rodriquez, Murphy, Crescenzi 2003; Field & Behrman 2004;\nCaldwell, Murphy, Butow, and Craig 2004). Absent clinical research\nwith children, pediatricians will be forced to continue to provide\nfrequently inappropriate treatment, leading to significant harms that\ncould have been avoided by pursuing clinical research to identify\nbetter approaches.\n\nOne response would be to argue that the Libertarian analysis is not\nintended as an analysis of the conditions under which clinical\nresearch is acceptable. Instead, the claim might be that it provides\nan analysis of the conditions under which it is acceptable to conduct\nclinical research with competent adults. Informed consent is necessary\nand sufficient for enrolling competent adults in research. While this\nview does not imply that research with participants who cannot consent\nis impermissible, it faces the not insignificant challenge of\nproviding an account for why such research might be acceptable.\n\nBracketing the question of individuals who cannot consent, many of the\nlimitations on clinical research apply to research with competent\nadults. How might these limitations be justified? One approach would\nbe to essentially grant the Libertarian analysis on theoretical\ngrounds, but then argue that the conditions for its implementation are\nrarely realized in practice. In particular, there are good reasons,\nand significant empirical data, to question how often clinical\nresearch actually involves participants who are sufficiently informed\nto provide valid consent. Even otherwise competent adults often fail\nto understand clinical research sufficiently to make their own\ninformed decisions regarding whether to enroll (Flory and Emanuel\n2004).\n\nTo consider an example which is much discussed in the research ethics\nliterature, it is commonly assumed that valid consent for randomized\nclinical trials requires individuals to understand randomization. It\nrequires individuals to understand that the treatment they will\nreceive, if they enroll in the study, will be determined by a process\nwhich does not take into account which of the treatments is better for\nthem (Kupst 2003). There is an impressive wealth of data which\nsuggests that many, perhaps most individuals who participate in\nclinical research do not understand this (Snowden 1997; Featherstone\nand Donovan 2002; Appelbaum 2004). The data also suggest that these\nfailures of understanding often are resistant to educational\ninterventions.\n\nWith this in mind, one might regard the limitations on research with\ncompetent adults as betraying the paternalism embedded in most\napproaches to the ethics of clinical research (Miller and Wertheimer\n2007). Although the charge of paternalism often carries with it some\ndegree of condemnation, there is a strong history of what is regarded\nas appropriate paternalism in the context of clinical research. This\ntoo may have evolved from clinical medicine. Clinicians are charged\nwith protecting and promoting the interests of the patient \u201cin\nfront of them\u201d. Clinician researchers, who frequently begin\ntheir careers as clinicians, may regard themselves as similarly\ncharged. Paternalism involves interfering with the liberty of agents\nfor their own benefit (Feinberg 1986; see also entry on\n paternalism).\n As the terms are used in the present debate, \u2018soft\u2019\npaternalism involves interfering with the liberty of an individual in\norder to promote their interests on the grounds that the action being\ninterfered with is the result of impaired decision-making: \u201cA\nfreedom-restricting intervention is based on soft paternalism only\nwhen the target\u2019s decision-making is substantially impaired,\nwhen the agent lacks (or we have reason to suspect that he lacks) the\ninformation or capacity to protect his own interests\u2014as when\nA prevents B from drinking the liquid in a glass because\nA knows it contains poison but B does not\u201d (Miller\n& Wertheimer 2007). \u2018Hard\u2019 paternalism, in contrast,\ninvolves interfering with the liberty of an individual in order to\npromote their interests, despite the fact that the action being\ninterfered with is the result of an informed and voluntary choice by a\ncompetent individual.\n\nIf the myriad restrictions on clinical research were justified on the\nbasis of hard paternalism they would represent restrictions on\nindividuals\u2019 autonomous actions. However, the data on the extent\nto which otherwise competent adults fail to understand what they need\nto understand to provide valid consent suggests that the limitations\ncan instead be justified on the grounds of soft paternalism. This\nsuggests that while the restrictions may limit the liberty of adult\nresearch participants, they do not limit their autonomy. In this way,\none may regard many of the regulations on clinical research not as\ninconsistent with the libertarian ideal, but instead as starting from\nthat ideal and recognizing that otherwise competent adults often fail\nto attain it.\n\nEven if most research participants had sufficient understanding to\nprovide valid consent, it would not follow that there should be no\nlimitations on research with competent adults. The conditions on what\none individual may do to another are not exhausted by what the second\nindividual consents to. Perhaps some individuals may choose for\nthemselves to be treated with a lack of respect, even tortured. It\ndoes not follow that it is acceptable for me or you to treat them\naccordingly. As independent moral agents we need sufficient reason to\nbelieve that our actions, especially the ways in which we treat\nothers, are appropriate, and this evaluation concerns, in typical\ncases, more than just the fact that the affected individuals consented\nto them.\n\nUnderstood in this way, many of the limitations on the kinds of\nresearch to which competent adults may consent are not justified, or\nat least not solely justified, on paternalistic grounds. Instead,\nthese limitations point to a crucial and often overlooked concern in\nresearch ethics. The regulations for clinical research often are\ncharacterized as protecting the participants of research from harm.\nAlthough this undoubtedly is an important and perhaps primary function\nof the regulations, they also have an important role in limiting the\nextent to which investigators harm research participants, and limiting\nthe extent to which society supports and benefits from a process which\ninappropriately harms others. It is not just that research\nparticipants should not be exposed to risk of harm without compelling\nreason. Investigators should not expose them to such risks without\ncompelling reason, and society should not support and benefit from\ntheir doing so.\n\nThis aspect of the ethics of clinical research has strong connections\nwith the view that the obligations of clinicians restrict what sort of\nclinical research they may conduct. On that view, it is the fact that\none is a physician and is obligated to promote the best interests of\nthose with whom one interacts professionally which determines what one\nis allowed to do to participants. This connection highlights the\npressing questions that arise once we attempt to move beyond the view\nthat clinical research is subject to the norms of clinical medicine.\nThere is a certain plausibility to the claim that a researcher is not\nacting as a clinician and so may not be subject to the obligations\nthat bear on clinicians. Or perhaps we might say that the\nresearcher/subject dyad is distinct from the physician/patient dyad\nand is not necessarily subject to the same norms. But, once we\nconclude that we need an account of the ethics of clinical\nresearch, distinct from the ethics of clinical care, one is left with\nthe question of which limitations apply to what researchers may do to\nresearch participants.\n\nIt seems clear that researchers may not expose research participants\nto risks without sufficient justification, and also clear that this\nclaim applies even to those who provide free and informed consent. The\ncurrent challenge then is to develop an analysis of the conditions\nunder which it is acceptable for investigators to expose participants\nto risks and determine to what extent current regulations need to be\nmodified to reflect this analysis. To consider briefly the extent of\nthis challenge, and to underscore and clarify the claim that the\nethics of clinical research go beyond the protection of research\nparticipants to include the independent consideration of what\nconstitutes appropriate behavior on the part of investigators,\nconsider an example.\n\nPhysical and emotional abuse cause enormous suffering, and a good deal\nof research is designed to study various methods to reduce instances\nof abuse and also to help victims recover from being abused. Imagine\nthat a team of investigators establishes a laboratory to promote the\nlatter line of research. The investigators will enroll consenting\nadults and, to mimic the experience of extended periods of abuse in\nreal life, they will abuse their participants emotionally and\nphysically for a week. The abused participants will then be used in\nstudies to evaluate the efficacy of different methods for helping\nvictims to cope with the effects of abuse.\n\nThe proper response to this proposal is not to claim that the study is\nacceptable because the participants are competent and they gave\ninformed consent. The proper response is to point out that, while\nthese considerations are undoubtedly important, they do not\nestablish that the study is ethically acceptable. One needs to\nconsider many other things. Is the experiment sufficiently similar to\nreal life abuse that its results will have external validity? Are\nthere less risky ways to obtain the same results? Finally, even if\nthese questions are answered in a way that supports the research, the\nquestion remains whether investigators may ethically treat their\nparticipants in this way. The fact that essentially everyone working\nin research ethics would hold that this study is\nunethical\u2014investigators are not permitted to treat participants\nin this way\u2014suggests that research ethics, both in terms of how\nit is practiced and possibly how it should be practiced, goes beyond\nrespect for individual autonomy to include independent standards on\ninvestigator behavior. Defining those standards represents one of the\nmore important challenges for research ethics.\n\nAs exemplified by Lind\u2019s experiments on treatments for scurvy,\nclinical research studies were first conducted by clinicians wondering\nwhether the methods they were using were effective. To answer this\nquestion, the clinicians altered the ways in which they treated their\npatients in order to yield information that would allow them to assess\ntheir methods. In this way, clinical research studies initially were\npart of, but an exception to standard clinical practice. As a result,\nclinical research came to be seen as an essentially unique activity.\nAnd widespread recognition of clinical research\u2019s scandals and\nabuses led to the view that this activity needed its own extensive\nregulations.\n\nMore recently, some commentators have come to question the view that\nclinical research is a unique human activity, as well as the\nregulations and guidelines which result from this view. In particular,\nit has been argued that this view has led to overly restrictive\nrequirements on clinical research, requirements that hinder\nscientists\u2019 ability to improve medical care for future patients,\nand also fail to respect the liberty of potential research\nparticipants. This view is often described in terms of the claim that\nmany regulations and guidelines for clinical research are based on an\nunjustified \u2018research exceptionalism\u2019 (Wertheimer\n2010).\n\nThe central ethical concern raised by clinical research involves the\npractice of exposing participants to risks for the benefit of others.\nYet, as noted previously, we are constantly exposing individuals to\nrisks for our benefit and the benefit of others. When you drive to the\nstore, you expose your neighbors to some increased risk of pollution\nfor the benefits you derive from shopping; speeding ambulances expose\npedestrians to risks for the benefit of the patients they carry;\nfactories expose their workers to risks for the benefit of their\ncustomers; charities expose volunteers to risks for the benefit of\nrecipients. Despite this similarity, clinical research is widely\nregarded as ethically problematic and is subject to significantly\ngreater regulation, review, and oversight (Wilson and Hunter 2010).\nAlmost no one regards driving, ambulances, charities, or factories as\ninherently problematic. Even those who are not great supporters of a\ngiven charity do not argue that it treats its volunteers as guinea\npigs, despite exposing them to risks for the benefit of others. And no\none argues that charitable activities should satisfy the requirements\nthat are routinely applied to clinical research, such as the\nrequirements for independent review and written consent based on an\nexhaustive description of the risks and potential benefits of the\nactivity, its purpose, duration, scope, and procedures.\n\nGiven that many activities expose some to risks for the benefit of\nothers, yet are not subject to such extensive regulation, some\ncommentators conclude that many of the requirements for clinical\nresearch are unjustified (Sachs 2010, Stewart et al. 2008, and\nSullivan 2008). This work is based on the assumption that, when it\ncomes to regulation and ethical analysis, we should treat clinical\nresearch as we treat other activities in daily life which involve\nexposing some to risks for the benefit of others. This assumption\nleads to a straightforward solution to the central ethical problem\nposed by clinical research.\n\nExposing factory workers to risks for the benefit of others is deemed\nethically acceptable when they agree to do the work and are paid a\nfair wage. The solution suggested for the ethical concern of\nnon-beneficial research is to obtain consent and pay research\nparticipants a fair wage for their efforts. This view is much less\nrestrictive than current regulations for clinical research, but seems\nto be less permissive than a Libertarian analysis. The latter\ndifference is evident in claims that research studies should treat\nparticipants fairly and not exploit them, even if individuals consent\nto being so treated.\n\nThe gap between this approach and the traditional view of research\nethics is evident in the fact that advocates of the traditional view\ntend to regard payment of research participants as exacerbating rather\nthan resolving its ethical concerns, raising, among others, worries of\nundue inducement and commodification. Those who are concerned about\nresearch exceptionalism, in contrast, tend to regard payment as it is\nregarded in most other contexts in daily life: some is good and more\nis better.\n\nThe claims of research exceptionalism have led to valuable discussion\nof the extent to which clinical research differs from other activities\nwhich pose risks to participants for the benefit of others and whether\nany of the differences justify the extensive regulations and\nguidelines standardly applied to clinical research. Proponents of\nresearch exceptionalism who regard many of the existing regulations as\nunjustified face the challenge of articulating an appropriate set of\nregulations for clinical research. While comparisons to factory work\nprovide a useful lens for thinking about the ethics of clinical\nresearch, it is not immediately obvious what positive recommendations\nfollow from this perspective. After all, it is not as if there is\ngeneral consensus regarding the regulations to which industry should\nbe subject. Some endorse minimum wage laws; others oppose them. There\nare further arguments over whether workers should be able to unionize;\nwhether governments should set safety standards for industry; whether\nthere should be rules protecting workers against discrimination.\n",
