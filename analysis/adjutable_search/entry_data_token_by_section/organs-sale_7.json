    "main_text": "Altruism || Is altruism (always) a good thing?\n4.1 Is altruism (always) a good thing?\n\n\nAltruism is usually defined as acting out of a concern for the\nwell-being of others (Nagel 1970; Scott & Seglow\n2007). Why might one think that such actions are morally good? Two\nmain answers are available. The first is that altruism is intrinsically\ngood and to be contrasted with morally bad characteristics and\nmotivations, in particular selfishness. The second (which is not\nincompatible with the first) says that altruism is good because of its\npositive effects, not only its direct effects on the person to whom the\naltruism is directed but also its indirect effects on society.\nBoth answers have considerable plausibility. Many examples of\nacting out of disinterested concern for the well-being of others do\nseem to be clear-cut cases of moral virtue. And it seems\nlikely that, all other things being equal, a society with more\naltruistic acts would be a better place to live than one with\nfewer.\n\n\nThat said, two reservations about the claim that altruism is a good\nthing should be noted. First, altruistic acts are not always morally\ngood. Scott and Seglow (2007, 2) give the following very\npertinent example:\n\n\nConsider the racist organ donor \u2026 who wishes to donate their\norgans, but only to those of their own race. They are altruistic\nbut hardly moral.\n\n\nIndeed, there seem to be several ways in which an altruistic act might\nbe wrong. For example:\n\n The\naltruist is culpably mistaken about what is really in the interests of\nthe person s/he is trying to help and ends up harming rather than\nhelping.\n\n The\naltruist benefits the person s/he is trying to help, but her\nintervention is wrongfully paternalistic.\n\nThe\naltruist benefits the person s/he is trying to help, but in so doing\nwrongfully harms innocent third parties.\n\n\nIt is not hard to come up with examples in which A\nloves B so much that\nA is prepared to do bad things to a third party, C,\nin order to benefit\nA. Such cases range from minor wrongdoing to serious evil. So, as\nMcLachlan (1998) points out, while many acts of altruism are paradigm\ncases of virtue, others are \u2018extremely wicked\u2019.\n\nIn defence of the value of altruism, it could be argued that even\nthough many altruistic acts are wrong, all things considered,\nnonetheless altruism is always a positive (or\n\u2018right-making\u2019) characteristic. On this view, the\nanalysis of Scott and Seglow's racist donor example is that,\nwhile his racism is to be condemned, his altruism is not and that, in\nthe case of racist donation (assuming that this really is wrong, all\nthings considered), the \u2018negative\u2019 racism simply\noutweighs the \u2018positive\u2019 altruism. If this\nview is correct, then the claim that some altruistic acts are wrong\nbecomes less relevant than it might at first appear, since what matters\nis the value of altruism as a positive moral property of\nactions, not whether all altruistic acts are good or permissible\nall things considered.\n",
