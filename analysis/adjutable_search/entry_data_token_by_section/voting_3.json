    "main_text": "The Rationality of Voting || Other Reasons to Vote\n1.3 Other Reasons to Vote\n\nOther philosophers have attempted to shift the focus on other ways\nindividual votes might be said to \u201cmake a difference\u201d.\nPerhaps by voting, a voter has a significant chance of being among the\n\u201ccausally efficacious set\u201d of votes, or is in some way\ncausally responsible for the outcome (Tuck 2008; Goldman 1999).\n\nOn these theories, what voters value is not changing the outcome, but\nbeing agents who have participated in causing various outcomes. These\ncausal theories of voting claim that voting is rational provided the\nvoter sufficiently cares about being a cause or among the joint causes\nof the outcome. Voters vote because they wish to bear the right kind\nof causal responsibility for outcomes, even if their individual\ninfluence is small.\n\nWhat these alternative theories make clear is that whether voting is\nrational depends in part upon what the voters\u2019 goals are. If\ntheir goal is to in some way change the outcome of the election, or to\nchange which policies are implemented, then voting is indeed\nirrational, or rational only in unusual circumstances or for a small\nsubset of voters. However, perhaps voters have other goals.\n\nThe expressive theory of voting (G. Brennan and Lomasky 1993) holds\nthat voters vote in order to express themselves. On the expressive\ntheory, voting is a consumption activity rather than a productive\nactivity; it is more like reading a book for pleasure than it is like\nreading a book to develop a new skill. On this theory, though the act\nof voting is private, voters regard voting as an apt way to\ndemonstrate and express their commitment to their political team.\nVoting is like wearing a Metallica T-shirt at a concert or doing the\nwave at a sports game. Sports fans who paint their faces the team\ncolors do not generally believe that they, as individuals, will change\nthe outcome of the game, but instead wish to demonstrate their\ncommitment to their team. Even when watching games alone, sports fans\ncheer and clap for their teams. Perhaps voting is like this.\n\nThis \u201cexpressive theory of voting\u201d is untroubled by and\nindeed partly supported by the empirical findings that most voters are\nignorant about basic political facts (Somin 2013; Delli Carpini and\nKeeter, 1996). The expressive theory is also untroubled by and indeed\npartly supported by work in political psychology showing that most\ncitizens suffer from significant \u201cintergroup bias\u201d: we\ntend to automatically form groups, and to be irrationally loyal to and\nforgiving of our own group while irrationally hateful of other groups\n(Lodge and Taber 2013; Haidt 2012; Westen, Blagov, Harenski, Kilts,\nand Hamann 2006; Westen 2008). Voters might adopt ideologies in order\nto signal to themselves and others that they are certain kinds of\npeople. For example, suppose Bob wants to express that he is a patriot\nand a tough guy. He thus endorses hawkish military actions, e.g., that\nthe United States nuke Russia for interfering with Ukraine. It would\nbe disastrous for Bob were the US to do what he wants. However, since\nBob\u2019s individual vote for a militaristic candidate has little\nhope of being decisive, Bob can afford to indulge irrational and\nmisinformed beliefs about public policy and express those beliefs at\nthe polls.\n\nAnother simple and plausible argument is that it can be rational to\nvote in order to discharge a perceived duty to vote (Mackie 2010).\nSurveys indicate that most citizens in fact believe there is a duty to\nvote or to \u201cdo their share\u201d (Mackie 2010: 8\u20139). If\nthere are such duties, and these duties are sufficiently weighty, then\nit would be rational for most voters to vote.\n",
