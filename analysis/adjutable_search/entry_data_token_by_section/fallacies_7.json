    "main_text": "History of Fallacy Theory || Whately\n2.7 Whately\n\nBook III of Richard Whately\u2019s Elements of Logic (1826)\nis devoted to giving an account of fallacies based on \u201clogical\nprinciples,\u201d. Whately was instrumental in the revival of\ninterest in logic at the beginning of the nineteenth century and,\nbeing committed to deductivism, he maintained that only valid\ndeductive inferences counted as reasoning. Thus, he took every fallacy\nto belong to either the class of deductive failures (logical\nfallacies) or the class of non-logical failures (material\nfallacies).\n\nBy \u2018fallacy\u2019 Whately meant \u201cany unsound mode of\narguing, which appears to demand our conviction, and to be decisive of\nthe question at hand, when in fairness it is not\u201d\u2019 (Bk.\nIII, intro.). The logical fallacies divide into the purely logical and\nthe semi-logical fallacies. The purely logical fallacies are plain\nviolations of syllogistic rules like undistributed middle and illicit\nprocess. The semi-logical fallacies mostly trade on ambiguous middle\nterms and are therefore also logical fallacies, but their detection\nrequires extra-logical knowledge including that of the senses of\n terms[4]\n and knowledge of the subject matter (Bk. III, \u00a72); they include,\namong others, the fallacies of ambiguity, and division and\ncomposition. The non-logical, material fallacies are also divided into\ntwo classes: fallacies with premises \u2018unduly assumed,\u2019 and\nfallacies of irrelevant conclusions. Begging the question fits under\nthe heading of a non-logical, material fallacy in which a premise has\nbeen unduly assumed, and ignoratio elenchi is a non-logical,\nmaterial fallacy in which an irrelevant conclusion has been reached.\nThe ad-arguments are all placed under the last division as\nvariants of ignoratio elenchi, but they are said to be\nfallacies only when they are used unfairly. Whately\u2019s version of\nthe ad hominem argument resembles Locke\u2019s in that it is\nan ex concessis kind of argument: one that depends on the\nconcessions of the person with whom one is arguing. From the\nconcessions, one might prove that one\u2019s opponent is\n\u2018committed to p,\u2019 but an attempt to make it seem\nas if this constitutes a proof of the absolute (non-relative)\nproposition \u2018p\u2019 would be a fallacy. This kind of\nad hominem fallacy can be seen as falling under the broader\nignoratio elenchi category because what is proved is not what\nis needed.\n\nThe creation of the category of non-logical fallacies was not really a\nbreak with Aristotle as much as it was a break with what had become\nthe Aristotelian tradition. Aristotle thought that some fallacies were\ndue to unacceptable premises although these are not elaborated in\nSophistical Refutations (see section 2.1.1 above).\nWhately\u2019s creation of the category of non-logical fallacies\nsolved the problem of what to do with begging the question which is\nnot an invalid form of argument, and it also created a place in\nfallacy taxonomy for the ad-fallacies.\n",
