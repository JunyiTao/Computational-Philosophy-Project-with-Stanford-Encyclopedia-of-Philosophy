    "main_text": "The New Traditionalism || Two concerns about the narrative\n9. Summary\n\n\nThe theologico-political problem is one that concerns the problem of\npolitical authority. In its contemporary form, it primarily\nconcerns the justification of authoritative political acts, such as the\nimplementation of coercive laws. Can religious reasons justify\nthe implementation of such laws? This is the central question\nwith which political philosophers have been concerned. The\nstandard view tells us that religious reasons are never sufficient to\njustify coercive law. It therefore champions the DRR, or the\nclaim that, if a citizen is trying to determine whether or not she\nshould support some coercive law, and if she believes that there is no\nplausible secular rationale for it, then it is impermissible for her to\nsupport that law. The main responses to the standard view divides\ninto two types. Liberal critics of the view hold fast to the\nprinciples of liberal democracy but reject the DRR\u2014in part for\nthe reason that the DRR is illiberal. New Traditionalists, by\ncontrast, reject both liberal democracy itself and the DRR, viewing the\nlatter as more or less a component of the former. (On this latter\npoint, they agree with advocates of the standard view.)\n\n\n Is there likely to be any sort of\nrapprochement between these views? It is difficult to know.\nSometimes, however, positions that occupy the conceptual middle-ground\nin a debate are the best candidates for unifying what can appear to be\nirreconcilable positions. In the case at hand, the liberal\ncritics appear to occupy this conceptual middle-ground, straddling the\nstandard view and the New Traditionalism. On the one hand, the\nliberal critics find themselves sympathetic with the political\ncommitments of the standard view but not with the wariness about\nreligion that often animates this position. On the other hand,\nthe liberal critics find themselves sympathetic with some of the\nreligious commitments embraced by the New Traditionalists but not with\ntheir suspicion of liberal democracy. Nevertheless, the liberal\ncritics are vulnerable to criticisms from both sides. Advocates\nof the standard view will charge that they do not take seriously enough\nthe destructive and divisive effects of religion, hard to quantify as\nthey might be. And friends of the New Traditionalism will\nmaintain that they fail to recognize the corrosive effects of liberal\ndemocracy on traditional religious ways of life. These are\nimportant criticisms, married to passions that deeply divide the\nproponents of these views. Still, members of all parties to the\ndebate agree that the task at hand is to articulate ways in which\ncitizens of a deeply pluralistic liberal democracy can conduct their\nbehavior in manners that are not only faithful to whatever religious\nidentities they may have, but are also just and contribute to the\ncommon good.\n",
