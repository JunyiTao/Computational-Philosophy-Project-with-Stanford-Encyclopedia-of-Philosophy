    "main_text": "The Shifting Status of Multiple Realizability Early in the New Millennium || New Attacks on Multiple Realizability\n3.2 New Attacks on Multiple Realizability\n\nCritics of multiple realizability and the standard arguments it has\nfigured into also extended their reach early in the twenty-first\ncentury. Lawrence Shapiro (2008) raises some methodological\ndifficulties involved in testing whether a given psychological kind\nactually is multiply realized. (For a related argument see Thomas\nPolger 2009.) Shapiro reminds us of the crucial role that auxiliary\nassumptions play in hypothesis testing generally (within a broadly\nhypothetico-deductive model), and considers a collection of explicit\nauxiliary assumptions that might be implicitly used to establish a\nmultiple realization hypothesis. He presents a recent ferret\nbrain-rewiring experiment as a scientific example, in which axonal\ninputs from the primary visual tract were redirected in ferret embryos\nto project to primary auditory cortex (see Sharma, Angelucci, &\nSur 2000 for the scientific details). An auxiliary hypothesis\nrequiring multiply realized higher-level (in this case, psychological)\nkinds to be \u201cexactly similar\u201d\u2014identical\u2014across\ndistinct realizers won\u2019t help the proponent of the standard\nmultiple realizability argument with this purported case. It is easy\nto measure better visual performance in the normally-wired control\nferrets compared to the re-wired experimental animals. While the\nexperimentally re-wired animals have some visual function, it is\ndiminished significantly compared to controls. \u201cExact\nsimilarity\u201d (identity) of visual function is thus not present\nacross these groups. On the other hand, one might argue for the\nmultiple realizability premise in this ferret re-wiring case using an\nauxiliary hypothesis that only requires similarity in multiply\nrealized higher level properties, yet still requires that differences\nacross the realizers should not be limited only to the differences\nthat cause differences in the realized (in this case, visual)\nproperties. Shapiro speculates that this auxiliary assumption seems\nbest to capture the sense of multiple realization stressed by\nproponents of the standard argument. But if we adopt it, again the\nferret re-wiring case seems not to provide an empirical instance of\nmultiple realization. Shapiro remarks: \u201cthe differences in\nferret brains explain nothing more than differences in ferret visual\nproperties\u201d (2008: 523). Shapiro also argues that his detailed\ndiscussion of hypothesis testing difficulties for any multiple\nrealization hypothesis reveals a flaw in Bechtel and Mundale\u2019s\n(1999) influential criticism (discussed in\n \u00a72.3\n above). Bechtel and Mundale\u2019s examples, drawn from the\ncomparative functional neuroanatomy of vision, only compared\nhomologous brain structures. But these only have differences that make\na difference in their visual properties, nothing else. Instead of\nthese examples, Shapiro insists, \u201cone should be looking at\ndifferent brains that reveal similar visual properties despite their\ndifferences\u201d (2008: 524)\u2014exactly the kinds of evidence\nthat Bechtel and Mundale\u2019s emphasis on homologies doesn\u2019t\nconsider.\n\nShapiro and Polger (2012) build upon Shapiro\u2019s account of the\ncomplexity of actually testing for scientifically-justified multiple\nrealization. They insist that these actual details render the\nsignificance of multiple realization far more dubious than\nphilosophers of mind typically suppose. They introduce explicit\ncriteria to capture the common assumption that multiple realization\nrequires not merely differences between realizing kinds, but\n\u201cdifferently the same\u201d: the features of entities A\nand B that lead them to be classified differently by the\nrealizing science S2 \u201cmust be among those that\nlead them to be commonly classified\u201d by the realized science\nS1 (2012: 282, criterion iii). This explicit\ncriterion rules out the popular assertion that camera eyes versus\ncompound eyes, with different photoreceptive chemicals in their\nretinal cones, is a genuine (empirical) instance of multiple\nrealization. Considered coarsely, such eyes are doing the same thing\nin the same way, so they\u2019re not \u201cdifferently the\nsame\u201d. Considered finely, the two kinds of eyes are sensitive to\ndifferent ranges and peaks of spectral stimulation, so they\u2019re\n\u201cdifferently different, not differently the same\u201d (2012:\n283\u2013284).\n\nShapiro and Polger\u2019s final explicit criterion captures the\n\u201cdifferently the same\u201d intuition in terms of quantitative\ndifferences. The relevant variation between entities A and\nB in realizing science S2 \u201cmust be\ngreater than\u201d the individual differences between A and\nB recognized by the realized science S1\n(2012: 282, criterion iv). The variation recognized by the realizing\nscience must not merely map onto individual differences between\nA and B recognized by the realized science. The demands\nin actually establishing multiple realization are thus quite strict.\nNot any old variation will do. According to Shapiro and Polger, these\nstrict demands show both that multiple realization in the sense\nrequired to fund the standard argument is \u201ca relatively rare\nphenomenon\u201d\u2014despite the vast variability everywhere in the\nworld\u2014and that a \u201crelatively modest\u201d mind-brain\nidentity theory has little to worry from it (2012: 284).\n\nSimilar in some ways to Couch\u2019s arguments (discussed in\n \u00a72.4\n above), Colin Klein raises a challenge to the scientific\ncontributions made by multiply realized kinds. Noting the variety of\nthings that materials science classifies as \u201cbrittle,\u201d\nKlein (2008) notes that few to none of the many scientific discoveries\nabout realization-restricted brittle things\u2014for example, about\nbrittle steel\u2014generalize to other realization-restricted\ntypes\u2014such as brittle glass. Klein insists that generalizations\nabout genuine scientific kinds should be projectable across instances\nof those kinds, so this requirement seems not to be met by a\nsignificant class of multiple realized kinds, namely, the\nrealization-restricted ones. Applying this point to psychological\nkinds, instead of supporting a scientifically-backed nonreductive\nphysicalism, it appears rather that special sciences should abandon\nmultiply realized kinds. Klein notes that proponents of\nscientifically-based multiple realizability can find terms in special\nsciences that figure in legitimate explanations, and so appear to\nrefer to projectable multiply realize kinds. But close investigation\nof some paradigmatic examples reveals these to be idealizations of\nactual kinds. Special-science kind-terms are thus typically ambiguous.\nSometimes a given term refers to an actual but realization-restricted\nkind. Other times it refers to features of explanatory but non-actual\nidealized models. (Klein 2008 illustrates this ambiguity with his\ndetailed example from materials science.) Neither suffices to provide\na kind of actual multiple realization that the standard argument\nrequires. However, he insists that his argument isn\u2019t entirely\nnegative for non-reductive physicalism. Idealizations can function in\nexplanations that are autonomous in an important sense from lower\nlevel sciences. And furthermore, Klein argues, Jaegwon Kim\u2019s\n(1992) assumption that\nall explanatory work in science must appeal to realization-restricted\nkinds and properties (discussed in\n \u00a72\n above), is simply incorrect. Still, Klein insists, there appear to be\nno actual and projectable\u2014hence genuinely\nscientific\u2014multiple realized kinds.\n\nBickle (2010) questions whether the \u201csecond-wave\u201d of\ncriticisms of the standard argument, those that challenge the multiple\nrealization premise itself (discussed in\n \u00a72.4\n and this section above), give aid and comfort to psychoneural\nreductionists. Since psychoneural reductionism was one of the explicit\ntargets of the standard multiple realization argument, one might\nplausibly assume that they do. Yet none of those who offer these\n\u201csecond-wave\u201d challenges (Shapiro, Polger, Couch) identify\nthemselves as \u201creductionists\u201d (with the possible exception\nof Shapiro, and more recently Bechtel 2009, although his response to\nthe multiple realization argument figures nowhere in his plumb for\n\u201cmechanistic reduction\u201d). Some of these\n\u201csecond-wave\u201d critics, such as Polger 2004, are explicitly\nanti-reductionist. (Though Polger 2004 is also explicitly\nanti-anti-reduction. He argues that multiple realization has little if\nanything to do with reduction.) This fact alone should give a\npsychoneural reductionist pause. Second, the direction that the\nsecond-wave debates have developed, starting with Gillett\u2019s\n(2003) criticisms\u2014deeply into the nature of the realization\nrelation, and so deeply into the metaphysics of science rather than\ninto science itself\u2014should prompt the psychoneural reductionist\nwith a metascientific bent to simply tell the second-wavers, thanks\nfor nothing! Does that leave psychoneural reductionism back on its\nheels, in light of the standard multiple realization argument? Not at\nall, Bickle (2010) insists. For the \u201cfirst-wave\u201d\nactual-scientific-history challenge to the first premise of the\nstandard argument, and the initial critical discussions (see\n \u00a72.1,\n \u00a72.2, and\n \u00a72.5\n above) turns out never to have been rejoined by anti-reductionists.\nWhy not? Bickle speculates that metaphysics was the culprit.\nNon-reductive physicalists seem to have assumed that by rejoining\narguments of metaphysicans like Kim (1992), they thereby dismissed the\nentire first-wave of challenges. Many of the challenges discussed in\n section 2\n above shows that this is not the case. There are numerous examples of\nmultiply realized kinds that are components of scientific theories\nwidely acknowledged to having been reduced to other theories. So\nmultiple realization alone is no barrier to actual scientific\nreduction. The detailed scientific cases that illuminate many of those\n\u201cfirst-wave\u201d challenge to the standard multiple\nrealizability argument remain unanswered to this day.\n\nSo well into the second decade of the new millennium, a renewed\ncritical interest in multiple realizability continued to generate new\ndiscussions and arguments on both sides, pro and can. The assumption,\nunfortunately still too common in philosophy of mind, that multiple\nrealizability \u201cseals the deal\u201d against reductive\nphysicalism and mind-brain identity theory, was mistaken back in the\n1970s and 1980s (see\n \u00a72\n above), and grew even more discredited by the full scope of published\nliterature on the topic that has followed since. But equally\nunfortunately, the literature on multiple realizability had taken off\nin numerous varied directions, and following out any one of these\nleads one quickly into detailed complicated and technical discussions,\nin both philosophy and science, and often at quite a distance from\nthose who follow out arguments in other directions. And the fate of\none of the most influential arguments in late-twentieth century\nAnglo-American philosophy hangs in the balance, in all of these\ndebates. By the second decade of the new millennium, concerns about\nmultiple realizability arguments had grown beyond their philosophy of\nmind origins, into more general questions about relationships\nobtaining between sciences addressing higher and lower levels of the\nworld\u2019s organization. What the issue needed now was a single\nwork that captured both the full scope of writings on this topic, and\nwith a focus unifying all of these diverging literatures. Fortunately,\nsuch a work appeared, and it and its critical reception is the focus\non the next section.\n",
