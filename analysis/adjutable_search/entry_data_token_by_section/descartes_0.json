    "main_text": "Intellectual Biography || Early life and education\n1.1 Early life and education\n\nDescartes was born on 31 March 1596 in his maternal\ngrandmother\u2019s house in La Haye, in the Touraine region of\nFrance. His father Joachim, a lawyer who lived in Ch\u00e2tellerault\n(22 kilometers southwest of La Haye, across the Creuse River in the\nPoitou region), was away at the Parliament of Brittany in Rennes. The\ntown of La Haye, which lies 47 kilometers south of Tours, has\nsubsequently been renamed Descartes.\n\nWhen Descartes was thirteen and one-half months old, his mother,\nJeanne Brochard, died in childbirth. The young Ren\u00e9 spent his\nearly years with his grandmother, Jeanne Sain Brochard, in La Haye,\ntogether with his older brother Pierre and older sister Jeanne. It is\nlikely that he then moved to the house of his great uncle, Michel\nFerrand, who, like many of Ren\u00e9\u2019s male relatives, was a\nlawyer; he was a Counselor to the King and held the royal office of\nprovincial Lieutenant General in Ch\u00e2tellerault. When Descartes\nmet Isaac Beeckman in 1618, he introduced himself as\n\u201cPoitevin,\u201d or from Poitou (10:46, 51\u20134;\nRodis-Lewis 1998, 3, 26; see also 2:642). At this time (and\nnow and again later on), he also signed letters as \u201cdu\nPerron\u201d and called himself \u201csieur du Perron\u201d (Lord\nof Perron), after a small farm in Poitou he inherited from his\nmother\u2019s family (Watson 2007, 81, 230). But he did not neglect\nhis birthplace in La Haye: in a letter of 1649, he described himself\nas \u201ca man who was born in the gardens of Touraine\u201d\n(5:349).\n\nIn 1606 or 1607, Descartes, a Roman Catholic, entered the newly\nfounded Jesuit College of La Fl\u00e8che, where he remained until\n1614 or 1615. He followed the usual course of studies, which included\nfive or six years of grammar school, including Latin and Greek\ngrammar, classical poets, and Cicero, followed by three years of\nphilosophy curriculum. By rule, the Jesuit philosophy curriculum\nfollowed Aristotle; it was divided into the then-standard topics of\nlogic, morals, physics, and metaphysics. The Jesuits also included\nmathematics in the final three years of study.\n\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy was taught through textbooks and printed\ncommentaries on his works. Aristotle himself frequently discussed the\npositions of his ancient predecessors. The most extensive commentaries\nalso elaborated in some detail on positions other than\nAristotle\u2019s. Within this framework, and taking into account the\nreading of Cicero, Descartes would have been exposed in school to the\ndoctrines of the ancient atomists, Plato, and the Stoics, and he would\nhave heard of the skeptics. Further, important intellectual events\nwere celebrated at La Fl\u00e8che, including Galileo\u2019s\ndiscovery of the moons of Jupiter in 1610. Although scholastic\nAristotelian philosophy was dominant in Descartes\u2019 school years,\nit was not the only philosophy that he knew.\n\nFamously, Descartes wrote in the autobiographical portion of the\nDiscourse (1637) that, when he left school, \u201cI found\nmyself beset by so many doubts and errors that I came to think I had\ngained nothing from my attempts to become educated but increasing\nrecognition of my ignorance\u201d (6:4). And yet, he continued, he\ndid not \u201ccease to value the exercises done in the schools\u201d\n(6:5), for languages, fables, oratory, poetry, mathematics, morals,\ntheology, and philosophy all had their value, as did jurisprudence,\nmedicine, and other sciences (including engineering) that serve as\nprofessions and which one might study after attending a school such as\nLa Fl\u00e8che. He noted the contradiction and disagreement that\nbeset philosophy and so infected the higher sciences (including\nmedicine) \u201cinsofar as they borrow their principles from\nphilosophy\u201d (6:8). A year later, in 1638, he told an inquiring\nfather that \u201cnowhere on earth is philosophy taught better than\nat La Fl\u00e8che,\u201d where he advised his correspondent to send\nhis son even if he wanted him subsequently to transcend the learning\nof the schools\u2014while also suggesting that the son might study at\nUtrecht with Henry le Roy, a disciple of Descartes (2:378\u20139).\nAccording to the Discourse, it was not surprising that\nphilosophy as taught at La Fl\u00e8che was uncertain: it had to be,\nsince he (Descartes) was now offering a first glimpse of the one true\nphilosophy, only recently discovered. Until it could be promulgated,\nLa Fl\u00e8che, or another good school, would do.\n\nHis family wanted Descartes to be a lawyer, like his father and other\nrelatives. To this end, he obtained a law degree from Poitiers in\n1616. But he never practiced law or entered into the governmental\nservice that such practice would have made possible (Rodis-Lewis 1998,\n18\u201322). Instead, he became a gentleman soldier, moving in 1618\nto Breda, to support the Protestant Prince Maurice against the\nCatholic parts of the Netherlands (which later constituted Belgium),\nwhich were controlled by Spain\u2014a Catholic land, like France, but\nat this point an enemy.\n",
