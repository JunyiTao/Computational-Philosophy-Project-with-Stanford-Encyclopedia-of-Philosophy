    "main_text": "The Value of Personal Relationship Goods || Primary Goods as Necessary for the Two Moral Powers\n3.6 Primary Goods as Necessary for the Two Moral Powers\n\nSome philosophers (Brake 2017; Cordelli 2015a) claim that certain\npersonal relationship goods are akin to Rawlsian primary goods because\nthey are necessary to develop the two moral powers of persons: a sense\nof justice and the capacity for a conception of the good. If so, this\nis a second Rawlsian argument for them. It appears different from the\nargument in the previous section, since some goods may be all-purpose,\nyet not strictly necessary for developing the two moral powers (for\nexample, money).\n\nIn this sense, one way in which some personal relationships goods are\nrelevant is because of their role in self-formation and, more or less\ndirectly, in the acquisition of self-respect. Not only care ethicists\n(Held 1993), but also contemporary philosophers influenced by Hegel\nhave noted this; the latter elaborated on the Hegelian idea that we\ngain self-consciousness only through a process of mutual recognition.\nThis insight has been applied to various contexts. The child\u2019s\nsubjectivity is shaped within her the relationship with her primary\ncare-givers\u2014including her identity alongside various categories\nsuch as gender and her future (in)ability to relate to others as\nequals, in non-dominating ways (Benjamin 1988). Through relationships\nin which they receive other people\u2019s recognition, individuals\ngain self-confidence, self-respect and self-esteem (Honneth 1992,\n1995: ch. 5). If this is correct, and if the social bases of\nself-respect is a primary good\u2014as Rawls (1971) definitely\nbelieved\u2014this is another reason to think that access to some\npersonal relationship goods is a matter of justice.\n\nWithin analytical political philosophy, Brake (2017) noted that the\ngoods uniquely created by caring relationships are usually necessary\nat all stages of life in order to exercise the two moral\npowers. This is very likely, given their role in maintaining mental\nhealth; but perhaps even when personal relationship goods are not\nnecessary for mental health, they are required for maintaining as\nsense of justice and revising life plans, as suggested by\nCordelli:\n\n\nmany relational resources should count as primary goods \u2026\nbecause they secure those conditions of support, stability, and the\nself-confidence that foster the development and maintenance of the\nfirst moral power over time. Further, relational resources also play a\nrelevant role in helping individuals revise their life plans.\n(Cordelli 2015a: 97)\n\n",
