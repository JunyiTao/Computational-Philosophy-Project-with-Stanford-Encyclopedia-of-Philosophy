    "main_text": "Value Creation || Nietzsche\u2019s Meta-ethical Stance and the Nature of Value Creation\n3.1 Nietzsche\u2019s Meta-ethical Stance and the Nature of Value Creation\n\nNietzsche\u2019s talk about the creation of values challenges\nphilosophical common sense. It is common, if not altogether standard,\nto explain values by contrasting them against mere\ndesires. Both are positive attitudes toward some object or\nstate of affairs (\u201cpro-attitudes\u201d), but valuing seems to\ninvolve an element of objectivity absent in desiring. (Consider: If I\nbecome convinced that something I valued is not in fact valuable, that\ndiscovery is normally sufficient to provoke me to revise my value,\nsuggesting that valuing must be responsive to the world; by contrast,\nsubjective desires often persist even in the face of my judgment that\ntheir objects are not properly desirable, or are unattainable; see the\nentries on\n value theory\n and\n desire.)\n Nietzsche challenges this basic philosophical conception when he\ntreats value as \u201ccreated\u201d rather than discovered in the\nworld:\n\n\nWe [contemplatives] \u2026 are those who really continually\nfashion something that had not been there before: the whole\neternally growing world of valuations, colors, accents, perspectives,\nscales, affirmations, and negations. \u2026 Whatever has\nvalue in our world now does not have value in itself,\naccording to its nature\u2014nature is always value-less\u2014but\nhas been given value at some time, as a present\u2014and it\nwas we who gave and bestowed it. Only we have created the\nworld that concerns man! (GS 301; see also\nGS 78, 109, 139, 143, 276, 289, 290, 299; Z I, 17,\n22, II, 20, III, 12; BGE 203, 211, 260, 261, 285; TI\nIX, 9, 24, 49)\n\n\nPassages like GS 301 have an unmistakable subjectivist\nflavor, tracing value to some source in our own attitudes and/or\nagency, but it is a difficult question how this subjectivist strand of\nNietzsche\u2019s thought is to be reconciled with his ubiquitous (and\nuncompromising, unqualified) insistence that his own value judgments\nare correct and those he opposes are false, or even rest on\nlies. Some scholars take the value creation passages as evidence that\nNietzsche was an anti-realist about value, so that his confident\nevaluative judgments should be read as efforts at rhetorical\npersuasion rather than objective claims (Leiter 2015), or (relatedly)\nthey suggest that Nietzsche could fruitfully be read as a skeptic, so\nthat such passages should be evaluated primarily for their practical\neffect on readers (Berry 2011, 2019; see also Leiter 2014). Such\nskeptical readings have been thoughtfully challenged by Huddleston\n(2014). Others (Hussain 2007) take Nietzsche to be advocating a\nfictionalist posture, according to which values are self-consciously\ninvented contributions to a pretense through which we can satisfy our\nneeds as valuing creatures, even though all evaluative claims are\n(strictly speaking) false. Still others (Richardson 2004; Reginster\n2006; Anderson 2005, 2009; Silk 2015, 2018) are tempted to suppose\nthat Nietzsche\u2019s talk of \u201ccreation\u201d is meant to\nsuggest one or another form of \u201cconstructivism,\u201d according\nto which value claims are \u201cattitude-dependent\u201d in some\ndefinite respect that requires careful specification, or\n\u201csubjective realism\u201d\u2014a view according to which\nvalues have some basis in subjective attitudes of valuing, but\nnevertheless also gain some kind of objective standing in the\nworld once those attitudes have done their work and\n\u201ccreated\u201d the values.\n\nNietzsche\u2019s meta-ethical stance is treated elsewhere (see\nSection 3 of the entry on\n Nietzsche\u2019s moral and political philosophy),\n but even aside from the meta-ethical status of \u201ccreated\u201d\nvalues, the very idea of \u201cvalue creation\u201d is challenging\nto understand. This continues to be a very active area of research,\nwith quite different recent accounts appearing in Richardson (2020:\n439\u201374), Clark (2015b), Dries (2015), and others. In lieu of a\nfuller discussion, here are three textual observations. First, while a\nfew passages appear to offer a conception of value creation as some\nkind of legislative fiat (e.g., BGE 211), such a view is hard\nto reconcile with the dominant strand of passages, which presents\nvalue creation as a difficult achievement characterized by substantial\nworldly constraints and significant exposure to luck, rather than\nsomething that could be done at will. Second, a great many of the\npassages (esp. GS 78, 107, 290, 299, 301) connect value\ncreation to artistic creation, suggesting that Nietzsche took artistic\ncreation and aesthetic value as an important paradigm or model for his\naccount of values and value creation more generally. While some (Soll\n2001) attack this entire idea as confused, other scholars have called\non these passages as support for either fictionalist or subjective\nrealist interpretations. In addition, Huddleston (2019) shows that\ninvestigations into the creation of artistic and cultural value with\nreal intersubjective purchase was utterly central to Nietzsche\u2019s\nvery conception of philosophy and its proper ambitions. Progress in\nthis area is likely to come from careful interrogation of\nNietzsche\u2019s conception of artistic creation itself. Finally,\nNietzsche\u2019s account of \u201crevaluation\u201d remains an\nunderstudied source of examples for what he might mean by \u201cvalue\ncreation\u201d. After all, the moral revaluation achieved by the\n\u201cslave revolt in morality\u201d (see\n section 2)\n is presented as a creation of new values (GM I, 10, et\npassim). In addition to showing that not all value creation leads\nto results that Nietzsche would endorse, this observation leads to\ninteresting questions\u2014e.g., Did Nietzsche hold that all value\ncreation operates via revaluation (as suggested, perhaps, by\nGM II, 12\u201313)? Or is \u201cvalue creation ex\nnihilo\u201d also supposed to be a possibility? If so, what\ndifferentiates the two modes? Can we say anything about which is to be\npreferred? etc.\n",
