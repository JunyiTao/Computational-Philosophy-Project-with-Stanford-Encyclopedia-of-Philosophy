    "main_text": "The Soul || The Simplicity of the Soul\n7.4 The Simplicity of the Soul\n\nAccording to William, souls are among the simplest of created\nsubstances. Nevertheless, like all created substances, they must\ninvolve some kind of composition. This composition cannot be a bodily\ncomposition, of course, since they are not bodies and thus cannot be\ndivided into bodily parts. According to Avicebron, as well as some of\nWilliam\u2019s contemporaries, souls are composite in the sense that\nthey are composites of form and matter, though not a matter that\ninvolves physical dimensions, but rather what some called\n\u201cspiritual matter.\u201d This view is part of the doctrine now\ntermed \u201cuniversal hylomorphism,\u201d according to which every\ncreated substance is a composite of form and matter (see Weisheipl\n1979). William is one of the first to reject this doctrine; he is\nlater followed by Aquinas. In support of his rejection, in On the\nUniverse he makes one of his rare references to Averroes, citing\nwith approval his claim that prime matter is a potentiality only of\nperceptible substances and hence is not found in spiritual substances.\nHe also argues that there is no need to posit matter in angels or\nsouls in order to explain their receptivity in cognition, as some had\nthought necessary (OO I, 851b-852b). Rather, souls and other spiritual\nsubstances are \u201cpure immaterial forms\u201d without matter.\n\nWilliam also denies a real plurality of powers in the soul. He holds\ninstead that each power of the soul is identical with the soul and not\na part of it. When we speak of a power of the soul, we are really\nspeaking of the soul considered as the source or cause of a certain\nkind of operation. Thus, the power to understand characteristic of a\nhuman or rational soul is the soul considered as a source or cause of\nthe operation of understanding.\n\nWhat sort of composition, then, is to be found in souls and other\nspiritual beings? William holds that every being other than God\n\nis in a certain sense composed of that which is (quod est)\nand of that by which it is (quo est) or its being or entity\n\u2026 since being or entity accrues and comes to each thing apart\nfrom its completed substance and account. The exception is the first\nprinciple, to which alone [being] is essential and one with it in the\nultimate degree of unity. (OO I, 852a)\n\n\nHere William uses Boethius\u2019s language of quod est and\nquo est to make the point that in souls, as in all created\nsubstances, there is, to use Avicennian terms, a composition of being\nand essence, a doctrine to be developed by Aquinas.\n",
