Empiricism and the Attack on Nativism: Locke and Hume\n\n\nThe modern debate about innateness really begins with\nLocke\u2019s polemic against innate principles and innate ideas in the\nopening chapters of his Essay Concerning Human Understanding, which\nhappens to also be the founding document of modern Empiricism.\nThe point of the polemic is to delegitimize innateness as a candidate\nexplanation of our knowledge and understanding, and to thereby leave\nthe field to the Empiricist account that is developed in the rest of\nthe Essay. The thrust of Locke\u2019s arguments is\ntwo-fold: first, that the facts Nativists cite in favor of their views\nare not facts at all; second, that even if the facts were granted for\nthe sake of argument, Empiricist accounts are preferable, because they\nare simpler. The simplicity resides in the fact that both parties\naccept a role for experience in knowledge acquisition.\nEmpiricists presume there is only experience; Nativists think\nthere is experience plus innate principles and ideas. If we can\naccount for knowledge without innate ideas, principles, and so on, the\nEmpiricist wins. Given the logic of the situation as Locke\nunderstands it, the whole polemical negative attack on\ninnateness is almost beside the point. The real epistemological\nprize he is after can only be won by providing a satisfactory\npositive innateness-free account of how knowledge is produced\nfrom experience. But Locke is probably right in thinking that his\nEmpiricist doctrines will be more convincing if there is no Nativist\nalternative to challenge them.\n\n\nWhy, according to Locke, is Nativism not only unnecessary but\nillegitimate? One prominent theme is that if there were innate\nprinciples in the mind \u2013 his example is Whatsoever is,\nis \u2013 we would be aware of them, and they would therefore be\nuniversally assented to. But, he argues, children and idiots cannot\neven make sense of such claims, let alone assent to them.  He goes on\nto argue that various fallback positions \u2013 assent when they\nunderstand, assent when they begin to reason, capacity to assent under\nappropriate conditions \u2013 all reduce the claim to a sort of\ntriviality. The upshot is that innateness is either a real alternative\nto Empiricism but obviously false, or trivially true but not\nincompatible with Empiricism.\n\n\nUnderlying much of Locke\u2019s attack is the Cartesian view that\nto claim something is \u2018in the mind\u2019, innately or not, is to\ngive it a place in our conscious awareness. Leibniz\u2019s bold\nhypothesis of non-conscious mental states would, if successful, sweep\naside most of Locke\u2019s arguments against innateness. But we\nneed to keep in mind that the polemics in the Essay, though they were\nhistorically influential, are almost a sideshow. The real issue\nis whether the Empiricist can construct a satisfactory account of human\nknowledge without adverting to any innate ideas and principles.\nTo meet this challenge, Locke (and to an even greater extent Hume)\noffered what may be termed adequacy of the stimulus\ncounterarguments. Locke constructs a theory of experience\n(perception and reflection) as the source of all our ideas, sketches an\naccount of the mental faculties that can be brought to bear on these\nideas, and applies these materials to our ideas of infinity, number,\nspace, substance, our understanding of general principles of causality,\nand so on. These were the abstract ideas and principles that\nRationalists had claimed could not be derived from perceptual\nexperience. Locke wants to demonstrate that such ideas and\nprinciples can be acquired without the need for any innate\n\u2018pre-seeding\u2019. Locke believes that the key to\nintelligibility and understanding lies in a proper appreciation of what\nour faculty of Reason can accomplish when set to work on the ideas\nreceived in our experience.\n\n\nIn considering Locke\u2019s execution of this plan in the Essay we\ndiscover a trend that grows stronger in subsequent Empiricist thinkers\nlike Hume and his 19th and 20th century\nsuccessors. One can be easily misled into thinking that there was\na general agreement on both sides of this controversy about the\nexplanandum: we can call that our understanding, or simply the\nintelligibility of the world. The innateness controversy would\nthen be about which theory can provide the best explanation of this\nagreed-upon \u2018Understanding\u2019. But this positivistic\nparadigm of the dynamics of theory-selection does not fit the real\ndebate. A Kuhnian perspective is closer to the truth.\nEmpiricists inevitably reconfigured the explanandum \u2013 some\nelements of the original explanandum were to be (better)\nexplained by the Empiricist account, but a good deal of it was\nto be explained away as Rationalist over-reaching. Our\nearlier example of Descartes\u2019 a priori claim that matter\ncannot think is a case in point. Locke\u2019s system was\ncriticized for not being able to exclude the possibility of thinking\nmatter. But for Locke, that possibility was not excludable,\ndespite Descartes\u2019 clear and distinct perception to the\ncontrary. So Locke does not accept the explanatory burden of\nproviding an Empiricist account of how it is that the Understanding\ngrasps the falsity of materialism and the truth of dualism. Our\nknowledge of the world does not extend as far as the Rationalist\nthinks, and the true explanatory burden is therefore lighter\nthan the Rationalist makes it out to be. This pattern of\nexplaining away reaches its culmination in Hume, who sees more\nclearly than Locke that the fact that the mind can make the world\nintelligible is itself a philosophical presumption that needs to be\nexplained away. Hume replaces it with a naturalistic account of\nhow we track the way the world appears to us, and collate the results\nto guide us in the future. Our understanding of the world, in\nHume\u2019s philosophy, is thinned out into something the Rationalists\nwould not count as Understanding at all; his conception of human reason\nis, appropriately enough, a pale shadow of their Reason.\n\n\nThe doctrinally pure(r) Empiricism that we find in Hume also\ncontains a surprising twist for the innateness doctrine. The\nalternative to innateness, at least in Locke\u2019s shorthand form, is\nthat ideas come via the senses from the world outside us. But it\ncan be argued that Hume\u2019s Empiricism has no room for thinking of\na world outside us, and certainly not for ideas as copies of properties\nof things or as caused by things in that world (a point also stressed\nby the other prominent British Empiricist, Bishop Berkeley).\nHume, perhaps a bit tongue-in-cheek, tells us that the innateness\ndebate is totally wrong-headed and that as he sees it, all our\nimpressions are innate, in that they are original to the\n mind.[7]\nAlong these\nlines, one can argue that for Hume, innateness is a red herring.\nWhat matters to Empiricism is not the history of ideas in the mind and\nthe before or after, but the nature of those ideas.\nSpecifically, what\u2019s foundationally important for Humean\nEmpiricism is not anti-Nativism, but what we might call\nexperientialism, the thesis that all our ideas are\nrepresentations of particular sensory states. We can\nsummarize this and say they must be \u2018copies of\nexperiences\u2019, but for Hume, it has no philosophical import if we\none day learn how to tinker with a fetus to produce in its mind an\n\u2018innate\u2019 representation of the taste of chocolate.\nWhat counts is that the idea produced be experiential in the right\nsense. For Hume we will never be able to tinker away to produce\nan abstract idea of causal power, because there is no such\nidea \u2013 all ideas are experiential or constructs of such.\n(These points, I think, can explain why Hume is so cavalier about the\nfamous missing shade of blue that seems to not be copied from\nexperience \u2013 i.e., because it is still an experiential\n idea.)[8]\n",
