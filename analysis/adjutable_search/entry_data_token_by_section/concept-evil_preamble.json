    "main_text": "\n\nSince World War II, moral, political, and legal philosophers have\nbecome increasingly interested in the concept of evil. This interest\nhas been partly motivated by ascriptions of \u2018evil\u2019 by\nlaymen, social scientists, journalists, and politicians as they try to\nunderstand and respond to various atrocities and horrors, such as\ngenocides, terrorist attacks, mass murders, and tortures and killing\nsprees by psychopathic serial killers. It seems that we cannot capture\nthe moral significance of these actions and their perpetrators by\ncalling them \u2018wrong\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 or even\n\u2018very very wrong\u2019 or \u2018very very bad.\u2019 We need\nthe concept of evil.\n\nTo avoid confusion, it is important to note that there are at least\ntwo concepts of evil: a broad concept and a narrow concept. The broad\nconcept picks out any bad state of affairs, wrongful action, or\ncharacter flaw. The suffering of a toothache is evil in the broad\nsense as is a harmless lie. Evil in the broad sense has been\ndivided into two categories: natural evil and moral evil. Natural\nevils are bad states of affairs which do not result from the\nintentions or negligence of moral agents. Hurricanes and toothaches\nare examples of natural evils. By contrast, moral evils do result from\nthe intentions or negligence of moral agents. Murder and lying are\nexamples of moral evils.\n\nEvil in the broad sense, which includes all natural and moral evils,\ntends to be the sort of evil referenced in theological contexts, such\nas in discussions of the problem of evil. The problem of evil is the\nproblem of accounting for evil in a world created by an all-powerful,\nall-knowing, all-good God. It seems that if the creator has these\nattributes, there would be no evil in the world. But there is evil in\nthe world. Thus, there is reason to believe that an all-powerful,\nall-knowing, all-good creator does not exist.\n\nIn contrast to the broad concept of evil, the narrow concept of evil\npicks out only the most morally despicable sorts of actions,\ncharacters, events, etc. As Marcus Singer puts it\n\u201c\u2018evil\u2019 [in this sense] \u2026 is the worst\npossible term of opprobrium imaginable\u201d (Singer 2004, 185).\nSince the narrow concept of evil involves moral condemnation, it is\nappropriately ascribed only to moral agents and their actions. For\nexample, if only human beings are moral agents, then only human beings\ncan perform evil actions. Evil in this narrower sense is more often\nmeant when the term \u2018evil\u2019 is used in contemporary moral,\npolitical, and legal contexts. This entry will focus on evil in this\nnarrower sense. The entry will not discuss evil in the broad sense or\nthe problem of evil to any significant degree (these topics will be\ndiscussed briefly only in section 2).\n\nThe main issues discussed by philosophers on the topic of evil have\nbeen: Should we use the term \u2018evil\u2019 in our moral,\npolitical, and legal discourse and thinking, or is evil an out-dated\nor empty concept which should be abandoned? What is the relationship\nbetween evil and other moral concepts such as badness and wrongdoing?\nWhat are the necessary and sufficient conditions for evil action? What\nare the necessary and sufficient conditions for evil character? What\nis the relationship between evil action and evil character? What types\nof evil actions and characters can exist? What is the proper analysis\nof derivative concepts such as evil institution?\n\nThis entry gives an overview of answers to these questions found in\nthe literature.\n",
