    "main_text": "Ethics and Ethical Theory || General Considerations\n3.1 General Considerations\n\nAs a Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist, \u015a\u0101ntideva advises\npractitioners to adopt the Awakening Mind (Sanskrit\nbodhicitta), the altruistic intention to become a Buddha and\nthen remain in cyclic existence for the benefit of others until all\nsentient beings have been saved from suffering. Someone who adopts the\nAwakening Mind is thereafter known as a bodhisattva, a being in the\nprocess of waking up. \u015a\u0101ntideva expresses his own commitment\nto the Awakening Mind in a justly famous verse, BCA X.55:\n\u201cAs long as space abides and as long as the world abides, so\nlong may I abide, destroying the sufferings of the world\u201d. The\nwhole of BCA III focuses on the Awakening Mind from two\npoints of view. First, the chapter expresses thoughts and sentiments\nthat might be experienced by someone who was taking up the Awakening\nMind for the first time. The second, shorter portion of BCA\nIII is a soaring evocation of the value and importance of this quality\nof the mind and heart. This chapter contains some of the finest\nBuddhist poetry ever written:\n\n\nIII. 27. As a blind man might find a jewel in heaps of rubbish, so too\nthis Awakening Mind has somehow appeared in me.\n\n28. This is the elixir of life, born to end death in the world. This\nis the inexhaustible treasure, alleviating poverty in the world.\n\n29. This is the supreme medicine, curing the sickness of the world, a\ntree of shelter for weary creatures staggering along the road of\nexistence;\n\n30. The causeway to cross over bad rebirths, open to all who travel.\nIt is the rising moon of the mind, mitigating the defilements of the\nworld.\n\n31. It is the brilliant sun, dispelling the mist of ignorance from the\nworld. It is the fresh butter risen up from churning the milk of the\ntrue Dharma.\n\n32. For the caravan of humanity traveling the road of existence,\nhungry for the enjoyment of happiness, this is a feast of happiness\noffered as refreshment to all who approach.\n\n33ab. Today I summon the world to Buddhahood and, meanwhile, to\nhappiness. (translation slightly altered from C&S: 22)\n\n\nFor \u015a\u0101ntideva, as for other Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhists,\nthe spiritual path that is shaped and motivated by the Awakening Mind\ninvolves the cultivation of six crucial qualities or virtues known as\nthe Perfections (or perhaps \u201cTranscendences\u201d, Sanskrit\np\u0101ramit\u0101). This well-known list has great\nimportance for \u015a\u0101ntideva, as it provides the main structural\nframework for the organization of the BCA; members of the\nlist also occur in the titles of four of the chapters of the\n\u015aS. The six perfections are:\n\nThe Perfection of Generosity\n(d\u0101na-p\u0101ramit\u0101)\nThe Perfection of Moral Discipline\n(\u015b\u012bla-p\u0101ramit\u0101)\nThe Perfection of Patient Endurance\n(k\u1e63\u0101nti-p\u0101ramit\u0101)\nThe Perfection of Perseverance\n(v\u012brya-p\u0101ramit\u0101)\nThe Perfection of Meditative Stability\n(dhy\u0101na-p\u0101ramit\u0101)\nThe Perfection of wisdom\n(praj\u00f1\u0101-p\u0101ramit\u0101)\n\n\n\u015a\u0101ntideva regards generosity as having a crucial role in the\nbodhisattva path, and his interpretation of generosity is quite\ndemanding and rigorous, as indeed is the case for many of our\npremodern Buddhist sources. He extols the transcendent generosity of\nthose bodhisattvas of the past who were willing to sacrifice parts of\ntheir own body, even at grave risk to their own lives, in order to\nrelieve the suffering of others and advance their own spiritual\ndevelopment. According to \u015a\u0101ntideva, though, the true\nperfection of generosity is a mental attitude that consists in the\nrenunciation of the very idea of owning anything. At \u015aS\n18\u201319, he quotes the Vows of Individual Liberation for\nBodhisattvas as teaching that \u201ca bodhisattva thinks of\neverything as belonging to someone else, and doesn\u2019t own\nanything. Why? Because ownership is fear\u201d (SS-G: 22; and see\nBCA V.10). \n\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s understanding of the Perfection of Patient\nEndurance, as discussed in BCA VI and in ch. 10 of the\n\u015aS, is of great philosophical interest. Like many\nBuddhists, \u015a\u0101ntideva rejects the common-sense view that\nanger is often an appropriate response to the failings and\ntransgressions of others. Instead, he holds several radical theses\nabout anger: that anger is gravely spiritually and psychologically\ndamaging to the one who succumbs to it; that anger always involves\ncertain conceptual mistakes; and that it is therefore urgent to\ncounteract anger through meditative exercises.\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s clear and uncompromising advocacy of the\nelimination of anger has been fruitfully compared to the views of\ncertain Hellenistic philosophers (see, e.g., Gowans 2010). His reasons\nfor thinking that anger necessarily involves conceptual error will be\nbriefly explained below. \n\nIn her monograph on the \u015aS, Suzanne Mrozik has\nemphasized the somatic dimension of that text\u2019s normative\nperspective. For Buddhists such as \u015a\u0101ntideva, moral\nexcellence must be attained through rigorous practices of bodily\ndiscipline. Some of these belong to monastic etiquette and training;\nothers are forms of mindfulness of body; and others are aspects of\nmeditation practice. Moreover, s\u016btra texts quoted by\n\u015a\u0101ntideva claim that Buddhist devotional practices and the\npreservation of moral discipline will lead to an attractive, healthy\nand beautiful body. Mrozik sees much potential in these teachings,\nwhich emphasize aspects of moral practice that modern writers often\noverlook. Yet we might be concerned that a literal reading of\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s views about the causes of physical\nattractiveness could lead healthy and handsome people to a quite\nunwarranted sense of superiority, while licensing contempt for, or\neven discrimination against, the ugly or the disabled.\n\nAs Barbra Clayton has shown, the description of the\nbodhisattva\u2019s way of life in the \u015aS features an\ninteresting perspective on the role of pu\u1e47ya,\n\u201cgoodness\u201d or \u201cgood karma\u201d. Early Buddhist\ntexts appear to take the view that the Saint (Sanskrit arhat)\nstops creating karmic traces, whether good or bad, as a result of her\nexperience of liberation. These karmic traces function to project\nhappy or unhappy future experiences in cyclic existence; and a Saint,\nwho is free of cyclic existence, must therefore have left goodness\nbehind, along with the vile actions that lead to misery.\n\u015a\u0101ntideva, on the other hand, sees even quite advanced\nbodhisattvas as committed to the ongoing cultivation of goodness, not\nfor their own sake, but in order to transfer it to other sentient\nbeings and thereby sustain their progress towards spiritual maturity\n(see Clayton 2006: 76\u201388). \n\nAnother feature of \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s presentation of\nBuddhist ethics that is not commonly encountered in similar texts is\nthe emphasis he places in the \u015aS on the interdependent\nand mutually supportive nature of the various Buddhist virtues. So,\nfor example, he writes at \u015aS 289 that \u201cyou should\nundertake to increase goodness through effort, intention, and\ncompassion, which stabilize each other\u201d. And at \u015aS\n121 we find a passage, also in \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s own voice,\nthat could be rendered: \u201cMoral discipline and stable attention\nreinforce each other. The two together make it possible to embrace\nexperience completely\u201d (see SS-G: 119 and 273). \n\nThe fact that \u015a\u0101ntideva sees the various Buddhist virtues as\nmutually supportive may help to explain why he devotes so little\ntheoretical attention to resolving conflicts between different\nBuddhist values. If they all work together and reinforce each other,\nsuch conflicts would be merely theoretical and would have little\npractical importance. \n",
