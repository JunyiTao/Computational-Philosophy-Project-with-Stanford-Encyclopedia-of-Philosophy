This suggests that he too is really interested, not\nso much in what seeing is, as in what one can\u2019t doubt.\n(1962: 104\u20135)\n\n\nAustin overlooks Price\u2019s most important point here, which is\nthat he is certain that what is given to him is something red, that\nis, something with that property. Price\u2019s interest here is what\nthe real character of the component of experience is, and his remark\ndoes not reveal his more general interest in doubt and certainty.\nPrice needs some genuine feature so that in the light of what he can\nalso know about the surrounding objects he can argue that the given\nitems are not surfaces of external things. The main problem with\nPrice\u2019s claim is that he has no good response to the\ncounter-proposal that all he can really be certain of is that the\npresented thing looks red. Despite talking about what he can\ndoubt, Price\u2019s main concern is what seeing involves.\n\nHe does elsewhere respond to what he calls the Theory of Appearing\n(1932: 61\u201365; for discussion: Langsam 1997: 36; Murray 1933:\n508\u2013513), which he takes to be a modification of na\u00efve\nrealism, and which in effect says that when we see the tomato it is\nnot certain that there is a red thing, but it is merely certain that\nthere appears to be a red thing. Clearly, this suggestion\nundermines the central argument from illusion, since the external\nobject can also count as appearing to be red; so no non-identity claim\ncan be generated (1932: 62).\n\nPrice\u2019s main response is that either \u201cX looks\nred\u201d means \u201cX presents a red sense-datum\u201d in\nwhich case there is a red sense-datum (1932: 63; 1964a: 15ff), or,\n\u201cderivatively\u201d (1964a: 15), it means something like\n\u201cI am inclined to think that X is red\u201d or\n\u201cthere is some probability (though not certainty) that X\nis red\u201d or is used to avoid being accused of being mistaken if\nX isn\u2019t red, in which cases it does not capture an\nexperiential fact (1932: 62\u201365; 1964a: 12\u201315). The obvious\nproblem with this objection is why those are the only alternative ways\nto understand looks judgements. However, see 1952a: passim,\nwhere he discusses appearing further, Quinton\u2019s (1952:\n238\u2013246) detailed criticisms, and Grossmann\u2019s (1965:\n35\u201338) sympathetic use of Price\u2019s response.\n",
