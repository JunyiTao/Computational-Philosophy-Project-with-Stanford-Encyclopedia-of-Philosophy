In one canonical statement of his position,\nReid says,\nThe sceptic asks me, Why do you believe the existence of\nthe external object which you perceive? This belief, sir, is none of\nmy manufacture; it came from the mint of Nature; it bears her image\nand superscription; and, if it is not right, the fault is not mine: I\neven took it upon trust, and without suspicion. Reason, says the\nsceptic, is the only judge of truth, and you ought to throw off every\nopinion and every belief that is not grounded on reason. Why, sir,\nshould I believe the faculty of reason more than that of\nperception?\u2014they came both out of the same shop, and were made\nby the same artist; and if he puts one piece of false ware into my\nhands, what should hinder him from putting another? (IHM 6.20,\n168\u2013169)\n\n\nThe mistake that the skeptic makes, according to Reid, is to deny the\ntruth of something that is demanded by our constitutions. To perceive\nan object as possessing a particular property is to have a conception\nof the object delivered by one's constitution. What makes us convinced\nof the accuracy of the conceptions of objects involved in perception\nis that they arise from our constitutions. But, asks Reid here, why do\nwe find skeptical arguments so compelling? Why would someone sincerely\naccept the radical skeptical conclusions following from Descartes's\nhypothesis of the evil demon?\n\n \nUltimately, we think that such arguments lead to their conclusions\nbecause we accept certain logical principles\u2014such as the law of\nnon-contradiction, or modus ponens\u2014which appear to us to be\nself-evident. But to say that such principles are self-evident is just\nto say that we cannot help but accept them. It is not to offer any\nnon-circular justification of those principles. But the\nirresistibility of a belief is a very good indicator, Reid thinks,\nthat we hold that belief merely because of the way we are built,\nmerely because of our constitution. But then the skeptic has merely\nplaced the skeptical conclusion on the same footing as the common\nsense belief about the external world: both rest on something that we\nare compelled to believe by our constitutions. However, in order to\noverthrow common sense, the skeptic must place the skeptical\nconclusion, rather, on a firmer footing than the common\nsense conclusion. Thus, the skeptic gives us no reason to reject\ncommon sense beliefs about the external world. Reid has defended\ncommon sense through construction of a direct theory of perception\nthat avoids the pitfalls of the Way of Ideas' representational\ntheory. Rather than landing in the \u201ccoal pit\u201d of\nskepticism, as Reid calls it, his theory purports to deliver knowledge\nof the external world.\n",
