    "main_text": "Background and Scop\n1. Background and Scope\n\nThe Opium Wars (1839\u20131842 and 1856\u20131860), in which China\nsuffered defeat at the hands of Britain and France, marked the\nbeginning of greater interest in Western knowledge, initially to catch\nup to their superior military technology. Toward the latter part of\nthe nineteenth century, Chinese reformers began to look deeper into\nthe scientific and technological advantages of the Western countries,\nbecoming convinced that their political and economic systems laid the\ngroundwork for them. Yan Fu was influential in translating scientific,\neconomic, and philosophical works into Chinese. Interest in Western\nknowledge led to sending students overseas to study, and eventually\nthe establishment of universities in China. The major figures of\ncontemporary Confucianism were part of this educational reform, either\nteaching or studying at universities established on the European\nmodel, which no Confucian philosopher had before. Modern Confucianism\nis characterized in part by this transformation into an academic\nfield.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, Chinese scholars began to publish\ntheir own histories of Chinese philosophy and analyses of Chinese\nculture, which may be considered the initial works of contemporary\nConfucianism. Some of the significant milestones were Liang\nShuming\u2019s Eastern and Western Cultures and Their\nPhilosophies (1921) and Feng Youlan\u2019s History of\nChinese Philosophy (1931 and 1934). Xiong Shili\u2019s New\nTreatise on the Uniqueness of Consciousness (1932) is sometimes\nconsidered the first work of modern Confucianism proper.\n\nThe great interest in Western knowledge in China was often accompanied\nby a degree of disdain for tradition, and there was a camp that felt\nthat all of traditional Chinese culture was an impediment to\nmodernization and should be discarded. Modern Confucianism developed\nin response to this, defending the value of Chinese tradition,\nConfucianism especially, and arguing that it can support modernization\nrather than obstruct it (Van den Stock 2016: 143; Yao 2000:\n268\u201373). In particular, it can accommodate science and\ndemocracy, which many in China had latched onto as the roots of\nWestern dominance. Modern Confucianism is thus somewhat conservative,\nas it is inherently a defense of aspects of Chinese tradition, but\nalso recognizes the need for adaptation and evolution.\n\nThis entry focuses on a group of scholars who exemplify these features\nand developed the most influential Confucian philosophies of the\ntwentieth century: Xiong Shili \u718a\u5341\u529b\n(1885\u20131968) and his followers Mou Zongsan\n\u725f\u5b97\u4e09 (1909\u20131995), Tang Junyi\n\u5510\u541b\u6bc5 (1909\u20131978), and Xu Fuguan\n\u5f90\u5fa9\u89c0 (1903\u20131982). The latter three (along\nwith Zhang Junmai) were involved in writing what has become known as\nthe New Confucian Manifesto. Originally drafted by Tang with comments\nfrom the others, this document is retrospectively identified as a\nwatershed in modern Confucian thought (Makeham 2003a: 27\u201329;\nSol\u00e9-Farr\u00e0s 2014). They are often called disciples of\nXiong (Ng Yu-kwan 2003: 219), but that is a little misleading. Mou and\nTang attended classes with Xiong while students, and Mou does call\nXiong his teacher while also not shying from critical judgment of\nXiong\u2019s philosophy (Mou 1991 [2014: 47\u201348]). Tang admitted\nhe didn\u2019t understand Xiong very well and chose not to follow him\nclosely (TJCW 26: 2.363; Fr\u00f6hlich 2017: 36\u201337). At one\npoint, he said his teacher was Fang Dongmei, not Xiong (Chiu 2016: 5,\n15). Xu met Xiong much later in life during WWII when he was an army\nofficer. None followed Xiong very precisely in their scholarship, as\nXiong himself said (TJCW 26: 2.362). They were inspired by his\ncharacter and sense of cultural mission more than they adhered to his\nideas or methods.\n\nWhat they did share with Xiong is a strong preference for the Wang\nYangming wing of Confucian thought, a focus on intuitive and\nexperiential moral knowledge, and the belief that firm moral values\nare critical for the health of a culture (N. S. Chan 2011:\n25\u201364). New Confucianism specifically usually refers to this\ngroup and their followers. They identify as defenders of Chinese\nthought and culture, especially as Confucians. They are concerned with\nthe relevance of Chinese thought when the institutions and cultural\ncircumstances that supported it no longer existed. While differing in\nnumerous respects that will become clear throughout the entry, they\nhad enough in common to constitute an identifiable group. Their\nhistorical work on Chinese philosophy, significant as it is, will not\nbe a major focus. Rather, this entry will emphasize their distinct\nprojects relating to the ideas of Confucian and Chinese modernity, and\nwhat they believed Chinese philosophy could contribute to world\nphilosophy.\n\nXiong Shili was born into a poor family in rural Hubei. His parents\ndied when he was young, leaving little opportunity for formal\nschooling. He joined in various revolutionary activities in his\ntwenties, but in the years after the 1911 Revolution, abandoned\npolitical action and turned to study. In 1920 Xiong went to study\nYogacara Buddhism at the China Institute for Inner Learning. Two years\nlater, he was invited by Cai Yuanpei to teach at Beijing University.\nThere he initially taught Yogacara thought, but gradually became\ndissatisfied with aspects of it. He began to make a critique of\ntraditional Yogacara, moving toward a form blended with more Confucian\nelements that he published in 1932 as New Treatise on the\nUniqueness of Consciousness. This was a seminal event and made\nXiong\u2019s reputation. While he published other works, it remains\nwhat he is best known for. Xiong suffered from poor health for much of\nhis life, often taking extended leaves from teaching. Already in his\nsixties at the time of the Communist revolution in 1949, he chose to\nremain in China. He suffered from attacks during the Cultural\nRevolution and died in Shanghai in 1968 at the age of 84.\n\nMou Zongsan was born in rural Shandong province in 1909. In 1927, he\nmoved to Beijing, enrolling at Beijing University. After finishing his\ndegree in philosophy, he moved around China, struggling to support\nhimself and his family in a series of editing and teaching posts. In\n1949, Mou fled to Taiwan, where he began to reflect on how the history\nof China had led to the failure of democracy and subsequent Communist\ntakeover, and articulating a Confucian theory of democracy. He later\nhad to move to Hong Kong, where he produced one of his major works,\nthe three-volume Heart-mind and Human Nature as Reality\n(1968\u201369). His last philosophical phase was a sustained\nengagement with Kant in which he attempts to show that Kant\u2019s\nphilosophical project was doomed and could only be reconstructed and\nrealized through Chinese philosophy (Mou 1991 [2014: 56]). His goal\nwas to give morality a stable foundation by demonstrating the reality\nof the free autonomous will. In addition to translating Kant\u2019s\nthree Critiques, he wrote Intellectual Intuition and\nChinese Philosophy (1971), Appearances and Things in\nThemselves (1975), and On the Highest Good (1985). These\nmade him widely acclaimed as the greatest Chinese philosopher of the\ntwentieth century. Mou died in Taiwan in 1995.\n\nTang Junyi was born in Sichuan province in 1909. He studied philosophy\ninitially at Beijing University, then National Southeast University\n(subsequently National Central University), graduating in 1932. Like\nMou Zongsan, he moved around frequently during the war with Japan and\nsubsequent Chinese civil war, also choosing to leave in 1949 when he\nwent to Hong Kong, where he remained until the end of his life in\n1978. He became one of the founders of New Asia College, one of the\nfirst Chinese-language institutes of higher education in the British\ncolony. Tang was also extraordinarily prolific, writing extensively on\nthe moral self, Chinese and Western cultures, the history of Chinese\nphilosophy, knowledge, ethics, metaphysics, and political thought. His\nregular themes were articulating the essential connections between\nindividuals and between the mind and world that are the basis for\nexistence, human nature and morality, and knowledge. Among his most\nfrequently cited works are Cultural Consciousness and Moral\nReason (1958), his multi-volume Origins of Chinese\nPhilosophy (1966\u20131973), and his last book, the two-volume\nLife Existence and the Horizons of Mind (1977).\n\nAlso born into a rural family, in Hubei province (the native place of\nXiong Shili) in 1903, Xu Fuguan followed a very different path than\nhis slightly younger contemporaries Mou and Tang. After finishing\nschool in China, he joined the Nationalist army for a stable income.\nHe went to Japan in 1928 to study economics, but had to return to\nChina after a year due to financial difficulties. He went back to\nJapan in 1930 to attend army officers\u2019 school, leaving in 1931\nafter the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. He spent the next fifteen\nyears as an army officer, rising to the rank of general and for a time\nserving as the personal aide to President Jiang Jieshi (Chiang\nKai-shek), retiring in 1946. He too fled China in 1949 and settled in\nTaiwan to pursue a second career as a teacher. Xu eventually took a\nposition in the Chinese department at the newly established Donghai\n(Tunghai) University, and wrote extensively on Chinese intellectual\nhistory, culture, literature, and art. He is perhaps best known for\nA History of Chinese Theories of Human Nature (1963), its\nsequel Intellectual History of the Two Han Dynasties\n(1975\u201376), and The Spirit of Chinese Art (1966), along\nwith several collections of essays on intellectual history, culture,\nand politics. He was forced out of his teaching job in 1969 due to\ncriticisms of the government and had to move to Hong Kong. Although he\ndid not reside in Taiwan again, he died there in 1982.\n",
