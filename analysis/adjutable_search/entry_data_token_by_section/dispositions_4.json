    "main_text": "Analyses of Disposition Ascriptions || Sophisticated Analyses\n1.4 Sophisticated Analyses\n\nThe typical reaction to the counterexamples is to take them to\nmotivate a sophisticated conditional analysis. Versions of\nsophisticated analyses of dispositions have been offered by Prior\n(1985), Lewis (1997), Malzkorn (2000), Mellor (2000), Fara (2005),\nManley & Wasserman (2008), Vetter (2014, 2015), and Kroll (2017).\nHere we will focus on Lewis\u2019s, Manley & Wasserman\u2019s, and Vetter\u2019s\nanalyses.\n\nLewis (1997) points out that if Martin\u2019s examples are to succeed as\ncounterexamples to SCA then we must suppose\nthat \\(x\\)\u2019s dispositions are intimately related to its\nintrinsic properties. For consider again Martin\u2019s example of an\napparently dead wire attached to an electro-fink. Choi and Gundersen\u2019s\ndefence of SCA rests on the insistence that the\nwire is not dead but live. But we can imagine its intrinsic duplicate\nunconnected to an electro-fink, which is unquestionably dead. Choi and\nGundersen\u2019s defence therefore has the consequence that whether the\nwire is live or dead is an extrinsic matter. When\nMartin\u2019s examples are supplemented with the assumption that\ndispositions involved in the examples are intrinsic to their bearers,\ntherefore, this will preclude Choi and Gundersen\u2019s defence\nof SCA. And so, Lewis, subscribing to the Intrinsic\nDispositions Thesis (for short, IDT) that all dispositions are\nintrinsic to their bearers, concludes that Martin\u2019s examples have left\nno hope for SCA. But is IDT true? We will discuss it\nlater in\n section 5.\n\nLewis\u2019s proposal (with some simplifications) is:\n\nRCA. \nAn object \\(x\\) is disposed to \\(M\\) when \\(C\\) iff \\(x\\) has an\nintrinsic property \\(B\\) such that, if it were the case that \\(C\\),\nand if \\(x\\) were to retain \\(B\\) for a sufficient time, then \\(C\\)\nand \\(B\\) would jointly cause \\(x\\) to \\(M\\).\n\nLewis\u2019s amendment enables us to circumvent the problem of finks and\nreverse-cycle finks. Martin\u2019s live wire connected to the reverse-cycle\nfink, for example, is correctly predicted to be live. For the wire has\nan intrinsic property\u2014the property of having free electrons,\nsay\u2014such that, if it were touched by a conductor, and\nif it were to retain that property for a sufficient time,\nthen the wire would conduct electricity (because of being touched and\nhaving the property).\n\nIt seems, though, that Lewis\u2019s amendment doesn\u2019t help with the\nproblems of maskers and mimickers (Bird 1998; Fara 2005; Choi 2005a).\nRecall the fragile glass carefully protected with the packing\nmaterial. The glass, it is thought, is disposed to break when struck.\nWhat if it were struck? It would retain all of its molecular\nstructures for a sufficient time. But it would not break because of\nthe masking operation of the packing material.\nSo RCA seems to fail.\nSimilarly, RCA doesn\u2019t avoid the problem of\nmimickers. The styrofoam dish, if struck, would break by the mimicking\noperation of the Hater of Styrofoam. Note that, if struck, the dish\nwould retain for a sufficient time an intrinsic property, say, the\nmicrostructure responsible for its distinctive sound and, further,\nthis intrinsic property would be a cause of the breaking. The\nprediction by RCA is therefore that the styrofoam\ndish is disposed to break when struck, which might be claimed to be\ncounterintuitive.\n\nIn an effort to deflect the problem of maskers, Lewis employs what\nManley & Wasserman (2008) name the strategy of getting\nspecific. He suggests that we have a choice. We might, on the one\nhand, say that the protected glass is disposed to break when struck\nwithout the packing material; or we might say, instead, that it is\ndisposed to break when struck but this disposition is masked by the\npacking material. Lewis insinuates that the first option is preferable\nto the second one. The first option being taken, however, one may well\ninsist that the glass is not disposed to break when struck, which\nneutralises the problem of maskers. (Note that the strategy of getting\nspecific is basically the same as the one Choi and Gundersen take to\ndeal with the problems of finks, reverse-finks, and mimickers as well\nas the problem of maskers.)\n\nLewis\u2019s response to the problem of mimickers, on the other hand, is to\ninvoke the idea that the manifestation of fragility is not\nsimply \\(x\\)\u2019s breaking but \\(x\\)\u2019s\nbreaking through a certain direct and standard process.\nThe styrofoam dish, if struck, would break but not through a certain\ndirect and standard process for fragility, a process that does not\ninvolve the Hater of Styrofoam\u2019s intervention. Then the dish is not\nfragile as it is not disposed to break through a certain direct and\nstandard process if struck. Having explained away the intuition that\nthe dish is not fragile, it opens the possibility of insisting that,\ngiven that the dish is situated within the earshot of the Hater of\nStyrofoam, it is indeed disposed to break when struck, which\nneutralises the problem of mimickers. (See Choi 2005a for a criticism\nof Lewis\u2019s response.)\n\nWe have three comments to add on Lewis\u2019s responses. The first comment\nis that Lewis denies that the problems of maskers and mimickers throw\nlight on the analysis of dispositionality that\nphilosophers intend to attain by the conditional analysis of\ndispositions. On his view, they touch upon merely the pragmatic issue\nof what specifications are built into the stimulus conditions and\nmanifestations corresponding to a given dispositional concept. This is\ndisputed by Choi (2008). Secondly, there is a\nnoticeable tension between Lewis\u2019s criticism\nof SCA and his defence of RCA from\nthe problems of maskers and mimickers. We have seen earlier that Lewis\ntries to add force to the problem of finks by assuming IDT. But this\nassumption seems to undermine his own defence\nof RCA from the problems of maskers and mimickers.\nLewis\u2019s response to the problem of maskers is that the protected glass\nis disposed to break when struck without the packing material, which\nexplains away the intuition that it is fragile; and that this opens\nthe door for insisting that it is in fact not disposed to break when\nstruck. But this move seems to be on a collision course with IDT\nbecause an unprotected intrinsic duplicate of the glass is undoubtedly\ndisposed to break when struck. This illustrates the tension between\nLewis\u2019s treatments of the problems of finks and\nmaskers\u2014and mutatis mutandis for the problems\nof mimickers (see Choi 2009 for discussion).\n\nTo introduce the third comment on Lewis\u2019s approach, let us compare it\nwith Choi and Gundersen\u2019s approach that rules out finks, reverse-cycle\nfinks, maskers, mimickers, etc., from the stimulus condition. A\nconspicuous difference between them is that, whilst, on Choi and\nGundersen\u2019s approach, all of the problems of finks, reverse-cycle\nfinks, maskers, and mimickers are handled in a\nuniform manner, this is not the case for Lewis\u2019s\napproach. Lewis deals with them by\ninvoking diverse elements in RCA: the\ncondition that \\(x\\) retain an intrinsic property for a\nsufficient time, the condition that the intrinsic property causally\ncontribute to the occurrence of the manifestation, the condition that\nmaskers be absent from the stimulus condition, the condition that the\nmanifestation of fragility be \\(x\\)\u2019s breaking through a\ncertain direct and standard process. Other things being equal, this\ndifference will favour Choi and Gundersen\u2019s approach over Lewis\u2019s as\nexplanatory unity is a theoretical virtue. (See Gundersen 2017 and\nSchlosser 2018 for an ongoing dispute about RCA\u2019s\nviability.)\n\nHaving discussed Lewis\u2019s analysis of dispositions in detail, let us\nturn to a more recent proposal by Manley & Wasserman (2007, 2008).\nThey take cues from, among other things, comparative\ndisposition ascriptions like \u2018\\(x\\) is more\ndisposed to break when struck than \\(y\\)\u2019. They stress\nthat the versions of the conditional analysis of dispositions\ndiscussed so far cannot accommodate these comparative ascriptions as\ncounterfactual conditionals invoked by conditional analyses do not\nadmit of degree. This consideration suggests the following account of\ndispositions, or so they argue.\n\nPROP. \n\\(x\\) is disposed to \\(M\\) in \\(C\\) iff some suitable proportion of\n\\(C\\)-cases are such that \\(x\\) would \\(M\\) in them,\n\n\nwhere a \\(C\\)-case is a fully specific scenario that\nsettles everything causally relevant to the manifestation of the\ndisposition. The suitable proportion of \\(C\\)-cases is\nfixed partly by the stimulus condition \\(C\\) and partly\nby the context of ascription.\n\nOn PROP, \u2018\\(x\\) is more disposed\nto \\(M\\) in \\(C\\) than \\(y\\)\u2019\nmeans that \\(x\\) would \\(M\\) in a\ngreater proportion of \\(C\\)-cases\nthan \\(y\\). PROP thus seems to provide an\naccount of comparative disposition ascriptions. Further, Manley &\nWasserman hold that PROP has no difficulty handling\nsome apparent counterexamples to the conditional analyses of\ndispositions on offer. A fragile glass wouldn\u2019t break in the presence\nof finks or maskers. PROP, however, rules correctly that it\nis disposed to break when struck. That is because the glass would\nstill break in a suitable proportion of \\(C\\)-cases where it is\nstruck. On the other hand, a non-fragile steel bar would break in the\npresence of reverse-finks or mimicker. Yet again, PROP\nentails correctly that it is not disposed to break when struck. That\nis because the steel bar wouldn\u2019t break in a suitable proportion of\n\\(C\\)-cases where it is struck.\n\nBut Manley & Wasserman\u2019s analysis is not without difficulties. The\ntrouble is that it is extremely difficult to make\nsense of talk of proportions of \\(C\\)-cases,\nespecially given that very diverse factors are supposed to affect the\nweights of given \\(C\\)-cases: closeness of them to\nactuality, contextual variations of their weights, and so on. In\naddition, Manley & Wasserman\u2019s account of comparative disposition\nascriptions requires a non-arbitrary standard for comparing the sizes\nof infinite sets of \\(C\\)-cases despite most of them\nbeing of the same cardinality. But it looks to be a\ntremendous task to set up such a standard, let alone, to do so in a\nway that is epistemically accessible to those of us who possess the\ndispositional concepts at issue.\n\nVetter (2014, 2015) challenges what she calls \u2018the standard\nconception of dispositionality\u2019, according to which a\ndisposition \\(D\\) is individuated by the pair of its stimulus\ncondition \\(S\\) and its manifestation \\(M\\), and its modal\nnature is at least approximately captured by a counterfactual\nconditional \u2018If \\(x\\) were in \\(S, x\\) would\n\\(M\\rsquo\\). The alternative she proposes is the possibility\nconception of dispositionality according to which a disposition is\nindividuated by its manifestation \\(M\\) alone and its modal\nnature is that of possibility, best characterised by \u2018\\(x\\)\ncan \\(M\\rsquo.\\) On this conception, the stimulus condition\nplays no role in individuating dispositions. Hence dispositional\nsentences are akin to \u2018can\u2019 sentences. With this in the\nbackground, Vetter first proposes an analysis of comparative\ndispositional ascriptions which says that \\(x\\) is more disposed\nto \\(M\\) than \\(y\\) iff \\(x\\) would \\(M\\) in more\ncases than \\(y\\), where cases are triples of a world, a time, and\nan object. For instance, to say that \\(x\\) is more disposed to\nbreak than \\(y\\) is to say that \\(x\\) would break in more\ncases than \\(y\\). Vetter then proposes that \\(x\\) is\ndisposed to break simpliciter just in case it breaks in a\nsufficiently large proportion of the relevant cases, where context may\ndetermine what counts as sufficiently large.\n\nVetter\u2019s proposal has much in common with Manley & Wasserman\u2019s,\nwhich means that the former inherits many of the latter\u2019s advantages\nand disadvantages. The key difference between them is that Manley\n& Wasserman, along with other defenders of conditional analyses of\ndispositions, hold on to the standard conception that the essential\ncharacterization of a disposition requires a reference to its stimulus\ncondition as well as its manifestation but Vetter opposes this\nconception. It remains to be seen how this difference will be\nsettled.\n",
