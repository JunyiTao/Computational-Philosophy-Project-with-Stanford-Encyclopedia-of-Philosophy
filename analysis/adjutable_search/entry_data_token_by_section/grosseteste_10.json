    "main_text": "Exemplarism, Truth and Illumination || Truth\n10.2 Truth\n Grosseteste wrote in a tradition that employed the concept of\ntruth in a number of different contexts. We may speak not only of the\ntruth of propositions or thoughts, but also of things\u2014e.g. of\na tree or a human being\u2014and God himself or the eternal Word is\nidentified with truth. In his treatise On Truth Grosseteste\ntakes up the question, raised by Anselm, whether there is just one\ntruth (veritas), God, or many truths (veritates).\nBut much of his account is concerned to present a uniform conception\nof truth that embraces these different applications of the term noted\nabove. The doctrine of eternal exemplar forms plays an important role\nin this account.\n According to Grosseteste\u2019s treatise On Truth, truth is\nthe conformity or adequation of things and speech, or more\nparticularly, the thought expressed by speech.  This conception of\ntruth as adequation had only recently entered the Latin West, but\nGrosseteste gives it a twist all his own, taking the speech in\nquestion to be that of God, the eternal Word. Thus truth\n(veritas) is a conformity between things and the eternal\nWord. Grosseteste claims that the eternal Word is itself its very own\nconformity to itself and thus may be identified with truth. As for\ncreated things, their truth is their conformity to their eternal model\nor reason in the eternal Word. Likewise, the truth of \npropositions\u2014a subclass of things\u2014is their conformity to their\neternal model or reason in the eternal Word. This, on first\nappearance, would appear to clash with the idea that a proposition\u2019s\ntruth is not its conformity to anything in God, but rather to the\nstate of affairs in the world whose obtaining it asserts; but this\nappearance is deceptive.  A thing\u2019s conformity to its eternal reason,\nits truth, is its having the being its exemplar specifies. Now,\nGrosseteste holds that created items have two kinds of being or\nperfection. In his commentary on the Posterior Analytics he\nholds that the second perfection of a thing is \u201cthe completion of the\nactivity of the thing to which it has, as such, been established to be\nfitted and for the sake of which it has been established\u201d (Rossi 1981,\n240).  The first being of a thing is its simply being the kind of\nthing it is.  Thus, there is a twofold conformity possible of things\nto their eternal reasons. On the one hand, the eternal reason of a\nthing specifies the very kind of thing that thing is, and simply in\nvirtue of existing as an item of a determinate kind a thing will\nnecessarily conform to its exemplar in this respect and be true. Thus\nall human beings and all propositions are true, in this sense, in that\nthey are the kinds of things they are, this being specified by their\nexemplar. A human being is a composite of body and soul, and a\nproposition is \u201cthe statement of one thing about another or one thing\nfrom another\u201d (Baur 1912, 143). On the other hand, the eternal reason\nspecifies the second perfection a thing ought to have but may\nnonetheless lack. In this sense a human being will be a false human\nbeing if, for example, she is vicious, falling short of the perfection\nof virtue specified in the eternal reason of a human being. Likewise,\na proposition will be a false proposition if it fails to perform the\nfunction of a proposition, this being to state things as they in fact\nare in the world.  Thus, the ordinary notion of propositional truth,\ndescribed by Aristotle as \u201cto so be in the thing signified as speech\nsays,\u201d is a matter of a proposition\u2019s conformity, in respect of second\nbeing, to its eternal reason, and this is for it to perform the\nfunction perfective of propositions, namely, to be in conformity to\nthe states of affairs it asserts.\n With this account of truth Grosseteste thinks he can accommodate\nwithin one schema the divergent conceptions of truth present in his\nday. As to the initial question he drew from Anselm, whether there is\njust one truth or many, diverging from Anselm, who posits a single truth, he holds that there are many truths\n(veritates), for otherwise the term \u201ctruth\u201d could\nnot admit a plural or be distributed (by which he means we\ncould not speak of \u201cevery truth\u201d) (for the relation between Anselm\u2019s and Grosseteste\u2019s accounts of truth, see Noone 2010).  Nevertheless, he concludes that\n\u201cthere is a single truth that the name \u2018truth\u2019 everywhere\nsignifies and predicates\u2014namely, the supreme\ntruth\u2014though this one truth is called many truths in the many\ntruths of things\u201d (Baur 1912, 139).  Thus, for Grosseteste any use of\nthe term \u201ctruth\u201d involves in some way a reference to the supreme\ntruth, God.\n",
