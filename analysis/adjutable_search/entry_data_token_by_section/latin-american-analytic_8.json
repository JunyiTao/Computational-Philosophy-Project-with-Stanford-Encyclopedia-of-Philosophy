    "main_text": "Original Contributions by Latin American Analytic Philosophers || Philosophy of Language and Mind\n3.1 Philosophy of Language and Mind\n\nMany Latin American analytic philosophers have joined the\nreferentialist movement that started with Barcan Marcus, Donnellan,\nPutnam, Kripke, Kaplan, and others.\n\nA key question for that movement concerns reference fixing: How do\n(uses of) linguistic expressions come to have the conventional\nreferents they have? G\u00f3mez-Torrente has offered accounts of\nreference fixing for widely discussed terms like definite descriptions\n(G\u00f3mez-Torrente 2015), proper names, demonstratives, and nouns\nfor natural kinds (G\u00f3mez-Torrente 2019) and less discussed\nterms like Arabic numerals, color adjectives (G\u00f3mez-Torrente\n2019), and quotations (G\u00f3mez-Torrente 2013, 2017). His starting\npoint is a conception of human endeavors according to which\n\u201ctruth is something we pursue and very often achieve\u201d\n(G\u00f3mez-Torrente 2019, 9). Since truth depends on successful\nreference, a theory of reference should ensure that, in some central\nareas of discourse, our (uses of) linguistic expressions successfully\nrefer. To this end, one should think of the theory of reference as\nintertwined with metaphysics and epistemology. Metaphysically, one\nshould not think of the referents of referential expressions as\npeculiar and inaccessible entities. Epistemically, one should only\nposit reference-fixing conventions that humans can plausibly follow.\nAlthough shared reference-fixing conventions play a role in the\nexplanation of communication, one should not construe (many of) them\nas descriptive senses. Rather than trying to offer necessary and\nsufficient conditions that fix the reference of any possible use of an\nexpression, one should settle for conventions that provide roughly\nsufficient conditions for reference that work for some central uses\nand leave less central uses\n indeterminate.[93]\n\nMarco Ruffino has made another contribution to the referentialist\nmovement. Kripke (1980) famously argued that his views on proper names\nmade room for contingent truths that are a priori knowable. Let\n\u201cS\u201d be a particular stick used to conventionally\nestablish what we call \u201cmeter\u201d and\n\u201ct0\u201d the time at which the convention\nwas established. Consider now an utterance of (M):\n\n(M)\nThe length of S at t0 is one meter\nlong.\n\n\nFor Kripke, (M) expresses a contingent truth because S could\nbe longer or shorter than it actually is. And it is a priori knowable\nbecause the baptizer only needs to know the convention expressed by\n\u201cthe length of S at\nt0\u201d\u2014with no reliance on experience. A\nproblem for Kripke\u2019s view arises when one asks a metaphysical\nquestion: If (M) refers to an independently existing truth-maker, how\ncould one possibly know it a priori? Ruffino (2022) has tried to meet\nthis challenge by taking seriously the idea that many contingent a\npriori truths arise from stipulations. Building on speech-act theory,\nRuffino submits that cases like (M) originate from a specific type of\nspeech act that creates its own truth-maker. Consider a priest\u2019s\nutterance of \u201cI declare you husband and wife\u201d. If\nsuccessful, this declarative illocutionary act (Searle and Vanderveken\n1985) \u201cautomatically creates an alignment between word and world\n[\u2026] because the act itself brings about a new fact that\nverifies it\u201d (Ruffino 2022, 161). Since this new fact does not\nexist independently of the stipulation, there is no mystery as to how\nit could be known a\n priori.[94]\n\nReferential views like G\u00f3mez-Torrente\u2019s and\nRuffino\u2019s face a problem: many of the expressions whose\nreference they have tried to elucidate have non-referential uses. This\nproblem has led many authors to reject the traditional view of proper\nnames, indexicals, and demonstratives as referential expressions. For\nexample, some authors have argued that complex demonstratives are\nquantificational phrases (King 2000; Neale 2008; Lepore and Ludwig\n2000), and others have claimed that proper names are common nouns or\npredicates (Burge 1973; Fara 2015). Ezcurdia (2017, 2022) develops a\nreferential view that tackles the problem of non-referential uses.\nAccording to her referential functionalism, what makes an\nexpression referential is its function. More specifically,\ne is a referential expression just in case e has the\nfunction of communicating singular thoughts. On Ezcurdia\u2019s view,\nthis function explains why humans still employ proper names,\nindexicals, and demonstratives. Given that a function can go\nunfulfilled, referential expressions can have non-referential uses as\nwell. Ezcurdia\u2019s referential functionalism has two consequences:\nreferential expressions are systematically ambiguous, and a\nsemantically complex expression like \u201cthat taco\u201d can be\ngenuinely\n referential.[95]\n\nSlurs have also featured in recent Latin American philosophy of\nlanguage. A slur like \u201cspic\u201d is a word that conveys\nderogatory feelings for members of a certain group of people. Orlando\nand Saab (2019, 2020a, 2020b) defend a version of a dual analysis of\nparadigmatic slurs. Following Kaplan (1999), they associate slurs with\na dualistic semantics: a truth-conditional meaning and an expressive\n meaning.[96]\n What distinguishes their view from others is their account of\nexpressive meaning. They think of expressive meaning as determined by\na culturally determined stereotype, i.e., a set of schematic,\nsimple-minded, oversimplified, and mostly false beliefs involving a\nprejudicial view of the corresponding group. Thus, the stereotype for\n\u201cspic\u201d is a complex concept that encodes a global negative\nvalence: illegal, with a spanish accent, poor,\nuntrustworthy, family-oriented, good dancer, prone to laziness,\n etc.[97]\n Orlando and Saab model those stereotypes on Wittgenstein\u2019s\n(1953) notion of family resemblance. Thus, stereotypes do not offer\nnecessary and sufficient conditions that determine the corresponding\n extensions.[98]\n[99]\n\nSeveral Latin American philosophers have investigated the role of\nlanguage in the human mind. Their work has been influenced by\nWittgenstein and, in some cases, by empirical findings from cognitive\nscience.\n\nAt least since Black (1955), analytic philosophers have tried to\nexplain how metaphors work. Fermandois (2000, 2008, 2009, 2010) argues\nthat many analytic accounts of metaphor have trouble explaining our\nunderstanding and cognitive uses of \u201cstrong metaphors\u201d.\nVery roughly, strong metaphors are highly surprising and rich, so they\ncannot be easily paraphrased in a finite number of\n sentences.[100]\n An example of a strong metaphor is Wittgenstein\u2019s view of\nlanguage as a toolbox. While semantic accounts explain metaphor by\npositing a change in the meaning of sentences, pragmatic accounts rely\non Gricean intentions (Grice 1989) and speech acts (Searle 1969) to\nderive a few, true propositional contents from the literal content\nassociated with an utterance of a sentence. Insofar as these\napproaches depict metaphoric interpretation as an almost automatic\nderivation of a few propositional contents, they have a hard time\naccommodating the open-ended character of strong metaphors and the\nactive role of the interpreter in building an adequate interpretation\nof those metaphors. They also overlook two important features of\nstrong metaphors, namely, that they invite the formation of further\nmetaphoric thoughts and routinely exploit non-propositional elements\nlike experiences of \u201cseeing-as\u201d and emotions. In a more\npositive vein, Fermandois offers a characterization of strong\nmetaphors as tools that show new ways of seeing things, suggesting\nthat this role is best served if one reintroduces non-propositional\nelements, and supplements those non-propositional elements with a\nsui generis form of non-propositional, context-bound\ncorrectness.\n\nIn many everyday conversations, a hearer can automatically, fluently,\nand directly determine the intuitive truth-conditions of an utterance\nmade in their mother tongue. Leclerc (2009, 2012) has made some\ncontributions to the elucidation of this phenomenon, which he dubs\n\u201cspontaneous linguistic understanding\u201d (SLU). To begin\nwith, he offers a contrastive characterization of SLU. He contends\nthat SLU is a kind of occurrent understanding that differs from other\nphenomena, such as the understanding one can get from a foreign\nlanguage one does not fully understand or the \u201cdetached\u201d\nknowledge one can acquire of the content of an utterance from a\ntranslator. Furthermore, Leclerc argues that two influential programs,\nDavidson\u2019s (1984) and Grice\u2019s (1989), are inadequate to\ncharacterize the competences underlying SLU. Finally, building on\nideas from other philosophers, he offers the bare bones of an account\nof the competences underlying SLU. Very roughly, SLU is a kind of\noccurrent understanding that involves experience, it is not\nunderwritten by propositional knowledge but by a battery of\ndispositions, and it is ultimately grounded in human understanding of\nactions and\n situations.[101]\n\nWhat are the most distinctive features of human languages? Scotto\n(2017, 2019a, 2019b, 2020) thinks that human languages are\nmultimodal and semiotically heterogeneous systems. A\nlong-standing view thinks of speech as linked to a single modality:\nsound production in speakers and audition in hearers. Building on\nfindings from cognitive science and an original reading of\nWittgenstein\u2019s remarks on meaning experiences, Scotto argues\nthat the unimodal view overlooks the key role of vision and hands in\nthe use of facial expressions and gestures in everyday communication,\nbodily posture, and speakers\u2019 proprioception of the muscles,\ntongue, and lips they use in the production of speech. Her focus on\nthe multimodal character of human languages casts doubts on some\nentrenched views of language. Consider one such view. If one thinks of\nlanguage production and interpretation as unimodal, it is tempting to\nendorse the view that words are linked to their contents by convention\n(as did Hockett 1960, Locke 1690, and de Saussure 1983). But, if\nlanguages exploit many other modalities with higher iconic potential,\nit is more plausible to think of large portions of languages as\nconnecting with their referents and the emotions they express through\nvarious forms of similarity between signs, referents, and the users of\nthose\n signs.[102]\n[103]\n\nSince Premack and Woodroff (1978), many philosophers, ethologists,\ncognitive scientists, and neuroscientists have investigated the human\nabilities involved in the way we understand each other in everyday\nlife. During the boom of cognitivism, the Theory-Theory and the\nSimulation Theory monopolized the discussion (Davies and Stone 1995;\nCarruthers and Smith 1996). From a post-cognitivist perspective,\nP\u00e9rez (2005a, 2005b, 2013) defends a Wittgensteinian approach\nto psychological concepts and supplements it with a pre-linguistic\nunderstanding of the mental in second-person interactions. Her\nanalysis of those interactions gives a pride of place to psychological\nstates other than belief and insists on the diversity of mental\nstates. This account has some important consequences. Consider\nJackson\u2019s (1982) case of Mary, the brilliant scientist who\napparently learns something new when she leaves her black-and-white\nroom and sees a red apple (see the entry\n Qualia: The Knowledge Argument).\n A popular response says that Mary acquires a phenomenal concept she\npreviously lacked (Alter and Walter 2006). P\u00e9rez (2011) offers\nan account of the possession conditions of phenomenal concepts that\nexplains why Mary lacked the relevant phenomenal concept before she\nleft the room. In joint work with Gomila (P\u00e9rez and Gomila\n2022), P\u00e9rez offers a post-cognitivist, empirically informed\naccount of the second-person perspective as fundamental to the\ndevelopment of mental concepts where emotions and direct perception\nplay a key\n role.[104]\n[105]\n\nMany analytic philosophers active in Latin America have joined the\ndebate on the nature of phenomenal consciousness.\n\nWhen you see a red patch, there is something it is like for you to\nundergo that experience (Nagel 1974). Many theories of phenomenal\nconsciousness have focused on the problem of qualities, which consists\nin characterizing the qualitative character that distinguishes an\nexperience as of a red patch from\u2014let us say\u2014an experience\nas of listening to a birdsong. Sebasti\u00e1n (2012, 2020,\nforthcoming) has focused on an equally important but less discussed\nissue, namely, the fact that experiences have subjective character. He\nhas put forward two hypotheses. First, if one unpacks the subjectivity\nof experience in representational terms, one will be able to use\nconceptual tools from teleosemantic theories of content to offer a\nnaturalistic explanation of subjective character (see the entry\n Teleological Theories of Mental Content).\n Second, if one analyzes the representational content of subjective\ncharacter as a perspectival de se representation analogous to\nthat put forward by Lewis (1979), one will be able to offer an\naccurate characterization of altered states of consciousness and draw\na boundary between conscious and unconscious processes.\n\nAnother topic of interest has been metacognition. Consider the\nfollowing example. Just after the host of a TV show asks,\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the capital of Bolivia?\u201d, Anna rushes to\npress the button before she has even retrieved the answer. Her action\nwas motivated by a \u201cfeeling of knowing\u201d. This and other\n\u201cmetacognitive feelings\u201d have been studied in cognitive\nscience for decades. However, philosophers only started to\nsystematically examine them in the 2000s (Dokic 2012; Proust 2012).\nArango-Mu\u00f1oz (2014a) has contributed to this research program\nby offering a unified account of metacognitive feelings that\nsynthetizes earlier work. On his view, metacognitive feelings are\nintentional experiences whose object is not transparent to the\nsubject, they come in non-conceptual and conceptual forms, and they\nare underwritten by heuristic mechanisms. His work has opened up new\nresearch avenues. For example, given the opacity of their intentional\nobject, metacognitive feelings challenge intentionalist views\naccording to which the phenomenal character of experiences supervenes\non their representational contents (Dretske 2006; Tye 2000).\nMetacognitive feelings can also explain how one manages to efficiently\nemploy external cognitive devices. To illustrate, when one is asked\nwhat the capital of Bolivia is, one must decide whether one retrieves\nthe information from memory or does a Google search.\nArango-Mu\u00f1oz (2013) thinks that this decision is modulated by\nthe presence or absence of the feeling of\n knowing.[106]\n[107]\n\nIn philosophy of action, rationalists hold that agency consists in\nacting for reasons, where reasons are understood thinly as an\nagent\u2019s preferences at the time of acting (Audi 1979; Davidson\n1980; Lewis 1989). Amaya (2013) argues that slips are counterexamples\nto this view. To illustrate, imagine that Axel has the intention to\ndrop his child at the daycare on the way to work. However, without\nchanging his mind, Axel winds up doing something else: he goes\nstraight to his office and leaves the child unattended for the entire\nworkday. A few hours later, his child has died of hyperthermia. On the\nassumption that Axel is a good parent who cares for his child, his\naction does not reveal his preferences at the time. Amaya thinks that\ncases like this one are performance mistakes, i.e., mistakes that\narise in the implementation of an agent\u2019s intention. His\nanalysis gives rise to important questions of cognitive architecture:\nWhat are the roles of capacities such as working memory, attention,\nand vigilance in performance mistakes? Also, questions of\nresponsibility: Given that we hold Axel responsible for his\nnegligence, slips put pressure on the so-called \u201cepistemic\ncondition for moral responsibility\u201d, i.e., the idea that moral\nresponsibility requires awareness of what one is doing, its\nconsequences, or its moral significance (Amaya and Doris 2015; Amaya\n2022). After all, these forms of awareness are absent in Axel\u2019s\nslip and other cases of negligence (but see Rudy-Hiller 2019 for\n criticism).[108]\n",
