    "main_text": "Methodology and Philosophical Framework || Rational Reconstruction\n5.1 Rational Reconstruction\n\nRational reconstruction is the method, and the label, for a cluster of\nmethodological assumptions shaping the major philosophical projects of\nHabermas\u2019s middle period: the theory of communicative action,\ndiscourse ethics, and the discourse theory of law and democracy. He\noriginally developed it as part of an attempt to explain social\nphenomena and to recalibrate critical social theory on the basis of\nformal pragmatics.\n\nRational reconstruction is an approach that Habermas developed on the\nmodel of Noam Chomsky\u2019s universal grammar (1976b [1998b 1: 35]),\nJean Piaget\u2019s developmental psychology, and Lawrence\nKohlberg\u2019s moral psychology (1983 [1990: 33\u201341]). These\nare theories that reconstruct universal human capacities\u2014for\nlanguage acquisition, cognitive development, and moral reasoning,\nrespectively. Habermas\u2019s use of rational reconstruction aims to\nset out the structures, rules, and competences underlying lifeworld\npractices. The targets of the method may also be described as the\nidealizing, counterfactual commitments which participants in a\npractice must make, in order for the practice to be meaningful or\nrational for them (1999a [2003a: 85\u20136]; 2005b chapter 3 [2008a:\n81\u20134]). To rationally reconstruct a practice is to turn the\nimplicit \u201cknow how\u201d of participants into explicit\n\u201cknow that\u201d (1976b [1998b: 33, 34\u20135]). For example,\nrationally reconstructing the everyday practice of communication gives\naccess not to the semantic content of the speaker\u2019s\nparticular utterances, which is already explicitly known, but the\nimplicitly known rules which the speaker follows in\nsuccessfully communicating (1976b [1998b: 33]). Habermas calls this\n\u201cillocutionary\u201d or \u201cpragmatic\u201d meaning.\n\nThese underlying structures are\n\n\nbrought to consciousness through the choice of suitable examples and\ncounterexamples, through contrast and similarity relations, through\ntranslation, paraphrase and so on\u2014that is, through a well\nthought out, maieutic method of interrogation. (1976b [1998b: 40])\n\n\nThey are revealed not as timeless constants, but as they have\ndeveloped over time, with their internal developmental logics\n(Pedersen 2008: 463, 474\u20139). Habermas originally claimed that\nrational reconstruction uncovers knowledge of universal human\ncapabilities, \u201cspecies competences\u201d, rather than the\ncompetences of particular groups or individuals (1976b [1998b:\n34\u20135]; McCarthy 1991: 130\u20132). For example, rationally\nreconstructing the practice of everyday speech uncovers the rules of\ncommunicative action as such, not the grammar of a particular\nlanguage. However, Habermas\u2019s later description of the discourse\ntheory of law and democracy as a rational reconstruction of \u201cthe\nself-understanding of modern legal orders\u201d of democratic\nconstitutional states (1992b [1996b: 82], emphasis removed), evidently\na local phenomenon, suggests that he has since modified the scope of\nthe reconstructive method. Commentators are dividend on this point,\nwith some distinguishing between an \u201cempirical\u201d variety of\nreconstruction on display in the Theory of Communicative\nAction, and a \u201cnormative\u201d variety in Between\nFacts and Norms (Peters 1994: 119), and others arguing that the\nsame methodology underlies both projects (Patberg 2014: 511\u20133;\nhowever, see Gaus 2013: 561). This tension is partly resolved if we\nremember that democratic law-making draws on general communicative\ncompetencies, and makes use of pragmatic, ethical, and moral\ndiscourses. The phenomenon is local, but the capacities involved are\ngeneral.\n\nIn terms of his own work, formal pragmatics rationally reconstructs\nthe communicative capacities possessed by all human beings, making\nthem explicit in Habermas\u2019s accounts of communicative action and\nthe rules for redeeming validity claims (1976b [1998b: 22\u20134]).\nThe discourse theory of morality does this for our capacity for\nengaging in moral discourse, formalizing this in the (D) and (U)\nprinciples (1983 [1990a: chapter 2: 37, chapter 4: 174\u20135]),\nwhile the discourse theory of law and democracy does the same for the\npractice of lawmaking in democratic constitutional states, formalizing\nthis in the system of rights and the principle of democracy (1992b\n[1996b: 110\u20131, 118\u201324, 287]). Importantly, Habermas claims\nthat the theories produced by these processes of rational\nreconstruction have the status of falsifiable\nhypotheses\u2014they are not a priori since they are\nnot necessary claims, although they are supposed to be\n\u201cuniversal\u201d in the sense that they are, at present,\nwithout alternatives. Habermas sometimes refers to them having a\n\u201cweakly transcendental\u201d status.\n\nWhether or not formal pragmatics accurately describes the practice of\nhuman communication can only be decided a posteriori, by the\nfuture \u201csuccess\u201d or \u201cfailure\u201d of the theory as\nan input in further empirical investigations (1976b [1998b: 39]; 1983\n[1990: 32]), with Habermas suggesting coherence between theories as\nthe criterion of success (1981 [1987: 399\u2013400]; 1983 [1990a:\nchapter 2, 39]). J\u00f8rgen Pedersen has argued that it is still\nnot clear what constitutes success and failure in this context, and\nthus not fully clear how rationally reconstructed theories can be\ntested (Pedersen 2008: 478\u20131). Karl-Otto Apel, similarly,\nquestions what it would mean to falsify the \u201cunavoidable\npresuppositions of argumentation\u201d itself (Apel 2002: 19).\n\nHabermas claims that knowledge of the underlying structures and\ncompetences acquired through rational reconstruction can then be used\nfor the purposes of social critique. Supposedly, a version of a\npractice can be identified as pathological, or not fully rationalized,\nif it does not meet the counterfactual idealization which the practice\npresupposes (1983 [1990: 31\u20132]). Habermas thus identifies\nsystematically distorted communication, invalid moral norms, and\nillegitimate laws as deficits in communicative action, moral\ndiscourse, and democratic lawmaking, respectively. Rational\nreconstruction allows us to critique these actual practices according\nto their own internal standards, rather than the critic\u2019s\narbitrarily chosen standards or the philosopher\u2019s supposedly\ntranscendental standards (1992b [1996b: 5]). Similarly, the\ndevelopmental logic revealed by rational reconstruction can be used to\nevaluate processes of historical development as progressive examples\nof collective learning, or as regressive and pathological. As a method\nfor explaining social phenomena, rational reconstruction is neither\nmerely empirical nor hermeneutic; the principles it produces are\nsupposed to ground a kind of social and political theory which is\nneither \u201cideal\u201d nor \u201creal\u201d, but somewhere in\nbetween. Habermas\u2019s claim that philosophy can find within\ntraditions construed as learning processes a \u201cstandpoint of\ncritical evaluation\u201d (1996a essay 3 [1998a: 97]; 1992b [1996b:\n5]) is certainly in the spirit of critical theory, but arguably in\ntension with his other claims that that philosophy should \u201climit\nitself to the clarification of the moral point of view and the\nprocedure of democratic legitimation\u201d (Habermas 1995: 131;\nFinlayson 2019: 205).\n",
