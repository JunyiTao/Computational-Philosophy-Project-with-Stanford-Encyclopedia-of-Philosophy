    "main_text": "Critical work on language and philosophy of language || False gender-neutrality\n1.1 False gender-neutrality\n\nThere has been a great deal of feminist concern over the supposedly\ngender-neutral use of terms like \u2018he\u2019 and\n\u2018man\u2019. It is commonly said that these terms have both\ngender-specific meanings, as in sentences (1) and (2), and\ngender-neutral ones, as in sentences (3) and (4).\n\nHe drank the wine.\nA man went into a bar.\nWhen a student comes into the room, he should pick up a\nhandout.\nMan is a primate.\n\n\nFeminists, however, have pointed out that even the supposed\ngender-neutral meanings of these terms are not really gender-neutral.\nJanice Moulton (1981a) and Adele Mercier (1995) provide examples in\nwhich there is no doubt that a gender-neutral meaning is intended, but\nthis meaning seems unavailable. As a result, the sentences seem\nill-formed:\n\nMan has two sexes; some men are female.\nMan breastfeeds his young.\n\n\nWe are, then, making a classificatory error if we claim that\n\u2018man\u2019 and \u2018he\u2019 are gender-neutral terms. In\norder to avoid such a classificatory error, we need to do more careful\nwork on what the meanings of these terms actually are. Perhaps the\nmeaning of \u2018he\u2019 that has been called\n\u2018gender-neutral\u2019 is not really gender-neutral, but\nsomething much more complex. Mercier suggests, for example, that we\nshould understand the \u2018gender-neutral\u2019 use of\n\u2018man\u2019 as referring to either (a) a person or persons of\nunknown sex; or (b) males or a combination of males and females. This\nexplains why \u2018men\u2019 in (5) and \u2018man\u2019 in (6) are\nanomalous: these terms are being used to refer exclusively to persons\nknown to be female.\n\nThe supposed \u2018gender-neutral\u2019 meaning of these terms,\nthen, is not truly gender neutral. But, on its own, this does not show\nthat there is a problem with those uses that have traditionally been\nclassified as gender-neutral, as in sentences (3) and (4).\n(Discovering that we have misclassified an adjective as an adverb\nwould not show anything wrong with actual uses of the term in\nquestion.) Further reasons are needed in order to object to the use\nthat is made of these terms.\n",
