    "main_text": "Arguments Against Constructive Empiricism || Commitment to the Existence of Abstract Objects?\n3.9 Commitment to the Existence of Abstract Objects?\n\nRosen (1994, 164\u2013169) contends that a scientist cannot remain\nfaithful both to the epistemic standards of the empiricist at the same\ntime that she accepts various scientific theories in the way that the\nconstructive empiricist describes. If what Rosen says is correct, then\nconstructive empiricism fails as an explanation of how a committed\nempiricist can endorse the activity of science as rational.\n\nRosen\u2019s argument goes as follows. Using the terminology of van\nFraassen\u2019s semantic view of theories (described in Sec. 1.5\nabove), Rosen says an individual believing a theory to be empirically\nadequate\n\nis thereby committed to at least three sorts of abstract objects:\nmodels of the phenomena (data structures), the models that comprise\nT, and functions from the one to the other. To suspend\njudgment on the existence of abstract objects is therefore to suspend\njudgment on whether any theory is empirically adequate, and this just\n[is] to give up acceptance altogether. (166)\n\n\nIndeed, we would naturally suspect that a constructive empiricist\nwould suspend belief about the existence of abstract objects,\nwhich are unobservable entities if anything is. So it looks as if an\nempiricist cannot accept any scientific theories, if acceptance\namounts to what the constructive empiricist says it does.\n\nOne possible response the constructive empiricist might give here is a\nfictionalist account of mathematical objects. Embracing such a\nfictionalist view, an individual could use the theoretical apparatus\nof mathematics without committing herself to the existence of the\nobjects that are the alleged subject matter of mathematical theories.\nRosen (1994) considers this response but contends that it is not one\nthat a constructive empiricist may want to accept. The problem, Rosen\nsays, is that to embrace fictionalism about a theory T that\none accepts commits one to believing claims of the following form:\n\n(T\u2009\u2032) the world is such that if there were such\na thing as T, it would be empirically adequate (167).\n\n\nSuch a counterfactual-involving belief appears to commit the believer\nto the truth of certain modal facts, a commitment eschewed by the\ntypical Hume-inspired empiricist. Perhaps the constructive empiricist\ncan view the relevant counterfactuals as reducible to non-modal\nconditionals, in the spirit of the context-dependent reduction of\ncounterfactuals to non-modal conditionals entertained in section 3.5\nabove. If such a reduction can be successfully undertaken, the\nconstructive empiricist can avoid commitment to belief in the truth of\nthe relevant modal facts.\n\nWhether the constructive empiricist would ultimately want to endorse\nsome fictionalist view about mathematical objects is an open question.\nFor an attempt at developing a constructive empiricist philosophy of\nmathematics, see Bueno 1999.\n3.10 Resistance to characterizing science in terms of aims\n\nRowbottom (2019) contends that it would be wrong to characterize the\ndisagreement between the constructive empiricist and the scientific\nrealist as a debate about the aims of science. In extending his\ncritique, we might also be persuaded that constructive empiricism is\nmistaken in thinking that any philosophy of science ought centrally to\nbe about aims at all. In characterizing what science is, we should\ninstead focus on the many disparate activities and products of science\nitself, independent of any general aim or \u201cpoint\u201d to the activity. As\nRowbottom says,\n\n\nOne can learn how to perform various scientific tasks, and\nperform them well, without any explicit or implicit reference to an\nultimate or central \u2018point\u2019 of the exercise\u2014the\noverarching process\u2014of which they are a part. One may focus\ninstead on the immediate products of these tasks\u2026 \u2018What\nis science?\u2019 can be answered by pointing to those processes, how\nthey interact, and so forth. And what science can achieve may be\n(largely or wholly) independent of what its practitioners think it can\nachieve, or any rather mystical \u2018point\u2019 of the exercise\n(454\u2013455).\n\n\nA defender of constructive empiricism might suggest that unless we\nthink of the activity of science in relation to some aim or other, we\ncannot properly understand that activity; and unless we understand as\nunited under some general aim all the disparate many ways that science\nis undertaken, we cannot understand those many practices as parts\nof science (as opposed to, say, parts of religion or politics\nor \u2026). The activity is rendered intelligible only in light of\nthe point and purpose of undertaking it, and it is rendered\nintelligible as science only in light of a point or purpose\nshared with other activities regarded as scientific.\n\nAs van Fraassen (1994) puts it, \n\n\n[S]cientists with their very different motives and convictions\nparticipate in a common enterprise, defined by its own internal\ncriteria of success, and this success is their common aim\n\u2018inside\u2019 this cluster of diverging personal aim [sic]. How\nelse could they be said to be collaborating in a common enterprise?\nThe question is only what that defining criterion of success is\n(182).\n\n\nStill, even if we can offer an interpretation of science and its\nactivity as animated by a particular aim, which aim that is may be\nless important in characterizing science than the activity itself.\nRowbottom presses this point with the following thought\nexperiment:\n\n\nImagine members of an alien species, for whom acceptance\u2014or if\nyou prefer to reserve \u2018acceptance\u2019 for humans, call it\n\u2018a-acceptance\u2019\u2014involves belief neither in\n(approximate) truth nor empirical adequacy. (This might be due to\npsychological constraints. A-acceptance could instead involve belief\nin significant truth content, high problem-solving power,\napproximate empirical adequacy, and so on.) Would we want to say that\nthey were incapable of doing science? Or failing that, would we want\nto insist that they couldn\u2019t do anything with the\n\u2018character\u2019 of science? That would be strange. For they\ncould have institutions similar to our universities, and have theories\nsimilar to our scientific theories, arrived at by the use of\nsimilar procedures. They could also use these theories for exactly the\nsame purposes for which we use our scientific theories: to\nexplain the origins of the universe, to build spacecraft, and so forth\n(456). \n\n\nRowbottom here is, of course, describing theory acceptance. Insofar,\nthough, as a theory\u2019s acceptability is determined by the degree of the\ntheory\u2019s success at achieving a particular aim or aims, we can take\nthe point to be equally about aims. We can understand, that is, the\naliens as engaging in science even if they are not aiming for\nempirically adequate, or true, theories. In comparison to the activity\nitself, aims appear to be the less important thing to focus on in\ncharacterizing the activity as distinctively scientific.\n\nHow might a constructive empiricist reply? As noted in \u00a71.4\nabove, constructive empiricism is to be regarded as the best\ninterpretative account of the activity of science that renders it\nconsistent with the empiricist\u2019s own standards of rational\nactivity. It is, as van Fraassen (1994) says, what allow us to\n\u201cmake sense of those activities which we all agree are part\nof science\u201d (190). As such, it is not beholden to scientists\u2019 own\nprofessed aims in the activity the scientists undertake. Even if\nscientists\u2014alien or human\u2014regard themselves as being\nprincipally concerned with truth, or problem-solving, or predictive\nutility, none of those aims could be achieved without science being at\nleast minimally aimed at empirical adequacy for its theories. Positing\nempirical adequacy as the aim of science, then, allows the\nconstructive empiricist to best and most modestly make sense of the\nactivity of science. The variability of particular scientists\u2019\nindividual or collective aims does not undercut the singular and\nimportant role empirical adequacy plays in how we might\nphilosophically best interpret science and its many disparate\nactivities.",
