Equal Fundamental Human Worth\n\n\nEgalitarian justice doctrines rest on the fundamental premise that\nall persons have the same fundamental worth and dignity, which commands\nrespect. An aristocratic doctrine that held that all lords are\ninherently superior to commoners and hence ought to have greater rights\nand privileges would reject the basic equal human worth premise.\nHowever, acceptance of this fundamental or background egalitarian\npremise need not per se commit one to any very substantive egalitarian\nethic. Accepting basic equal human worth, one might cheerfully maintain\nthat the correct ethic is egoism, that each person ought to strive to\nbring about her own advantage as best she can. Or one might hold that\nthere is no moral requirement that the inhabitants of a political\ncommunity should share equally in political power or political rights,\nand no moral requirement that people who happen to become better off\nshould help the worse off.\n\n\nThe gap between equal fundamental human worth and a substantive\negalitarian ethic is exposed in Utilitarianism, chapter 5,\nwhen Mill avers that utilitarianism incorporates the fundamental\nprinciple of equality, that in the determination of what to do, each\nperson's interests should count exactly the same as any other\nperson's exactly similar interest. On this basis he denies that\nutilitarianism, the doctrine that one ought always to do whatever\nmaximizes aggregate utility, comes into conflict with the\nrecommendations for conduct of a justice norm of equality (Mill 1979).\nThe utilitarian rule \u201ceveryone to count for one, nobody for more\nthan one\u201d is already a substantive egalitarian norm, which goes\nbeyond the bare assertion of equal basic human worth. However, there\nare egalitarian doctrines that insist on equal treatment of persons in\nsome more robust sense, which neither equal basic moral worth nor\nutilitarian equal counting necessarily delivers. Some egalitarians\nmight hold that equal free speech rights or democratic rights for all\nshould be upheld even if denial of free speech or voting rights in\nparticular circumstances would lead to the greatest total of utility or\nhappiness. Some egalitarians might hold that it would be morally better\nto bring about a situation in which there is somewhat less aggregate\nutility (human good) dispersed equally among all people than an\nalternative situation in which the utility total is larger but its\ndistribution is extremely unequal across persons.\n\n\nThe assertion that all persons have equal basic moral worth is not\ntransparently clear. What is being asserted? I will try to elucidate\nthe idea by giving two examples of its application. A Lockean theory\nholds that all persons equally have certain natural moral rights. Just\nbeing a person confers on one the same package of rights that every\nother person possesses. One can perhaps forfeit some of these rights by\nbad conduct, but initially the protections the rights afford are the\nsame for all. If possession of rational agency capacity confers moral\nworth, and having this moral worth makes you a possessor of natural\nrights, equal worth gives everyone equal natural rights. For another\nexample, a utilitarian might also hold that being a person makes the\nfulfillment of your interests and the achievement of your good just as\nvaluable as the fulfillment and achievement of any other person's\nidentical welfare gains. Your good weighs the same as anyone\nelse's on the scale that determines what outcomes would be best\nand so what ought to be done (and a boost to any person's welfare\nmorally counts for more than an identical boost in welfare that instead\nmight be brought about for any lesser, nonperson sentient creature).\nWhat equal basic worth of persons implies regarding how persons should\nbe treated varies from moral theory to moral theory and depends on the\nstructure and content of the particular theory.\n\n\nThe assertion that all persons have equal basic moral worth and\ndignity calls out for justification or at least elucidation. What is it\nabout persons that renders them all morally equal in some fundamental\nsense? One proposal is that a being becomes morally considerable by\ngaining some capacity for rational agency, for thinking through what\nought to be done and setting one's will to do it, and that if one\nattains rational agency capacity at a certain threshold level, one\nbecomes a full person, and further increases in rational agency above\nthat threshold line that some might attain would not affect one's\nfundamental status of being a person with the same worth and dignity\npossessed by all other persons (Nozick 1974, chapter 3).\n\n\nThis proposal has the attractive feature that it treats evenhandedly\nmembers of the human species and members of any other species of being\nthere might be anywhere in the universe. If any beings possess rational\nagency capacity at a threshold level, they are persons and have the\nmoral worth and dignity that attaches to persons. The proposal also\nprovides an attractive approach to the issue of what rights and duties\nhumans and other animals have with respect to each other. The proposal\nsuggests that the more it is the case that an individual being attains\nsome degree of rational agency capacity, below the threshold of full\npersonhood, the more morally considerable that being is.\n\n\nThough attractive, the proposal faces difficulties that have not so\nfar been solved. One initial difficulty is to specify and justify the\nthreshold that marks the personhood boundary. There are evidently\ndifferent components of rational agency capacity, such as the ability\nto perceive features of one's environment, the ability to\nrecognize and assess reasons for choice, the ability to deliberate and\nchoose, the ability to form intentions and carry through what one has\ndecided, and so on. To speak of rational agency capacity as one\ncapacity presupposes some way of adding together an individual's\ncomponent ability levels into one overall capacity. Then there is a\nline drawing problem: What justifies identifying the level of capacity\nthat marks one as a person here rather than there? A perhaps more\ntroublesome difficulty is that it is not at all obvious why the fact\nthat people differ in their attainment of rational agency capacity\nabove the threshold of personhood does not bring about difference in\ntheir fundamental moral status. Why doesn't the fact that you\npossess more of the very capacities for reasoning, insight, choice, and\neffective volition that qualified us as persons than I do render it the\ncase that you are morally more considerable than I, have a higher\nfundamental moral worth? (see Carter 2011 and Waldron 2003). There is\nthe further question how to determine what degree of moral worth or\nmoral considerability attaches to beings who possess some rational\nagency capacities below the threshold level, or who possess capacities\nof some other sort such as bare sentience that should be regarded as\nmoral considerability qualifications. And finally, Peter Vallentyne\nposes yet another worry (Vallentyne 2007). Suppose that we take\nrational agency capacity to be the basis of personhood. What then do we\nsay about newborn human infants or normal young human children, who\nsurely lack rational agency capacity at any plausible threshold level.\nIf we say, the newborn human is a potential person, hence entitled to\nrights close to those of persons, the problem arises that in the\nfuture, when we have better genetic therapies available, and by\napplying expensive genetic treatment to a normal mouse, could endow it\nwith rational agency capacity, the normal mouse looks likely to qualify\nas a potential person if the newborn or young human does.\n",
