    "main_text": "Overview\n1. Overview\n\nThe notion of a sortal overlaps with significant and long unresolved\nphilosophical controversies in philosophy of language, metaphysics and\nphilosophy of mind. Philosophers disagree about whether there are\nessences and those who agree that there are disagree about whether\nessences exist at a very general level\u2014animal\u2014or\na specific level\u2014tiger. And philosophers disagree about\ncriteria of identity. Some believe that criteria of identity are\nrelative to a sortal in ways that can conflict, two things might be\nthe same ship but not the same wood. Others believe that identity\nconditions vary by sortal but do not conflict\u2014that the criteria\nfor the identity of ships is different from that for people but since\npeople are not ships, the answers could not conflict. Others believe\nthere is only one general identity criterion regardless of sortal, and\nothers argue that there are no identity criteria. On one extreme view\n(Sider 1996), nothing exists at more than an instant. We, like most of\nthe literature on sortals, will not take that view into account in\nwhat follows.\n\nMost, though not all (Geach, Lowe) agree that sortal words apply to\nthings that we can count rather than things we measure. Sortals go\nwith numbers and plurals. \u201cDog\u201d is a sortal,\n\u201cwater\u201d is not, so we say that we need two\ndogs but that we need more water. One confusing\naspect of the distinction is that although \u201cwater\u201d is not\na sortal, there is often a tacitly understood qualifier in the context\nthat combines to provide a sortal. At the grocery store, we might say\nwe need two waters meaning two bottles of water; or in a\nrestaurant we might ask for two waters, meaning two more\nglasses of water. So although \u201cwater\u201d is not a\nsortal, the phrase \u201cbottle of water\u201d is, at least in one\nsense of the term. There are also quirks of language, English speakers\ndecide how many vegetables to buy, but Germans consider\nhow much Gemuse to buy, in spite of the fact that\n\u201cGemuse\u201d means vegetable.\n\nThe counting characterization of what a sortal is includes many varied\nforms; we can count dogs, brown dogs, old brown dogs, old brown\ndachshunds, breeds of dog. But at most one of these characterizes the\nessence of the things we are counting. When being careful,\nphilosophers call this subset essential sortals. But not everyone is always careful. Also, there is a deep disagreement over whether the entire concept of an essence makes sense \nand so there are debates over whether there are a special subcategory\nof essential sortals. For example, both Brody(1980) and Wiggins(2001) argue for there being essential sortals, while Mackie(2006) against it. And among those who hold that there are essential sortals, there is disagreement over whether these are at a\ngeneral level such as \u201canimal\u201d or a specific level such as\n\u201cdog\u201d\n\nOne point of agreement is that we must have a sortal in mind for\ncounting to make sense. If we are looking at a barnyard and asked to\ncount how many, we need to know what sort of thing we are counting. We\ncould count animals or chickens or goats or tables or legs. Sortals\nspecify the \u201ckind of thing we are counting\u201d and thus are\nassociated with counting and a number. They contrast with other terms\nthat involve measuring and an amount. Linguists distinguish count\nnouns, nouns that go with \u201cHow many?\u201d and take plurals,\nfrom mass nouns that go with \u201cHow much?\u201d and do not take plurals,\nConfusingly, many nouns have both a count and a mass meaning, so we\ncan ask both how many chickens the farmer owns and\nhow much chicken you would like on your plate.?\n\nOften in order to count we also need to know when we have the same\nthing and when we have another, so sortals are also involved with\nidentity. Identity questions are usually easy to answer when we are\ndiscussing currently existing things, though for very large objects\nthe question can be tricky: Is the river that flows through Peoria\nIllinois the same one that flows through New Orleans? \n\nQuestions of identity through time are more often difficult, because\nthey involve issues of persistence. If a kitten grows up it ceases to\nbe a kitten but it is the same cat and the same animal. But if we tear\ndown our garage and build a tree house out of the lumber it is not the\nsame building. When does something survive change and when not? Which\nkinds of changes? Sortals providing criteria for continued existence through time (or so-called \u201cpersistence criteria\u201d) are often referred as \u201csubstance sortals\u201d. By their features, essential sortals will clearly qualify as substance sortals but not necessarily vice-versa. Similarly to the case of essential sortals, there are systematic disagreements among philosophers whether the substance sortals are to be located at a\nrelatively specific level, e.g., \u201cdog\u201d,\n\u201criver\u201d or at the level of a more general category, e.g., \u201canimal\u201d, \u201cgeographic feature\u201d.\n\nIn considering sortals, counting, and identity, it is important to\nbear in mind that the superficial forms of language use can hide\ncomplexity. For example, if we say that Sam and Maria own the same\ncar, we probably do not mean that they are co-owners, but that they\neach own a car and that those cars are instances of the same model.\nWhat appears to be a question of identity between objects is actually\na question of identity between kinds of cars.\n\nBut there are real, famous historical issues about identity that lead\nto disagreements about the relation between essential sortals and\nidentity. Some philosophers believe that there is a unique universal\nidentity relation which holds, or doesn\u2019t, independently of any\nsortals. Others argue that identity is always relative to a sortal\nbecause we may have a statue of Lincoln which is a different statue\nthan one of Caesar even though the lump of bronze from which the first\nwas made is the same lump of bronze that constitutes the second. So in\nthis case, the sortals \u201cstatue\u201d and \u201clump of\nbronze\u201d give different answers to the identity question.\n\nWhile there is considerable agreement that sortals \u201cprovide a\ncriterion of identity\u201d there is disagreement on what is required\nfor a criterion of identity. Some philosophers have more stringent\nexpectations than others requiring that the statement of the criterion\nnot use terms involving the sortals in question or similar terms.\nAlso, as noted above some philosophers believe there is only one\nuniversal identity relation independent of sortals, and while others\nargue that there are no criteria of identity.\n\nAs a final preliminary to our more detailed history and analysis, we\nnote that there is important variation between authors in whether\n\u201csortal\u201d is applied to linguistic items, e.g.,\nwords like \u201ccat\u201d or \u201clake\u201d or\n\u201ccloud\u201d; abstract entities such as the property of\nbeing a cat or of being a lake or a cloud; or to psychological entities\nsuch as the idea or concept of a cat or lake or\ncloud. The first interpretation views sortals as being linguistically determined.The second sees sortal categories as part\nof the world\u2019s furniture independent of how we describe it, and\nthe last is associated with a range of positions in between. These three different interpretations of the nature of sortals have been labeled as nominalist, realist, and conceptualist, respectively. Work on sortals may, in general, be classified under one of these three categories.\n",
