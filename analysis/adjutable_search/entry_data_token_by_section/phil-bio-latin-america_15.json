    "main_text": "Philosophy and History of Biology || Historico-epistemological Analyses\n5.3 Historico-epistemological Analyses\n\nOne of the most important and influential proposals for a\nphilosophical history of science or a historical epistemology in Latin\nAmerica is that of Mexican biologist, philosopher, and historian of\nscience Carlos L\u00f3pez Beltr\u00e1n, already mentioned in\n Section 3.\n Good examples of his work in this direction are provided by his\nseries of publications (L\u00f3pez Beltr\u00e1n 1994, 1995, 2004a,\n2004b, 2007), in which he carries out a conceptual history\n\u00e0 la Canguilhem by analyzing the historical\nstructuration of the concept of biological heredity, stressing in\nparticular the role played by the medical and alienist tradition, and\nnot only the significance of the traditions of hybridists, breeders,\nMendelians, and biometricians.\n\nStudies within the historico-epistemological tradition are also\nconducted by Mexican biologist, philosopher, and historian of science\nEdna Su\u00e1rez-D\u00edaz. Significant contributions include her\n1960s\u20131970s analysis of the case of molecular evolution as a\nprocess of integration of different types of traditions, including\ntheoretical, experimental, and descriptive, that share a scientific\ndomain, in which the concepts of molecular clock and informational\nmolecules played a central role (Su\u00e1rez-D\u00edaz 1995,\n2009); and her Rheinbergerian study of the construction of\nsatellite-DNA and the evolution of nucleic acid hybridization, which\nillustrates the close relationship existing between the evolution of\ntechniques and the stabilization of phenomena in experimental biology\n(Su\u00e1rez-D\u00edaz 2001).\n\nFrom a perspective that combines history, philosophy, and sociology of\nscience, Mexican Vivette Garc\u00eda-Deister, mentioned in\n Section 3,\n argues that models of genetic regulation do not replace each other as\nthey solve problems but rather are provisional answers to questions\nposed by scientists in a given context, attending to the establishment\nand use of the three types of technologies distinguished by Shapin and\nSchaffer (1985) in their study of Boyle: the material, the literary,\nand the social technological (Garc\u00eda-Deister 2013).\n\nTaking his interest in evolutionary biology as a starting point and\nconvinced of the relevance of epistemological history as an\nindispensable form of philosophical analysis of scientific discourse,\nArgentine-born and Brazil-based philosopher and historian of biology\nGustavo Caponi, mentioned in\n Section 3,\n has developed one of the most prolific bodies of work in Latin\nAmerica from this approach. In an attempt to better understand the\nprocess of naturalization of teleology operated by the theory of\nnatural selection, and to have a point of comparison with the\nDarwinian formulation of the idea of adaptation, he begins a series of\nhistorico-epistemological analyses \u00e0 la Canguilhem\naimed at understanding the way in which organic teleology was\nconsidered in pre-Darwinian Natural History. He also aims to correct\ncertain historiographical myths, such as Cuvier\u2019s or\nLamarck\u2019s supposed adaptationism and Alfred Russel\nWallace\u2019s putative discovery of the theory of natural selection.\nSome of the most significant results of his historico-epistemological\nresearch are found in his books on Cuvier (Caponi 2008), on Buffon\n(Caponi 2010), and in his epistemological history of the adaptationist\nprogram (Caponi 2011), in the account of which he uses Toulmin\u2019s\nconcept of ideal of natural order.\n\nMoreover, in a kind of historical epistemology from a\nconceptual-philosophical point of view, Brazilian Maur\u00edcio de\nCarvalho Ramos addresses history of biology. He published several\npapers of this type of analysis, especially applied to cases taken\nfrom the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, in particular the\nnatural philosophy of Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis, regarding\nwhich Ramos analyzes the trajectory of his natural philosophy linked\nto Newtonianism, showing that he formulated the principle of minimum\naction and that his theory of organic generation brought a new\napproach to issues related to crossbreeding and hybridization, the\nproduction of malformations, and the transformation of races and\nspecies (Ramos 2003, 2004, 2005, 2009).\n\nAfter a historical review of the gene as an instrumental concept and\nthe advent of a realist view and genes as units in Mendelian genetics\nto the classical concept of the molecular gene, Charbel El-Hani\n(2007), mentioned in\n Section 4.3\n and\n Section 5.2\n and known for his work at the intersections between philosophy,\nhistory, and education of biology and his important contributions to\nbiosemantics, calls attention to the crossroads at which the concept\nof gene finds itself: on the one hand, being at risk of being erased\nfrom the genetic vocabulary and, on the other, benefiting from efforts\nto save it from this fate. El-Hani advocates maintaining this concept,\nbut considers that the unit concept should be dispensed with, and\nthat, regarding the generality of biological concepts, gene included,\nit should be considered on a restricted domain of application\nsimilarly to what Weber (1999) argues for biological laws, paving the\nway for a new and possibly pluralistic understanding of what a gene\nis.\n\nFollowing another line of research within the\nhistorico-epistemological analyses, Brazilian biologist and historian\nMaria Elice Brzezinski Prestes, who also works at the intersections\nbetween philosophy, history, and education of biology, focuses her\nwork on methodological and philosophical aspects of observation and\nexperimentation in the history of biology, especially on the\ndevelopment of the experimental method in the modern age. Her research\non Lazzaro Spallanzani tends to correlate methodological, empirical,\nand conceptual considerations of Spallanzani\u2019s studies on plant\nand animal reproduction, striving to offer an epistemological\nfoundation that shows the autonomy of research on living beings in the\neighteenth century, as well as to provide new evidence of the\nconsolidation of the experimental method developed by the Italian\nnaturalist, whose perspective of tracing analogies allowed the\nunification of these two \u201cgreat groups of organized\nbeings\u201d (Prestes 2006; Prestes & Russo 2008).\n",
