Human good,\nalso known as welfare or well-being or utility, is what an individual\ngets insofar as her life goes well for herself (Parfit 1984, Appendix\nI).). This awkward phrase is meant to distinguish one's life going well\nfor oneself, as one would wish one's life to go from the standpoint of\nrational prudence, and its going well by way of producing good that\nenters the lives of other people or animals or fulfills some impersonal\ngood cause. Suppose my life in its entirety consists in sticking my\nfinger in a dike and slowly painfully freezing to death, like the\nlittle Dutch boy in the children's fable. So lived, this life produces\nlots of good for millions of people saved from flood and drowning, but\nfor me it produces no good, just slow misery. The life just imagined is\na good in the sense of morally admirable life but not a life that\ncontains much welfare or human good for the one living it.\n\n\nThe background thought is then that morality is concerned with the\nproduction and fair distribution of human good. Nothing else ultimately\nmatters (except animal and nonhuman person welfare, but leave these\nimportant qualifications aside). So to the extent we believe that fair\ndistribution is equal distribution, that morality requires that\neveryone get the same, what everyone should then have the same\nof is human good or welfare or well-being.\n\n\nTo work out this conception of equality of condition would involve\ndetermining what account of the nature of human good is most plausible.\nOne account is hedonism, which holds the good to be pleasure and\nabsence of pain. Pleasure and the absence of pain might be identified\nwith happiness, but there are alternative accounts of happiness. For\nexample, one might hold that a person is happy at a time just in case\nshe is satisfied with how her life is going at that time, and happy\nregarding her life as a whole up to now to the degree she is satisfied\nwith how her life has gone as a whole up to now. If one identifies the\ngood with happiness according to this or another construal of what it\nis to be happy, we have a non-hedonic happiness account of human good\n(Sumner 1996, Haybron 2008, and Feldman 2010). Another account\nidentifies the good with desire satisfaction or life aim fulfillment. A\nvariant of this last approach holds that the relevant aims and desires\nare those that would withstand ideal reflection with full information\nunmarred by cognitive error (such as adding two and two and getting\nfive). A quite different account supposes that the good is constituted\nby the items on a list of objectively valuable beings and doings. The\nmore the individual attains the items on the objective list over the\ncourse of her life, the better her life goes, whatever her subjective\nopinions and attitudes about such attainments might be. There are also\nhybrid views, such as that the good is valuable achievement that one\nenjoys, or that the good is getting what one wants for its own sake in\nso far as what one wants and gets is also objectively valuable (Parfit\n1984, Appendix I; Adams 1999, chapter 3). The most plausible conception\nof the ideal of equality of welfare incorporates whatever is the best\ntheory of human good or welfare. (In this connection see Griffin 1986\nand Hurka 1990.)\n\n\nAny such account bumps into problems concerning personal\nresponsibility and the sense that the obligations of society are\nlimited\u2014problems already mentioned in this discussion. A society\nbent on sustaining equality of welfare would continue pouring resources\ndown the drain if worse off individuals insist on negligently\nsquandering whatever resources are expended on them in order to boost\ntheir welfare level up to the average level. One might respond to this\nresponsibility challenge by stipulating that equality is only desirable\non the condition that individuals are equally responsible or deserving:\nIt is bad if some are worse off than others through no fault or choice\nof their own. In a slogan, one might assert an ideal of equality of\nopportunity for welfare. (See Cohen 1989, Arneson 1989, and for\ncriticism Rakowski 1992, Fleurbaey 1995, Scanlon 1997, and Wolff\n1998).\n\n\nAnother criticism does not so much challenge the welfarist\ninterpretation of equality of condition but presses the issue, how much\nweight any such equality of condition ideal should have in competition\nwith other values. Imagine for example that some people, the severely\ndisabled, are far worse off than others, and are through no fault or\nchoice of their own extremely poor transformers of resources into\nwelfare. A society bent on sustaining equality of welfare or equal\nopportunity for welfare as a first priority would be obligated to\ncontinue transferring resources from better off to worse off no matter\nhow many better off people must then suffer any amount of welfare loss\njust so long as the pertinent welfare condition of a single still worse\noff individual can be improved even by a tiny amount.\n\n\nAnother criticism challenges the welfarist conceptions of equality\nof condition directly. One observes that in a diverse modern society,\nindividuals will reasonably disagree about what is ultimately good and\nworthwhile in human life. Hence no conception of welfare is available\nto serve as a consensus standard for a public morality acceptable to\nall reasonable persons. In a similar spirit, one might invoke the idea\nthat responsible individuals cannot acquiesce in the assumption of the\nresponsibility on the part of the government to determine what is\nworthwhile and choiceworthy for them, for this responsibility rests\nsquarely on each individual's shoulders and cannot legitimately be\ndislodged from that perch. (See especially Dworkin, 2000, chapter 7,\nalso Arneson 2000.)\n\n\nNotice that equality of welfare and equal opportunity for welfare do\nnot exhaust the welfarist egalitarian alternatives. Take the example of\na view that is oriented to equality of perfectionist achievement\n(achievement of objectively valuable achievements of a kind that make\none's life go better for oneself). One might hold that what is\nmorally valuable and ought to be promoted is equality of achievement,\nor equal opportunity for achievement, or another view along the lines\nof equal achievement of one's potential or equal opportunity to\nachieve one's potential. Say that each person has a native talent\nfor achievement. I have little native talent; you have a lot.\nEgalitarianism might be construed as requiring that so far as is\npossible, social arrangements be set so that each of us achieves, or\ncan achieve, the same percentage of his native potential over the\ncourse of her life. Everyone's ratio of actual achievement to\nnative potential for achievement should be the same. So my having the\nopportunity to achieve little, and my actually achieving little,\ncompared to you, on this conception would not necessarily offend\nagainst the egalitarian ideal (see McMahan 1996, and for the thought\nthat measurement of achievements on a single scale is chimerical, Raz\n1986).\n",
