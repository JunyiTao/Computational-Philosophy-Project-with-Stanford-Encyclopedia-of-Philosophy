    "main_text": "\n\nOmnipotence is maximal power. Maximal greatness (or perfection)\nincludes omnipotence. According to traditional Western theism, God is\nmaximally great (or perfect), and therefore is omnipotent. Omnipotence\nseems puzzling, even paradoxical, to many philosophers. They wonder,\nfor example, whether God can create a spherical cube, or make a stone\nso massive that he cannot move it. Is there a consistent analysis of\nomnipotence? What are the implications of such an analysis for the\nnature of God?\n",
