    "main_text": "PH II and III; M VII\u2013XI || The criterion of truth\n4.1 The criterion of truth\n\n\nThe most important part of PH II is the long discussion\nof the \u2018criterion\u2019 (or \u2018standard\u2019, as Annas and\nBarnes translate it) of truth (see especially Striker 1974: 1990b;\nBrunschwig 1988). Not only is it philosophically extremely rich,\nbut it plays a crucial role in the dialectic of the contemporary scholarly debate as to\nwhether the Pyrrhonian skeptic can have beliefs. The notion of a\ncriterion of truth was central to the epistemologies of both the Stoics\nand Epicureans:\n \nThe problem of the criterion of truth\u2026 is\nthe problem of how we discover or ascertain the truth\u2014the truth\nthat we need to find in order to attain knowledge. (Striker\n1990b: 151)\n \n The Epicureans and the Stoics had slightly different\ncandidates for what the criteria of truth would be.\n \nEpicurus\u2019 criteria were taken to be primitive truths, that\nis, ones that had to be accepted without proof or further\nargument; (Striker 1990b: 152)\n \nthese are the truths delivered by\nsense-impressions, preconceptions, and feelings (DL X 31), which would\nthen be used to work out the truth of non-primitive propositions. The\nStoics thought that the criteria of truth were special kinds of\nimpressions, so-called \u2018cognitive impressions\u2019, which were\nof such a nature so as to guarantee their own truth (roughly speaking,\nthey \u2018come about from what is\u2019 (DL VII 46) and are clear\nand distinct (see Frede 1983: 164)); they could also be used to work\nout the truth of other, unclear, matters. These two conceptions of the\ncriterion, the Epicurean and the Stoic, were christened the\n\u2018adelic\u2019 and \u2018prodelic\u2019 conceptions by\nBrunschwig (1988: 230\u2013233). (The terms \u2018adelic\u2019 and\n\u2018prodelic\u2019 derive from the Greek words\nad\u00ealon and prod\u00ealon, meaning\n\u2018unclear\u2019 and \u2018clear\u2019 respectively; thus, the\n\u2018adelic\u2019 conception of the criterion of truth is the one\nwhich emphasizes the role of the criterion in the discovery of\nunclear things, whereas the \u2018prodelic\u2019 conception\nis the one which emphasizes that those truths delivered by the\ncriterion are clearly true.) Brunschwig shows in detail that\nSextus conflates the two in his arguments against the criterion,\nalthough he acknowledges that this conflation does not dent the force\nof the objections that Sextus brings.\n\n\nSome of the flavour of Sextus\u2019 objections to the criterion can\nbe gleaned from the following passage (PH II 74\u20135):\n\n\n[74] Nor can we say that the soul apprehends external\nexisting objects through its sensory feelings inasmuch as the feelings\nof the senses are similar to the external existing objects. For how\nwill the intellect know whether the feelings of the senses are like the\nsense-objects, given that it does not itself come into contact with the\nexternal objects and that the senses make clear to it not the nature of\nthese objects but their own feelings, as we deduced from the modes of\nsuspension? [75] Just as someone who does not know Socrates but has\nlooked at a picture of him does not know whether the picture is like\nSocrates, so the intellect, studying the feelings of the senses but not\nobserving the external objects, will not know whether the feelings of\nthe senses are like the external existing objects. Therefore it cannot\nrely on similarity to judge them.\n\n\n\nRoughly speaking, Sextus is pointing out to the Epicureans and the\nStoics, both of whom attach great weight to the deliverance of the\nsenses, that there is no way that one\u2019s intellect can distinguish\namongst impressions those ones which are faithful to the way the world\nis: one only has access to one\u2019s impressions, and not the\nexternal world, so one cannot discern which of one\u2019s impressions\nare faithful to the external world, and assent to them alone. The\nintellect is impotent when it comes to deciding whether perceptual\nimpressions are to be an adequate criterion. (Sextus might be\nmisunderstanding the Stoic position here; see Frede 1983.)\n\n\nAt the end of Sextus\u2019 discussion in PH II, he clearly\nsignals, as one would expect, that he suspends judgment on whether\nthere are criteria of truth:\n\nYou must realize that it is not our\nintention to assert that standards of truth are unreal (that would be\ndogmatic); rather, since the Dogmatists seem plausibly to have\nestablished that there is a standard of truth, we have set up\nplausible-seeming arguments in opposition to them, affirming neither\nthat they are true nor that they are more plausible than those on the\ncontrary side, but concluding to suspension of judgement because of the\napparently equal plausibility of these arguments and those produced by\nthe Dogmatists. (PH II 79; cf. M VII 444)\n\n\nHow does Sextus\u2019 treatment of the criterion contribute to the\ndebate between scholars over the question of whether the Skeptic has\nany beliefs? The answer is that both Jonathan Barnes and Myles Burnyeat\nhave used Sextus\u2019 discussion of the criterion as a means of\nsecuring the conclusion that the Skeptic has no beliefs at all. Recall\nthat in PH I 13, Sextus says there are two meanings of the\nword dogma, according to the first of which the Skeptic\ndoes have dogmata, and according to the second of\nwhich, the Skeptic does not have dogmata. All\ncommentators are in agreement that the second kind of dogma is\nroughly to be understood as a \u2018philosophico-scientific\u2019\nopinion or tenet (Barnes 1982: 67), even if the parties to the debate\nhave a slightly different understanding of what a\n\u2018philosophico-scientific tenet\u2019 is (Morison 2011: 265\u20137).\nThe question is what kind of belief (if any kind at all) the first kind\nof dogma is. According to Barnes and Burnyeat, this first kind\nof dogma is something like the Skeptic\u2019s acknowledgment\nof his occurrent state of being appeared to in a certain way. Clearly,\naccording to Barnes and Burnyeat, this leaves a gap in Sextus\u2019\npresentation: \n what attitude does he take to ordinary beliefs?  The\nsentences of breakfast-time, bath-time, and bed-time\u2014\u2018The\nbutter\u2019s hard\u2019, \u2018The water\u2019s cold\u2019, \u2018The\nsprings are protruding\u2019\u2014do not express scientific\n \u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, nor\nyet do they serve in avowals. If we are concerned to discover the\nscope of \u1f10\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae in\nPH, it is precisely such humdrum sentences which will most\nexercise us; yet of them Sextus says nothing. (Barnes 1982:\n75\u20136)\n\n\nBoth Barnes and Burnyeat end up claiming that these ordinary\neveryday beliefs actually end up being discarded along with the\ndogmata in the second sense. They argue this by claiming that\nSextus does not have a criterion of truth: the Skeptic \n needs a criterion of truth, to determine which [of\nconflicting appearances] he should accept. But the sceptic then\nargues, often at some length, that there is no intellectually\nsatisfying criterion we can trust and use\u2014this is the real\nbackbone of the discussion. (Burnyeat 1980: 29)\n\nBarnes puts it as follows: \n\nwe cannot affirm\nthat the water is tepid unless we have a criterion of truth\u2014a\nway of judging that the \n\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 with which\nthe water affects us corresponds to the actual state of the\nwater; (1982: 77) \n\nBut the thesis that there is a\ncriterion of truth is itself a\n\u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u2014indeed, it is a perfect specimen of those philosophico-scientific\ntenets which the Greeks called\n\u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1; (78)\n\n\nOrdinary beliefs are not\n\u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u2026 Nonetheless, in\nrejecting \u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 the Pyrrhonist\nmust reject ordinary beliefs; for the possession of ordinary beliefs\npresupposes the possession of at least one\n\u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u2014the\n\u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 that there is a criterion of\ntruth. (ibid) (Cf. Burnyeat 1984: 115n. 36)\n\n\nBarnes\u2019 argument, however, is fallacious (for more detailed\ndiscussion, see Schwab 2013, whose main points are summarised here).\nThere are two fundamental flaws. First, the Hellenistic theory of the\ncriterion of truth was never supposed to be a theory about how\nbeliefs in general are formed, only beliefs which meet the\ncondition of being suitable for conferring knowledge. But second, and\nmore importantly, one needs to distinguish between suspending\njudgment on whether there is a criterion of truth, and failing\nto have a criterion of truth. Since the deliverances of the\nnatural capacity of perception are criteria of truth according to the\nEpicureans, there is nothing one can do, short of putting one\u2019s\neyes out, to bring it about that one lacks this criterion of truth;\nmerely suspending judgment on whether there is such a thing as a\ncriterion of truth won\u2019t do the job. Similarly, since it is\ncognitive impressions, according to the Stoics, which are criteria of\ntruth, there is nothing one can do to bring it about that one lacks\nthese criteria of truth, short of damaging one\u2019s capacity for\nforming impressions (one\u2019s phantasia); merely suspending\njudgment on whether there is a criterion of truth won\u2019t do the\njob. Barnes actually acknowledges this flaw in his argument in a\nfootnote: \n\n\nThe Pyrrhonian may possess a criterion even\nif he himself does not believe that he does; and in that case\nhe is in a position to judge that p (1982: 78n. 76)\n\n\nIn short, Barnes\u2019 and Burnyeat\u2019s appeal to the\ndiscussion of the criterion of truth is unconvincing as an attempt to\nshow that for the Pyrrhonian Skeptic, ordinary beliefs are off limits.\nThe urbane interpretation is still standing.\n",
