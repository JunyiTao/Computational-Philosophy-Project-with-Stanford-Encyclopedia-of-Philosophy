    "main_text": "Mereology and metaphysics || Identity\n4.1 Identity\n\nMedieval philosophers think that no part is identical to its\n whole.[5]\n The reasons why this is true are as varied as the types of parts and\nwholes themselves. If x is a quantitative part of y,\nthen x is lesser in quantity than y. A\ndonkey\u2019s form is not identical to the donkey, because this\ndonkey is a composite of the donkey\u2019s form and something\nelse, namely, the donkey\u2019s matter. Socrates\u2019 soul is\nnot identical to the human being who is Socrates, for the human being\nis a composite of body and soul. Socrates is not a universal, even\nthough he is a human being. And the extension of Animal is greater\nthan the extension of Human Being.\n\nHowever, there is another question that does divide medieval\nphilosophers. Consider an integral whole. An integral whole is\ncomposed out of its parts. But is it true that an integral whole is no\nthing other than the sum of these parts? Some philosophers, such as\nAbelard and Ockham, argue that the whole is no thing other than the\nsum of its parts. Others, such as Duns Scotus, argue that the whole is\nsome thing which is really distinct from the sum of its parts. (On the\ndebate between Ockham and Scotus, see Cross 1995, Cross 1999, and\nNormore 2006.) The former philosophers perhaps base their position on\npassages from Boethius\u2019 treatments of mereology such as\nthis:\n\nEvery thing is the same as the whole. For example, Rome is the same as\nthat which is the whole citizenry. Each and every thing is also the\nsame as all its parts when they are gathered together into a unity.\nFor example, a man is the same as the head, throat, belly, feet, and\nthe rest of the parts gathered together and conjoined into a unity.\n(In Cic. top. 285.24\u201328)\n\n\nThose who claim that the whole is not identical to its parts often\nappeal to Aristotle. For example, an anonymous commentator on\nAristotle\u2019s Sophistical Refutations argues that\n\u201cthe five are not the two and the three\u201d on the grounds\nthat Aristotle has shown in his Metaphysics that \u201cthe\ncomposite, in general, is something other than its component\nparts\u201d (Quaestiones super Sophisticos Elenchos q. 831\n[1977, 346]; cf. Aristotle Metaphysics 8.6,\n1045a9\u201310).\n\nPeter Abelard provides one of the most sophisticated solutions to this\nproblem. Abelard emphatically asserts that the whole is no thing other\nthan the sum of its parts (Dialectica 344.34\u20135, and\n550.6\u20137; cf. 560.34\u2013561.2). But this is surely false.\nConsider a house. A house is composed out of a specific sum of boards\nand bricks. Yet these boards and bricks could be sitting together on\nthe building site without being arranged as a house. Hence, it is hard\nto see how the house is no thing other than the sum of the parts.\n\nAbelard will respond by drawing a distinction between the\nessentia, or concrete being, of a thing and the\n\u201cconditions\u201d (status) which a thing may possess\nor be in. True, the sum of boards and bricks must possess the\nappropriate arrangement in order to be a house (Logica\nIngredientibus II, 171.14\u201317; and Dialectica\n550.36\u2013551.4). But when the sum takes on a specific structure it\ndoes not take on an extra part. Whatever they are, Abelard makes it\nvery clear that structures and arrangements like those found in houses\nare not things (res), and only things can be parts.\nThe imposition of a structure upon the sum of the boards and bricks\ndoes not add a part to the thing that is that sum, and hence, the sum\nof the boards and bricks is the same in essentia as the\nhouse\u2014they are the very same thing. Nevertheless, there\ncan be different conditions in which this thing is. When the sum of\nboards and bricks are arranged in one way, they are in the condition\nof being a house. When they are arranged in other ways, they are not\nin this condition. In short, to claim that the house is no thing other\nthan the sum of its parts does not imply that the sum is in the state\nof being a house when the sum exists.\n\nAbelard\u2019s solution will only work if he can motivate the claim\nthat a thing taking on a new condition does not make a new thing.\nAnd medieval realists went after such reductivist programs in much the\nsame way that some contemporary realists do. Specifically, they often\npresented truth-maker challenges, or \u201canti-Razor\u201d\narguments (see Maurer 1984): If at one time this sum of boards and\nbricks is not a house and at another time it is a house, then there\nmust be some item in reality, some thing, that is absent at the\nformer time and present at the later time. The task, of course, is to\nidentify the right sort of thing that can be such a difference\nmaker.\n\nBut let us move on to consider another related puzzle about identity\nat a time. Abelard\u2019s characterization of numerical sameness and\ndifference seems to give us the tools to answer a common medieval\npuzzle which I will call the Problem of the Many Men. Versions of this\nproblem can be found in a number of medieval works (see, e.g., Abelard\nTheologia Christiana III, \u00a7 153 (1969, 252); William of\nSherwood Syncategoremata (O\u2019Donnell ed., 60); Albert of\nSaxony Quaestiones in Physicam I, qq. 7\u20138, and his\nSophismata 46, 25va\u2013vb). The puzzle can easily be generated\nusing a crude understanding of numerical sameness. Assume that\nSocrates\u2019 body is perfectly intact: he has all his limbs, and\ntheir parts. Now consider every part of Socrates\u2019 body except\none finger. Call this whole W. W is not numerically\nthe same as Socrates, so it appears that they must be numerically\ndistinct. Socrates\u2019 whole body is imbued with the soul of a man.\nBut it also happens that W is imbued with the soul of a man.\nSo, there are now two numerically distinct men where it initially\nappeared there was one. But it gets worse. Considering the body apart\nfrom one finger was only one of an indefinite number of such\nconsiderations. And by the same reasoning, these other bracketed\nwholes composed from Socrates\u2019 body are also men. Hence, it is\neasy to generate an indefinite number of numerically distinct men\nwhere commonsense tells us that there is only one.\n\nAbelard might appear to be capable of unraveling this puzzle\nby employing his distinction between difference in essentia\nand numerical difference, which he presents most clearly in his\nanalysis of the Trinity (Theologia Christiana III, \u00a7 139\nand \u00a7148 (1969, 247 and 250\u20131); see Brower 2004,\n226\u201334). Abelard\u2019s notion of sameness and difference\nin essentia is informed by his appreciation of the\nnotion of mereological overlap (see the section on Basic\nPrinciples/Other Mereological Concepts, in the entry on\n mereology).\n His appreciation of mereological overlap in and of itself is a\nwatershed, since he is one of the first (and perhaps one of the few)\nmedieval philosophers to clearly understand this\n phenomenon.[6]\n According to Abelard, x is the same in essentia as\ny if and only if every part of x is a part of\ny and every part of y is a part of x. In\nother words, x is the same in essentia as y\nif and only if x and y mereologically coincide. If\nx is the same in essentia as y, then\nx is numerically the same as y. However, if\nx is not the same in essentia as y, it does\nnot follow that x is numerically distinct from\ny. This is because x and y could\noverlap\u2014that is, share at least one part\u2014even if they do\nnot coincide. Thus, Abelard\u2019s answer to the Problem of\nthe Many Men is that while there are many overlapping men, each of\nwhich is different in essentia from the others, this does not\nentail that there are an indefinite number of numerically different\nmen. One might, however, wonder whether Abelard has completely\ndispelled the hint of paradox generated by the initial puzzle. After\nall, it would be nice to know which of these overlapping, but\nnon-coincident wholes is Socrates. All that Abelard\u2019s\ntheoretical tools allow us to do is to say that while there is\nthis whole which is imbued by Socrates\u2019 soul and there\nis that whole which is imbued by Socrates\u2019 soul, these\nwholes are not numerically many and, thus, there are not\nnumerically many men where intuitively we thought there was only one\n(see Normore 2006, 749).\n\nMost medieval philosophers tackle the Problem of the Many Men in\nanother manner. Albert of Saxony, for example, resolves the puzzle by\nclaiming that nothing which is a part of something else can be a\nnumerically distinct existing being (Quaes. in Arist.\nPhysicam I q. 8, 131\u201332; Sophismata 46, 25vb; cf.\nFitzgerald 2009). Socrates\u2019 body less the finger is not a\ndistinct human substance, since it is a part of a human substance,\nnamely, Socrates. Therefore, even if we grant that there are many\nthings present, there are not many distinct\nhumans present where we thought that there was only\nSocrates. If that appears to be an argument by stipulation, the reader\nmight find William of Sherwood\u2019s elaboration on this strategy\nhelpful (Syncategoremata (O\u2019Donnell ed., 61)). William\nconcedes that, because Socrates-less-the-finger is perfected by a\nhuman soul, it can in a certain respect be said to be a human\nbeing. But in this respect Socrates and Socrates-less-the-finger are\nperfected by the same soul and if one wants to count humans,\none counts human souls. Thus, Socrates and Socrates-less-the-finger\nare not numerically distinct humans. On the other hand, if\nSocrates-less-the-finger is considered as a part of something\nlarger that is also perfected by the same soul, then in this respect\nSocrates-less-the-finger is numerically different from Socrates, but\nit is not a human being. Considered in terms of its being a\npart, Socrates-less-the-finger is a part of a body of a human\nbeing, and a body of a human being is not a human. Hence, we count too\nmany humans only if we ignore these different respects under which the\npremises of the argument can be made true.\n",
