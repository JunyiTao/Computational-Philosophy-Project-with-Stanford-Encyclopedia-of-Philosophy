    "main_text": "Life, Works, and General Overview\n1. Life, Works, and General Overview\n\nButler was born in 1692 and attended a dissenting academy where he\nread current philosophy \u2014 including up to date logic, and works\nof John Locke and Samuel Clarke. While a student there Butler wrote a\nletter to Clarke pointing out two problems in Clarke\u2019s arguments\nfor God\u2019s unicity and God\u2019s omnipresence in Demonstration\nof the Being and Attributes of God. Butler\u2019s criticisms led to a\nmutually admiring correspondence. Clarke arranged to have the\ncorrespondence published in 1716, although Butler\u2019s letters\nappeared anonymously. Shortly thereafter Butler joined the Church of\nEngland, attended Oxford, and was ordained. This led to his\nappointment as preacher at Rolls Chapel, the chapel associated with\nthe London equity courts, where he served until 1726. During this\nperiod he also earned a law degree. In 1726 he published a selection\nof his sermons as Fifteen Sermons Preached at the Rolls Chapel. It\nappeared in a second edition in 1729 with corrections and with the\naddition of an important synoptic \u201cPreface.\u201d In 1736\nButler published his major work of natural theology, the Analogy\nof Religion, the work for which he was best known in his\nlifetime, with two brief but important dissertations: \u201cOf\nPersonal Identity\u201d and \u201cOf the Nature of Virtue\u201d\n(hence \u201cDissertation on Virtue\u201d). In the same year he was\nappointed Queen Caroline\u2019s cleric, and after her death the\nfollowing year he rose to become Bishop of Bristol (1738) and\neventually Bishop of Durham (1750). A number of his sermons from the\nlatter part of his career were published individually. Some of them\nwere collected as Six Sermons on Public Occasions and published in\n1749. This was followed by the \u201cDurham Charge\u201d (a work\nexhorting the clergy of his diocese) published a year before\nButler\u2019s death in 1752 (For more on Butler\u2019s life see\nCunliffe 2008, from which most of the above information is derived;\nsee also Cunliffe 1992 and Tennant 2011).\n\nButler\u2019s moral philosophy is characterized by a very high degree\nof analytic rigor and argumentative care. This is all the more\nsurprising for the fact that many of these rigorous arguments are\npresented in sermons (and particularly in footnotes to sermons). The\nmanner in which Butler argues, and the details of the particular\narguments, are indeed what many philosophers who have engaged with him\nhave found most inspiring, even when they have rejected his\nconclusions whole-heartedly. Butler\u2019s first three sermons\nprovide a general framework for his moral philosophy via a\nteleological account of human nature. On the basis of this account of\nhuman nature Butler argues that self-love and benevolence or virtue --\nprinciples that other moral philosophers have seen as in tension\n\u2014 are not only not in tension but mutually supporting when\nproperly understood. The remaining sermons consider a number of key\nfeatures of moral psychology \u2014 self-deception, benevolence,\nforgiveness, compassion \u2014 and further develop the discussions of\nself-love and virtue initiated in the first three sermons. They make\nmanifest that Butler thought that the details of moral psychology when\ncarefully presented and rigorously sorted ruled out many questionable\ncommitments that looser philosophers took them to warrant. These\nparticular moral psychological inquiries are followed by a discussion\nof love of God. For Butler this was a central and unifying sentiment\nthat showed the continuity between morals and natural religion. Butler\nconcluded the Sermons with a discussion of human ignorance, which in\nconjunction with his discussions of self-deceit underscored one of his\ncentral themes: the limits of human self-knowledge and knowledge of\ndivine design, limits that had to be continuously in mind when making\nmoral arguments. Butler\u2019s later sermons, the \u201cDissertation\non Virtue,\u201d and the sections of the Analogy of Religion\nthat concern moral philosophy, also continue to develop many of these\nthemes.\n",
