    "main_text": "Alternative demarcation criteria || Falsificationism\n4.2 Falsificationism\n\nKarl Popper described the demarcation problem as the \u201ckey to\nmost of the fundamental problems in the philosophy of science\u201d\n(Popper 1962, 42). He rejected verifiability as a criterion for a\nscientific theory or hypothesis to be scientific, rather than\npseudoscientific or metaphysical. Instead he proposed as a criterion\nthat the theory be falsifiable, or more precisely that\n\u201cstatements or systems of statements, in order to be ranked as\nscientific, must be capable of conflicting with possible, or\nconceivable observations\u201d (Popper 1962, 39).\n\nPopper presented this proposal as a way to draw the line between\nstatements belonging to the empirical sciences and \u201call other\nstatements \u2013 whether they are of a religious or of a\nmetaphysical character, or simply pseudoscientific\u201d (Popper\n1962, 39; cf. Popper 1974, 981). This was both an alternative to the\nlogical positivists\u2019 verification criteria and a criterion for\ndistinguishing between science and pseudoscience. Although Popper did\nnot emphasize the distinction, these are of course two different\nissues (Bartley 1968). Popper conceded that metaphysical statements\nmay be \u201cfar from meaningless\u201d (1974, 978\u2013979) but\nshowed no such appreciation of pseudoscientific statements.\n\nPopper\u2019s demarcation criterion has been criticized both for\nexcluding legitimate science (Hansson 2006) and for giving some\npseudosciences the status of being scientific (Agassi 1991; Mahner\n2007, 518\u2013519). Strictly speaking, his criterion excludes the\npossibility that there can be a pseudoscientific claim that is\nrefutable. According to Larry Laudan (1983, 121), it \u201chas the\nuntoward consequence of countenancing as \u2018scientific\u2019\nevery crank claim which makes ascertainably false assertions\u201d.\nAstrology, rightly taken by Popper as an unusually clear example of a\npseudoscience, has in fact been tested and thoroughly refuted (Culver\nand Ianna 1988; Carlson 1985). Similarly, the major threats to the\nscientific status of psychoanalysis, another of his major targets, do\nnot come from claims that it is untestable but from claims that it has\nbeen tested and failed the tests.\n\nDefenders of Popper have claimed that this criticism relies on an\nuncharitable interpretation of his ideas. They claim that he should\nnot be interpreted as meaning that falsifiability is a sufficient\ncondition for demarcating science. Some passages seem to suggest that\nhe takes it as only a necessary condition (Feleppa 1990, 142). Other\npassages suggest that for a theory to be scientific, Popper requires\n(in addition to falsifiability) that energetic attempts are made to\nput the theory to test and that negative outcomes of the tests are\naccepted (Cioffi 1985, 14\u201316). A falsification-based demarcation\ncriterion that includes these elements will avoid the most obvious\ncounter-arguments to a criterion based on falsifiability alone.\n\nHowever, in what seems to be his last statement of his position,\nPopper declared that falsifiability is a both necessary and a\nsufficient criterion. \u201cA sentence (or a theory) is\nempirical-scientific if and only if it is falsifiable.\u201d\nFurthermore, he emphasized that the falsifiability referred to here\n\u201conly has to do with the logical structure of sentences and\nclasses of sentences\u201d (Popper [1989] 1994, 82). A (theoretical)\nsentence, he says, is falsifiable if and only if it logically\ncontradicts some (empirical) sentence that describes a logically\npossible event that it would be logically possible to observe (Popper\n[1989] 1994, 83). A statement can be falsifiable in this sense\nalthough it is not in practice possible to falsify it. It would seem\nto follow from this interpretation that a statement\u2019s status as\nscientific or non-scientific does not shift with time. On previous\noccasions he seems to have interpreted falsifiability differently, and\nmaintained that \u201cwhat was a metaphysical idea yesterday can\nbecome a testable scientific theory tomorrow; and this happens\nfrequently\u201d (Popper 1974, 981, cf. 984).\n\nLogical falsifiability is a much weaker criterion than practical\nfalsifiability. However, even logical falsifiability can create\nproblems in practical demarcations. Popper once adopted the view that\nnatural selection is not a proper scientific theory, arguing that it\ncomes close to only saying that \u201csurvivors survive\u201d, which\nis tautological. \u201cDarwinism is not a testable scientific theory,\nbut a metaphysical research program\u201d (Popper 1976, 168). This\nstatement has been criticized by evolutionary scientists who pointed\nout that it misrepresents evolution. The theory of natural selection\nhas given rise to many predictions that have withstood tests both in\nfield studies and in laboratory settings (Ruse 1977; 2000).\n\nIn a lecture in Darwin College in 1977, Popper retracted his previous\nview that the theory of natural selection is tautological. He now\nadmitted that it is a testable theory although \u201cdifficult to\ntest\u201d (Popper 1978, 344). However, in spite of his well-argued\nrecantation, his previous standpoint continues to be propagated in\ndefiance of the accumulating evidence from empirical tests of natural\nselection.\n",
