    "main_text": "Revisionist and Eliminativist Proposals || \n3.4 (below).\n2.4 I-properties and the clutter hypothesis\n\nAs we discussed in Section 1, for more than 150 years there has been\ndisagreement over how to define instinctive (or innate) traits in a\nway that is useful to scientific psychology. Shortly after instinct\nhad become a topic of scientific study, C.L. Morgan (1896) identified\nseven \u201cdefinitional\u201d issues surrounding this term. Two\ndecades later, criticisms by Knight Dunlap (1919) and L.L. Bernard\n(1921) reveal that those ambiguities had not been resolved. It is also\ntelling that Lorenz continued to modify his definition of innateness\nin response to critics over the course of his career, while Tinbergen\neventually abandoned this term altogether. More recently, behavioral\nbiologist Patrick Bateson has observed that, \u201c[a]t least six\nmeanings are attached to the term [innate]: present at birth; a\nbehavioral difference caused by a genetic difference; adapted over the\ncourse of evolution; unchanging throughout development; shared by all\nmembers of a species; and not learned\u201d (1991, 21). His objection\nis not merely that the term \u201cinnate\u201d is ambiguous. Like\nDunlap (1919) and Bernard (1921), his complaint is that ambiguity\npromotes equivocation, encouraging researchers to draw faulty\ninferences as they slide between different senses of innateness. For\nexample, if a trait is deemed \u201cinnate\u201d because there is\nevidence that it is present at birth, psychologists will sometimes\ninfer (without further evidence) that it is therefore\n\u201cinnate\u201d in the sense of being insensitive to\nenvironmental influence. Developmental biologists since Kuo (1921)\nhave provided evidence against this easy inference. Bateson\u2019s\nown work on the phenomenon of parental imprinting in birds (Bateson,\n1966) showed that traits which appear early in life are often highly\nsensitive to specific environmental factors. The tendency for nativism\nto promote such unwarranted inferences has been one of the main\nreasons why many scientists have called for dramatic revision or even\nan elimination of this concept from scientific discourse (see Section\n4.5 of this entry).\n\nPaul Griffiths (2002) has clarified what is ontologically at stake in\nthis objection to nativism. Researchers who draw questionable\ninferences about the properties associated with innateness are\nassuming (implicitly, if not explicitly) that innateness is a natural\nkind. More specifically, they assume that innate traits form what\nRichard Boyd (1989) called a homeostatic property cluster.\nSuch property clusters require the existence of some causal process\nthat \u201cholds together\u201d the relevant properties in a\ncoherent bundle, so to speak. For example, Weismann assumed that the\nonly way for a trait to be modified by natural selection is if it\ndevelops \u201cdirectly\u201d from germline cells. He also assumed\nthat germline cells were the only possible source of developmental\nstability since environmental factors were seen exclusively as a\nsource of developmental noise (Johnston 1995). Thus, on\nWeismann\u2019s picture, the properties of being an adaptation and\nbeing developmentally stable were a part of the same homeostatic\ncluster. It turns out that Weismann\u2019s picture of development was\ntoo narrow. The environment is much more than just a source of noise.\nCertain environmental factors are a source of developmental stability\n(West-Eberhard 2003), acting as a \u201cscaffold\u201d for the\ndevelopment of particular traits (Sterelny 2003). The environment can\nalso store information that organisms rely on during development to\ngenerate adaptive phenotypes (Mameli 2004). So, contra Weismann, there\nis no distinct causal process associated with germline cells that\naccounts for developmental stability and adaptation. Without a known\nprocess to unify the various properties associated with innateness,\nGriffiths (2002) argues, the assumption that they form a homeostatic\ncluster is unwarranted.\n\nThis position was developed in Bateson\u2019s later work with\nphilosopher Matteo Mameli (Mameli and Bateson 2006; 2011; Bateson and\nMameli 2007). Expanding on Bateson\u2019s (1991) original list, they\nidentify a total of twenty-six candidate definitions of innateness in\nthe scientific and philosophical literature (Mameli and Bateson 2006).\nMany of these proposals are deemed unsatisfactory because \u201cthey\nappeal to unclear, unexplained, or controversial notions such as\n\u2018genetic information\u2019, \u2018learning\u2019,\n\u2018developmental induction\u2019, and \u2018normal\ndevelopment\u2019\u201d (2006, 176). Other candidate definitions are\nrejected by Mameli and Bateson because they fail to pick out any trait\nwhatsoever. For instance, no trait is (strictly speaking) genetically\ndetermined or unacquired. Other candidates are rejected because they\napply to all possible traits. For example, every trait is (to some\ndegree) genetically influenced or insensitive to the environment. By\nthe end of their analysis, Mameli and Bateson arrive at a shortlist of\njust eight candidates. These \u201ci-properties\u201d (as they call\nthem) are relatively promising definitions in that they suffer from no\nobvious conceptual or empirical shortcoming. Their shortlist of\ncandidate definitions for \u201cinnate\u201d are as follows:\n\nIt appears reliably at a particular stage of the lifecycle.\nIt develops abnormally in response to environmental manipulations\nwhich were not encountered in the organism\u2019s evolutionary\nhistory.\nIt is not produced by a developmental mechanism that evolved to\ngenerate different phenotypes in response to particular environmental\nconditions (i.e., adaptive phenotypic plasticity), and it is also not\nthe result of exposure to abnormal environmental conditions.\nAny modification to the trait would have a negative impact on the\ndevelopment of other traits (the \u2018generatively\nentrenchment\u2019 of Schank and Wimsatt 1986).\nIt is insensitive to certain environmental changes during\ndevelopment.\nIt is insensitive to certain environmental changes after\ndevelopment.\nThe trait is species typical.\nThe trait is a standard Darwinian adaptation.\n\n\nMameli and Bateson maintain that it is an empirical question whether\nany of these properties cluster together. Moreover, they propose that\nin the absence of a known unifying causal process, we should not\nassume that they do cluster. Mameli (2008) has dubbed this the\n\u201cclutter hypothesis\u201d (in contrast to \u201ccluster\nhypothesis\u201d). Their work has inspired some recent philosophical\ndiscussion over which hypothesis (clutter or cluster) is best\nsupported by available evidence and theory. For instance, Nicholas\nShea (2012) argues that recent developments in evolutionary and\ndevelopmental biology suggest that i-properties do not cluster. In\ncontrast, Muhammad Ali Khalidi (2016) argues that innateness\nproperties do cluster provided that we focus strictly on\npsychology and not biology (assuming that such a distinction can be\ndrawn). This question remains an important area for future\nresearch.\n\nAlthough the clutter hypothesis captures what is ontologically at\nstake in debates over nativism, it does not explain why the associated\nconceptual confusion has been so difficult to resolve. Admittedly,\nambiguities are by no means unknown to science (Cowie 2009; Samuels\n2007). However, the tenacity of nativism debates in psychology seems\nunusual. One might reasonably expect that psychologists would have, by\nnow, disambiguated this concept and developed experimental criteria\nfor detecting specific i-properties. Such questions as whether a trait\nis present at birth, a functional adaptation, developmentally\nsensitive to some environmental factor, and so on should be regarded\nby psychologists as independent research hypotheses (Griffiths 2002).\nOn the contrary, there is a stubborn tendency to conflate these issues\nby simply asking whether some trait is \u201cinnate.\u201d Even\namong researchers who acknowledge on the one hand that\n\u201cinnate\u201d is a multiply ambiguous term will, in other\ncontexts, slide between different i-properties apparently without\nrealizing it (Linquist et al. 2011). Such observations have prompted a\nnumber of recent questionnaire experiments, conducted largely by\nphilosophers, analyzing the \u201cfolk\u201d concept of innateness\nand comparing it to scientific conceptions.\n2.5 Folk essentialism and the psychological attraction of nativism\n\nGriffiths (2002) offered a testable psychological hypothesis to\nexplain the recalcitrance of nativism in psychology and potentially\nother disciplines. The basic idea is that the concept of innateness is\na cornerstone of \u201cfolk biology\u201d (Medin and Atran 1999;\n2004), the pre-theoretical beliefs that people intuitively use to\nunderstand biological systems. Part of folk biology involves the\nclassification of organisms into species-like groupings. These\nclassifications sometimes overlap with scientific classifications, but\noften they diverge. For example, a folk biological classification\nmight identify horses, roses, and octopuses as species-like groupings,\nwhen in fact each of these biological categories contain numerous\nspecies, some of which are morphologically and phylogenetically\ndisparate.\n\nFolk biology also departs from scientific classification in its\nessentialist commitments. Across a wide range of cultures, people tend\nto assume that members of each species possess a common essence or\ncausal nature that determines their appearance, behavior, and\necological roles (Medin and Atran 2004). Psychologists have found that\neven when people have no specific ideas about the nature of a\nparticular species, they nonetheless assume that it must have an\nessence (i.e. they operate with what Medin and Ortony (1989) call an\n\u201cessence placeholder\u201d). It is plausible that folk\nessentialism has served our species well for most of its history.\nMedin and Atran (2004) propose that the existence of an essence\nplaceholder might have motivated people to explore their environments,\nleading them to discover and share information about edible or\nmedicinal plants, about dangerous plants and animals, and other\nsalient aspects of the environment. The idea of an essence might also\nhave assisted humans in tasks associated with agriculture and animal\nhusbandry. Despite its utility, however, essentialism is\nscientifically inaccurate. No internal essence explains why members of\na species share certain traits. Although genetic similarities account\nfor some of the traits that are typical of a species, it is misleading\nto think of a species\u2019 genome as its essence. Elliott Sober\n(1980) provides a detailed account of what is wrong with this idea.\nEssentialism, he notes, employs a Natural State Model of explanation\nwhich views every member of a species as directed toward a single\ndevelopmental outcome (natural state). Essentialists recognize that\nindividuals vary in the characteristics they actually express.\nHowever, such variability is explained according to essentialism by\npositing the effects of intervening forces that interrupt development\nand prevent the full realization of its goal. The reason that\nindividuals of the same sex differ in their sexual preference, on this\nview, is because of slightly different environmental factors impinging\non the development of these individuals. By contrast, on a\nneo-Darwinian model there is no natural state. Individual variability\nis partly explained in terms of genetic variation passed on from one\ngeneration to the next. Moreover, even given a specific genetic\nstarting point, development is not aiming at some specific, natural\nstate, but simply goes wherever local causes push it. The interaction\nbetween genetic and environmental factors is most accurately\nrepresented as a norm of reaction (see Section 3.2 below), where a\nspectrum of developmental outcomes is associated with each unique\ngenotype in a population of genetically variable individuals. This\nneo-Darwinian perspective requires a fairly dramatic shift in\nconventional thinking about species. As Atran et al. (2002, 32) put\nit, \u201cto understand modern biological science, people must\nunlearn universal dispositions to view species\nessentialistically\u201d.\n\nGriffiths (2002) hypothesized that folk essentialism might be exerting\nan influence even on scientists\u2019 and philosophers\u2019\nprofessional judgments about innateness. More precisely, the\nhypothesis states that (1) there is a \u201cfolk\u201d or vernacular\nconcept of innateness that most people operate with in non-technical\ncontexts, (2) this vernacular concept is incompatible with scientific\ndevelopments in such fields as evolutionary and developmental biology,\nand (3) that researchers working in psychology and perhaps other\ndisciplines will employ the vernacular concept of innateness (often\ninadvertently) even when reasoning in a scientific context. Machery et\nal. (2019) have more recently dubbed this the \u201cattractor\nhypothesis\u201d of innateness, because of its similarity to the idea\nof a psychological attractor in cultural evolution (Sperber 1996;\nClaidi\u00e8re and Sperber 2007). An implication of the attractor\nhypothesis of innateness is that the concept of an innate trait will\nbe highly resistant to scientific revision. Despite attempts to refine\nthe concept, researchers will continue to default to the vernacular\nconcept, the theory goes, and draw faulty inferences despite their\nefforts to avoid equivocation. Griffiths (2002) draws the normative\nconclusion that the concept of innateness should be self-consciously\neliminated from scientific discourse. This proposal will be discussed\nbelow (Section 3.5). The remainder of this subsection discusses recent\nexperimental evidence surrounding the attractor hypothesis of\ninnateness.\n\nPhilosophers have devised a number of questionnaire studies exploring\nthe structure of the vernacular concept of innateness (Griffiths, et\nal. 2009; Linquist et al. 2011; Knobe and Samuels 2013) and whether\nthe vernacular concept features in scientists\u2019 judgments about\ninnateness (Knobe and Samuels 2013; Machery et al. 2019). Drawing\nagain from the psychological literature on folk biology, Griffiths et\nal. (2009) identified three features that are thought to be central to\nthe vernacular concept of innateness:\n\nFixity: Innate traits are insensitive to environmental influences\nduring development.\nTypicality: Innate traits are shared by most adult members of the\nsame species or sex.\nFunction: Innate traits serve some purpose or end for the\norganism.\n\n\nThe authors tested this \u201cthree feature theory\u201d (as they\ncall it) using a questionnaire describing examples of birdsong that\ndiffered in Fixity, Typicality, and Function. The aim was to determine\nthe extent to which each factor independently contributes to\nfolk judgments about innateness. This experiment was first conducted\non na\u00efve or non-expert subjects with the aim of first determining\nthe structure of the vernacular concept before examining its potential\nrole in expert (scientific) judgments. As predicted, evidence of\nFixity was enough for na\u00efve subjects to agree that a trait is\ninnate, even if the trait lacks Typicality and Function. Evidence of\nTypicality also independently drove innateness judgments, as did\nFunctionality (though to a lesser degree). The authors take these\nresults to provide a fine-grained analysis of the vernacular concept\nof innateness, revealing just how easily people are prompted to\nclassify a given trait as \u201cinnate.\u201d In a later study,\nLinquist et al. (2011) expanded the survey to test whether Fixity,\nTypicality, and Function also influence naive subjects\u2019\njudgments about whether a trait is \u201cin the DNA.\u201d They\nfound that the two phrases (\u201cinnate\u201d and \u201cin the\nDNA\u201d) draw upon the same underlying folk concept. Linquist et\nal. (2011) also cite examples where researchers in psychology and\nbiology employ the folk concept in drawing unjustified inferences\namong i-properties. It is important to note that although these x-phi\nexperiments are quite limited, their findings are confirmed by a much\nlarger body of experimental work in social psychology on the\n\u2018genetic essentialist framework\u2019 in folk cognition\n(Dar-Nimrod and Heine 2006; 2011; Cheung, et al. 2014). For a side by\nside-comparison of the two models see Stotz and Griffiths (2018).\n\nLinquist and collaborators (2011) predicted that scientists would\ncontinue rely on the vernacular concept of innateness when reasoning\nin a professional context. This prediction was confirmed by Knobe and\nSamuels (2013) who compared na\u00efve subjects\u2019 responses to\nthe same birdsong questionnaire that was developed by Griffiths et al.\n(2009). As the attractor hypothesis predicts, they found that\nscientific training had no effect on a person\u2019s judgments about\ninnateness. Scientists were just as likely as lay people to classify a\ntrait as innate it if exhibits one of Typicality, Fixity or Function.\nThis result went against Knobe and Samuels (2013) own expectations\nthat professional scientists would exhibit a different response\npattern from laypersons. A subsequent analysis of Knobe and\nSamuels\u2019 (2013) data by Machery et al. (2019) took a\nfiner-grained look at how different categories of scientist responded\nto questions about innateness. They found no significant difference\namong psychologists, linguists, and biologists in their responses to\nthe birdsong questionnaire. This finding supports the attractor\nhypothesis and goes against the rival expectation that the concept of\ninnateness functions differently in psychology or linguistics than it\ndoes in biology. Interestingly, however, Knobe and Samuels (2013) also\nasked researchers how \u201cimportant\u201d the concept of\ninnateness is in their discipline. In this case, there was a\nsignificant difference among disciplines, with biologists ranking it\nless important than psychologist or linguists.\n\nOne must be cautious before reading too much significance into these\nresults since the sample size of scientists was fairly small (Machery\net al. 2019), the questionnaire offered only a limited glimpse into\nthe folk concept of innateness (Samuels 2016), and the questions\npresented (on birdsong) might have been more familiar to certain\ndisciplines (e.g. to biologists) than they were to others. This topic\nis ripe for future research. That said, a few additional results\nreported by Knobe and Samuels (2013) are worth mentioning.\n\nIn one of their experiments the authors manipulated the way in which\nbirdsong was described. In one condition, birds were described as\n\u201clearning\u201d their song. In another condition, the same\nacquisition process was described in neurological terms: birds were\ndescribed not as learning their songs, but rather as acquiring songs\nthrough specific neurological interactions with the environment.\nRecall that primitivism (Section 2.3) predicts that a trait described\nas \u201cunlearned\u201d should be less likely to be seen as innate\nthan one which is described as the result of a sub-personal,\nneurological process. The fact that subjects responded no differently\nto the \u201clearned\u201d versus \u201cneurological\u201d\nversions of the questionnaire (regardless of whether they were\nscientists or lay persons) contradicts this prediction of primitivism.\nIt is also interesting to note that Knobe and Samuels (2013) found an\neffect of moral \u201cvalence\u201d on innateness judgments. If a\nbehavior was morally unacceptable, subjects were less likely to judge\nit as innate than if it was morally good. This result ties in with a\nbroader literature on the influence of moral valence on all manner of\nfolk judgments (Knobe and Mendlow 2004; Cushman, et al. 2008; Petit\nand Knobe 2009). Finally, Knobe and Samuels (2013) included another\nversion of the birdsong questionnaire in which subjects were told how\ndifferent vignettes varied from one another, while also prompting\nsubjects to justify their responses. This was interpreted by the\nauthors as a \u201creflective\u201d condition, with the aim of\nprompting subjects to answer more systematically. Knobe and Samuels\n(2013) report that subjects responded more systematically under the\n\u201creflective\u201d condition than they did under the\nunreflective one, suggesting that even na\u00efve subjects will be\nless likely to equivocate in their judgments if they are prompted to\ndo so (see Linquist 2018 for a discussion of this result). All of the\nexperiments reported in this section are suggestive and offer an\ninteresting example of how empirical methods can be used to analyze\nboth folk and scientific concepts. Hopefully other researchers will be\ninspired to carry this work forward.\n3. Revisionist and Eliminativist Proposals\n\nPhilosophers have suggested three ways to avoid future iterations of\nthe nature versus nurture debate. First, revisionist proposals aim to\nrestrict the definition of \u201cinnate\u201d to a subset of the\ni-properties outlined by Mameli and Bateson (see Section 2.4).\u00a0\nPerhaps if scientists converge on a single meaning, problems\nassociated with equivocation will decrease, and psychology generally\nwill undergo conceptual progress. Second, eliminativist proposals\nargue that while conceptual revision sounds like a nice idea it is\nunlikely to succeed. A more practical approach, eliminitivists\nsuggest, is to discard innatness as a serious scientific construct. A\nthird strategy, outlined by Cowie (2009) is to do nothing. Vagueness\naround the innate acquired distinction has caused, on her view, no\ninhibition to scientific progress. In this section we review some\nrecent revisionist proposals, attempts to establish a single, clear\ndefinition. Eliminativism and the \u201cdo nothing\u201d proposals\nare considered in Section 3.5.\n3.1 Innateness as genetic specification\n\nAccording to our intuitive or \u201cfolk\u201d conception of\ninnateness, a trait qualifies as innate if it is either typical of\nmost members of the species, or if it is developmentally buffered\nagainst certain environmental factors, or if it is an evolutionary\nadaptation (Griffiths, et al. 2009). It might be argued that all three\nof these properties are coextensive with traits that are genetically\nspecified: 1. Species-typicality is explained, on this view, by the\nfact that members of each species share a common pool of genes. 2.\nSome genes are developmentally buffered against certain environmental\nfactors, such that within some range of variation those factors do not\nimpact the expression of those genes. 3. Finally, many biologists see\nthe gradual accumulation of genetic mutations as the primary mechanism\nallowing phenotypes to undergo evolutionary adaptation. Putting these\nideas together, it might seem plausible to cash out the folk\nconception of innateness in terms of genetic information. More\nprecisely, a trait could be described as more or less innate depending\non the extent to which its development is guided by genetic\ninformation. One potential advantage of this analysis is that it can\nmake sense of the dispositional nature of certain \u201cinnate\u201d\ntraits. Many traits have a late developmental onset, such as those\nassociated with puberty in humans. Their developmental fixity, their\nspecies typicality, and their functionality can lead people to judge\nthese traits as \u201cinnate\u201d despite not being present early\nin life. This judgment makes sense if innate traits are those which\nare genetically specified, since the genetic predisposition to develop\ncertain characters is present in the organism from conception.\n\nDespite these apparent advantages, most philosophers reject this\nproposal. As Elliott Sober (1988; 2000) points out, when speaking\nabout a particular trait in a particular organism \u2013 such as the\nreader\u2019s own height \u2013 it makes no sense to ask how much of\nthat individual trait was determined by genes and how much by the\nenvironment. All traits require both genetic and environmental factors\nfor their development. Thus, one cannot isolate these causal factors\nin a way that would allow for the comparison of their relative\nphenotypic contributions. We cannot ask, for example, how an organism\nwould develop in an \u201cenvironmental vacuum\u201d because it\nwould not develop at all. Sober further notes that genetic and\nenvironmental contributions are incommensurable. If you are six feet\ntall, we cannot sensibly ask how much of your height came from your\ngenes and how much came from your environment. There are no\n\u201cheight particles\u201d produced by both genes and environments\nthat add up to determine your height (Sober 1988). Genes and\nenvironment both make contributions, but not contributions that can be\ntaken apart and then weighed separately. Yet the folk concept of\ninnateness clearly applies to particular traits in particular\nindividuals: Donald Trump\u2019s eyes are innately grey-blue but his\nskin is not innately orange. Such statements cannot be meaningfully\ntranslated into statements about the relative contributions of genes\nend environment to Trump\u2019s eyes or Trump\u2019s skin.\n\nThe scientific discipline that does meaningfully address questions of\nthe relative contributions of genes and environment is quantitative\ngenetics. It does so by shifting its focus from the individual to the\npopulation. Instead of investigating individuals, quantitative\ngeneticists focus on populations comprised of genetically\nvariable individuals. Instead of asking how genetic and environmental\nfactors influence the development of an individual, this discipline\nfocuses on how each factor influences phenotypic differences\nin a population. It is important to understand how this focus on\npopulation-level phenotypic differences impacts judgments about\nwhether a given trait is \u201cgenetic.\u201d An obvious limitation\nof this approach is that it can be applied only to traits that exhibit\nphenotypic variation. Take some trait that is invariant, such as all\nhumans having one head. Without variation in this trait, it is not\npossible to conduct a population-level analysis to determine the\nextent to which this trait is genetically encoded. There are no\nphenotypic differences at the population level, and so no\ndistinguishable genetic contribution to those differences (see\n SEP entry\n on heritability). This is, again, at odds with our vernacular notion\nof innateness, which would surely judge the human head to be an innate\ntrait. Indeed, typicality (or invariance) is one of the driving\nfactors in folk judgments of innateness (Griffiths, et al. 2009), so\nthe conventional scientific method for evaluating genetic\ncontributions to trait development is at odds with our folk intuitions\nfor this reason alone.\n\nAnother implication of this approach is that judgments about the\nmagnitudes of genetic vs environmental contributions are relative to a\nspecific population and to a particular environment. Changing either\none of these contextual factors can alter the extent to which some\ntrait is deemed genetic. For example, suppose that a quantitative\ngeneticist is interested in growing large corn plants. She sets out to\ncompare two different corn genotypes (G1 and G2) across two different\nfertilizer treatments (E1 and E2). Suppose that G2 grows larger than\nG1 by exactly 5 units in both E1 and E2. This would lead our\nresearcher to conclude that the observed variation in corn height is\ndue entirely to genetic differences. We might further infer that the\ntrait of height in corn plants is more strongly influenced by genetic\nthan by environmental factors. However, this judgment is contingent on\nthe comparison class that our researcher has chosen. Imagine another\nscenario in which G2 is compared to yet another genotype (G3). This\ntime, our researcher compares E2 to E3, a third fertilizer treatment\ndistinct from E1. Further suppose that G2 and G3 grow to the same\nheight in E2, but that G3 is five units larger than G2 in E3. In this\ncase, a comparison based on population differences suggests that the\nfocal trait is more strongly influenced by environmental than by\ngenetic factors. Let us now focus just on G2 in E2, and ask whether\nheight in these corn plants is more strongly influenced by genetic or\nenvironmental factors? Sober (1988) uses a similar example to\nillustrate that any answer to this question is contingent on the\ncomparison class one chooses. If we compare G2/E2 to G1/E1, then\nheight differences come out as genetically influenced; but if we\ncompare G2/E2 to G3/E3, then height differences come out as\nenvironmentally influenced. Hence, judgments about the relative\nmagnitudes of genetic versus environmental contributions are\ninherently \u201cnon-local\u201d or context sensitive.\n\nSome philosophers take this as sufficient grounds for rejecting any\nanalysis of innateness in terms of genetic contributions (e.g. Khalidi\n2007). The worry is that there is no canonical comparison class for\nevaluating the relative contributions of genetic and environmental\ninfluences. Different researchers will select different alleles and\ndifferent environments for investigating a given trait and there is no\nnon-arbitrary way to determine which is the \u201ccorrect\u201d\ncomparison class. Insofar as innateness is not a context sensitive\nconcept, but the magnitude of genetic contribution is highly context\nsensitive, innateness cannot be defined as magnitude of genetic\ncontribution. One way to potentially avoid this implication is by\nspecifying a canonical or \u201cnormal\u201d range of environments.\nIn this view, a trait is relatively innate to the extent that genetic\n(as opposed to environmental) factors explain phenotypic differences\nacross the normal range of environments. This proposal will be\nconsidered more carefully in the following section (Section 3.2)\nInterested readers might refer to entries on\n Gene\n and\n Biological Information).\n\nAnother way to potentially avoid the context-sensitivity objection is\nto develop some other method of quantifying genetic vs environmental\ncontributions to phenotypes. We saw earlier (Section 1) that Lorenz\nattempted to define innate traits in terms of the extent to which they\nare encoded by genetic information. This proposal places\nemphasis on the concept of information and whether it is possible to\ncompare traits according to the relative amounts to which they are\nstructured by genetic information. A general problem with this\napproach is that genes do not contain information about traits,\nstrictly speaking. As Peter Godfrey-Smith has noted, \u2018All the\ngenes can code for, if they code for anything, is the primary\nstructure (amino acid sequence) of a protein\u2019 (Godfrey-Smith\n1999, 328). Considered as a language, the genetic code can only refer\nto the twenty-three standard amino acids and can only say which order\nto put them in. The only exceptions to this are the\n\u2018start\u2019 and \u2018stop\u2019 codons which affect where\nDNA transcription begins and ends. Many other things happen as a\ndownstream causal consequence of the order of amino acids, but to\nparaphrase Godfrey Smith\u2019s argument, genes do not \u2018code\nfor\u2019 these downstream causal consequences for the same reason\nthat President Nixon\u2019s order to cover up the Watergate scandal\nwas not an \u2018order\u2019 to get himself impeached by Congress.\n\u2018Coding for\u2019, like \u2018ordering\u2019 and other\nsemantic locutions, is not merely another name for\n\u2018causing\u2019. The idea that the \u2018genetic program\u2019\nor \u2018genetic instructions\u2019 for phenotypes are literally\nwritten in the genetic code is a continuing barrier to the public\nunderstanding of genetics, one that is reinforced every time a\njournalist reports that scientists have \u2018decoded\u2019 the gene\nfor something. In reality there are no tiny \u2018traitunculi\u2019\nhidden in the genome awaiting a sufficiently powerful genetic\nmicroscope to read them (Schaffner 1998, 2016).\n\nBut although the sequences of nucleotides in the genome do not\nliterally \u2018code for\u2019 phenotypic traits, they are, of\ncourse, amongst the causes of phenotypic traits. Several philosophers\nand scientists have introduced technical definitions of \u2018genetic\ninformation\u2019 based on these causal relationships in order to\nexplicate the intuitive idea that genes carry information about\nphenotypes. These proposals are discussed in more detail in the entry\n Biological information.\n Here we will simply make two points about these proposals. The first\npoint is that there are some very straightforward senses in which\ngenes \u2018carry information\u2019 about phenotypes. The human Y\nchromosome carries information about sex in the same way that\n\u2018smoke means fire\u2019: one can be predicted from the other.\nIn addition, the SRY region on the Y-chromosome is an adaptation for\nmaking organisms into males, so we can apply a version of\n\u2018teleosemantics\u2019, an approach which defines information in\nterms of adaptation, to this piece of DNA (Sterelny, et al. 1996; Shea\n2007 and see the entry on\n Teleological Theories of Mental Content).\n The second point is that these straightforward senses of\n\u2018information\u2019 also seem to be applicable to environmental\ncauses in development (Oyama 1985; Griffiths and Gray 2005). Mammals\nhave a chromosomal system of sex-determination. But many reptiles use\ntemperature, an environmental signal, to switch genetically identical\neggs between male or female developmental pathways. Other reptiles\nhave a genetic system which can be overridden by an environmental\nsignal. Some fish even switch sex in adulthood in response to\nenvironmental cues. These environmental signals carry information\nabout sex in the same unproblematic \u2018smoke means fire\u2019\nsense as the SRY gene. Moreover, the behaviors that parents use to\ngive appropriate cues to their eggs, and some of the products of those\nbehaviors, such as nests of rotting vegetation which maintain a\nsuitable temperature range, are designed by natural selection to\nensure the correct sex-ratio in offspring, so the teleosemantic\nprogram can be applied to them too. The idea that genes \u2018carry\ninformation\u2019 about phenotypes in a special sense which\ndistinguishes them from other causes is not the piece of common-sense\nit is often taken to be, but rather a highly contested idea that is\nthe focus of much work in the philosophy of biology. See the entry on\n Biological Information.\n3.2 Developmental invariance and the norm of reaction\n\nThe previous section touched on the fact that judgments about the\nrelative contributions of genetic vs environmental factors to trait\ndifferences are context sensitive. They are sensitive to both the\nallelic combinations that a researcher studies and also to range of\nenvironments that a researcher includes in her analysis. Quantitative\ngeneticists recognize that a given genetic variant (allele) will have\nvariable phenotypic effects across different environments. These\nresponses are often nonlinear, such that gradual increases in an\nenvironmental parameter do not have correspondingly gradual phenotypic\neffects. At the same time, different genetic variants (alleles)\ncompared against a single environment will often produce a range of\nphenotypic effects. Quantitative geneticists typically represent these\ninteractions with a graphical tool called the norm of reaction. These\ndiagrams were introduced at around the same time as the idea of the\ngene and the distinction between genotype and phenotype (Sarkar 1999)\nand have long been advocated as the clearest way to think about the\nrole of genes in development (Hogben 1933; Lewontin 1974; Gottlieb\n1995; Kitcher 2001). Suppose, for example, that with respect to some\nenvironmental variable (E) an organism with a given genotype (G1) will\ndevelop the same phenotype (P) way no matter what value the\nenvironmental variable takes (Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. A norm of reaction in which\nthe phenotype P is \u2018genetically determined\u2019\n\n\nIf a norm of reaction has this shape, we can say that P is\n\u2018genetically determined\u2019 even though it has an\nenvironmental factor as one of its causes. Philip Kitcher suggests\nthat some norms of reaction may have this form, but only in some\nlimited, but perhaps contextually important, range of environments\n(Kitcher 2001). For example, a disease caused by the loss of one or\nboth normal copies of a gene might develop in every\nenvironment except those specifically structured as clinical\ninterventions to cure the disease.\n\nAnother norm of reaction is one in which genetic and environmental\nfactors interact \u2018additively\u2019 (Figure 2). Genotype makes a\nconstant difference across some range of environments. While\nthe genetic variable does not determine the actual value of the trait\nin each individual, it does determine the differences between\nindividuals. Moreover, when the norms of reaction have this form,\nheritability scores become relevant to the question of whether and how\nmuch a phenotype can be altered by environmental intervention, as\ndiscussed in the previous section. A famous diagram in the early days\nof behavior genetics depicted the relationship between IQ (P),\ngenotype (G) and the \u2018enrichment\u2019 of the environment (E)\nas having roughly this form (Gottesman 1963a). If correct, this would\nmean that educational enrichment would cause every individual to get a\nhigher test score, but would not change the ordering of their\nscores.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Purely additive interaction\nbetween genotype and environment\n\n\nIn perhaps the most famous paper on this topic the geneticist Richard\nLewontin (1974) argued that actual norms of reaction are likely to be\nnon-additive (Figure 3). In that case, it makes no sense to talk of a\nparticular genotype \u2018determining\u2019 a phenotypic difference.\nGenotype and environment jointly determine the outcome in the\nstraightforward sense that the effect of each factor on the outcome is\na function of the particular value taken by the other factor. Whether\nnorms of reaction are typically non-additive and exactly what this\nimplies is the subject of an extensive scientific and philosophical\nliterature on \u2018gene-environment interaction\u2019, as discussed\nin the previous section.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Non-additive interaction\nbetween genotype and environment\n\n\nKitcher (2001) argues that \u2018genetic determinism\u2019 should be\nunderstood as the claim that many norms of reaction have roughly the\n\u2018determinist\u2019 shapes depicted in Figures 1 and 2.\n\nIn recent philosophical literature on innateness, Sober (1998) is\noften credited with the proposal that innateness might be defined as a\nflat norm of reaction (but see Cassidy (1979) for an earlier\nexposition of this idea). According to Sober:\n\n\u2026it is a reasonable hypothesis that the most that can be\nsalvaged from the ancient concept of innateness is this: a\nphenotypic trait is innate for a given genotype if and only if that\nphenotype will emerge in all of a range of developmental\nenvironments. What counts as the appropriate range of\nenvironments is left open in this proposal. Perhaps there is a\nuniquely correct answer to this question; then again, maybe the range\nis determined pragmatically. It is difficult to see how the latter\nconclusion can be evaded. (1998, author\u2019s emphasis)\n\n\nSo if the \u2018ancient\u2019 concept of innateness is to be\nsalvaged in this way, the problem of context sensitivity looms large.\nAny given trait is bound to develop in some environmental contexts and\nbe absent in others. Sober\u2019s hope is that this issue can be\nsolved \u201cpragmatically\u201d. This is reminiscent of\nSamuels\u2019 (2002) suggestion that the question of what counts as a\n\u201cnormal\u201d environment should be left to scientists and is\nnot something for philosophers to resolve. Of course, this agnostic\nattitude does not make the problem go away. The fact remains that\nanyone proposing to define innateness in terms of developmental\nstability will have to justify their choice of relevant environments.\nThe fact that scientists can and do manage to perform quantitative\ngenetic analyses does not allay the concern that their choice of which\nenvironmental conditions to consider may be arbitrary or\ninappropriate.\n\nIn his seminal paper \u2018The idea of innateness\u2019 (1975)\nStephen Stich made a similar suggestion, that an innate trait might be\ndefined as one which an organism will manifest in the\n\u201cnormal\u201d course of development. But Stich himself offered\na counterexample to this analysis: universally held beliefs, such as\nthe belief that water quenches thirst, will count as innate on this\nanalysis, which seems counterintuitive (Stich 1975, 9). Andr\u00e9\nAriew has offered another counterexample: humans acquire a typical gut\nflora during development, but these bacteria are intuitively an\nacquired trait rather than an innate trait (Ariew 1999, 133). Ariew\nsuggests that Stich\u2019s analysis confuses evidence for innateness\nwith innateness itself. Universality is evidence for the existence of\na particular kind of developmental mechanism which Ariew explicates in\nterms of Waddington\u2019s concept of environmental canalization\n(Ariew 2007, 10, and see Section 3.4 below).\n\nKhalidi (2002) identifies a further objection to the proposal that\ninnateness can be defined as invariance across some\n\u201cnormal\u201d range of environments. Sometimes, he notes, the\nstrongest evidenced that a trait is innate is its capacity to develop\nin highly abnormal conditions. Consider the deprivation\nexperiments deployed by early ethologists, where animals were raised\nin social isolation or other impoverished circumstances. The tendency\nfor a trait to develop even under these (abnormal) conditions was\nregarded as strong evidence of its innateness. From this perspective\nit seems utterly wrong-headed to define innateness in terms of some\nnormal range, so long as \u201cnormal\u201d is defined as the\nenvironments which a species typically encounters.\n\nCowie (1998) pushes on this idea from another direction. Drawing on\nSocrates\u2019 famous interaction with the slave boy in Plato\u2019s\nMeno, Cowie notes that the boy\u2019s knowledge of geometry is\nregarded as innate simply because it developed in an (arguably)\ninformationally impoverished environment. It makes no difference\nwhether the slave boy\u2019s interaction with Socrates qualifies as a\nnormal environment or not. Hence, environmental invariance is not\nconnected, she argues, to intuitive judgments of innateness (see\nKhalidi 2002 for a discussion of this argument).\n3.3 Innateness as environmental canalization\n\nAndr\u00e9 Ariew (1996; 1999; 2007) has developed a more specific\nversion of the environmental invariance account of innateness.\nFollowing Stich (1975) and Sober (1988), Ariew maintains that the\nprimary job for the concept of innateness \u2013 not just in\npsychology, but in the life sciences generally \u2013 is to explain\nenvironmental invariance. The problem with the norm of reaction\naccount, Ariew objects, is that it merely redescribes this pattern\nrather than explaining the processes that generate it. In an effort to\nexplain invariance, Ariew invokes C. H. Waddington\u2019s idea of\nenvironmental canalization. An environmentally canalized trait is\nbuffered against certain types and amounts of environmental variation\nover stages of its development. Waddington described this phenomenon\nusing the metaphor of an \u201cepigenetic landscape\u201d which\nconsists of a ball rolling down a contoured surface (Figure 4). The\nsurface is sloped like a pinball machine. The path traced by a ball as\nit rolls through a particular valley represents the trajectory of a\ndeveloping trait. The amount of \u201cshaking\u201d required to make\nthe ball jump out of one valley and into another depends on the\noverall shape of the landscape. The deeper (more canalized) the\nvalley, the more buffered the trait is against environmental changes\n(or genetic changes, but Ariew focuses on environmental canalization\nrather than its complement, genetic canalization). His proposal is\nsimply that a trait should be considered innate to the extent that it\nis environmentally canalized in Waddington\u2019s sense. One\nadvantage of this definition, he adds, is that it represents\ninnateness as a matter of degree rather than as an all-or-nothing\nproperty.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Waddington\u2019s\ndevelopmental landscape (A). Figure B shows the underside of the\nlandscape with points on the surface anchored to loci in the genome,\nrepresenting the idea that genetic mutations will affect the shape of\nthe landscape. (Waddington 1957, 29 & 36, reproduced with\npermission)\n\n\nNotice that Ariew\u2019s proposal hinges on a particular view of\nWaddington\u2019s metaphor and its cognitive status. Ariew takes this\nmetaphor to provide a mechanistic explanation of developmental\ninvariance. This is the purported benefit of Ariew\u2019s\ncanalization account over the invariance proposal. As he explains,\n\u201cIt is this sense of [environmental] canalization that accounts\nfor the invariance effect that is central to Sober\u2019s account of\nbiological innateness. But better than a mere invariance account, the\neffect is grounded in a real developmental pathway\u201d (Ariew 2007,\n579). Linquist (2018) raises doubts about this claim. When we think\ncarefully about Waddington\u2019s landscape metaphor, he argues, it\nis difficult to see how it could be regarded as an actual causal\nmechanism or even an idealized a model of a mechanism. Instead, most\nmolecular biologists view canalization as a phenomenon to be explained\nrather than as a mechanism that does any explaining. As Greg Gibson\nand G\u00fcnter Wagner note, \u201cThere are likely to be many\nmolecular mechanisms involved [in canalization], including genetic\nredundancy, feedback regulation, and cooperative biochemical\ninteractions\u201d (2000, 373\u201374). They go on to state that\n\u201c[t]hese are more phenomenological descriptions, however, than\nquantitative explanations of buffering.\u201d If these more specific\nproposals are regarded by developmental biologists as \u201cmerely\nphenomenological descriptions\u201d and thus fall short of explaining\ncanalization, where does this leave Waddington\u2019s broader and\nless specific landscape metaphor? Linquist\u2019s (2018) contention\nis that any explanatory insight provided by Waddington\u2019s\nmetaphor is merely apparent. Much like the norm of reaction, this\nmetaphor merely describes the phenomenon of environmental invariance\nwithout explaining it.\n\nAriew (2007) has proposed a second, very different way in which\ncanalization might offer an advantage over the invariance account.\nAriew suggests that the concept of canalization provides a framework\nfor comparing species in their sensitivity to environmental factors.\nFor example, Sober 1998 introduces three different types of learning\nexhibited by different species of songbird. Type 1 songbirds produce\nspecies-typical song even if the bird is reared in silence. Type 2\nbirds produce species-typical song only after sessions of call and\nresponse with a \u201ctutor\u201d from their own species. Type 3\nsongbirds produce their species-typical song after encountering any\nsong at all. These cases are presented by Ariew (2007) as if they vary\nalong a continuum of sensitivity to environmental cues. Type 1\nlearning seems the least sensitive. Type 3 learning is only slightly\nmore sensitive that Type 1, since the trait is \u201ctriggered\u201d\nby exposure to a wide range of songs. Type 2 learning is the most\nsensitive to the specific songs that a bird encounters. Hence,\nAriew\u2019s suggestion is that Type 1 is \u201cmore innate\u201d\nthan Type 3, which is in turn \u201cmore innate\u201d than Type 2.\nBy suggesting that birdsong can be organized along a single axis of\ninnate/triggered/acquired, Ariew seems to be proposing a form of\nexplanatory unification in the sense developed by Kitcher (1989) (see\nthe entry on\n Scientific Explanation).\n An important feature of explanatory unification is the capacity to\nshow how disparate phenomena, previously thought to be unrelated, can\nbe derived using a single, limited vocabulary for describing them. We\ncan apply this to Ariew\u2019s birdsong example. Upon first\nencountering the three types of learning (Types 1, 2, and 3), one\nmight assume that they are entirely distinct phenomena. However, to\nfurther discover that they vary along a single parameter \u2013 i.e.,\nthe \u201cinnateness/triggering/acquired\u201d dimension \u2013\nwould seem to unify them, in Kitcher\u2019s sense.\n\nIn response to Ariew\u2019s proposal, however, Griffiths and Machery\n(2008) argue that canalization is actually a multi-dimensional\nphenomenon. There is no such thing as \u201cthe\u201d degree to\nwhich a trait is buffered against \u201cthe\u201d environment.\nRather, for each trait there are many different environmental factors\ncapable of influencing its development, each to varying degrees.\nAriew\u2019s example with the songbirds seems to work only because it\nis oversimplified. With examples of real birds it proves unworkable.\nFor example, the songs of the much-studied Brown-headed Cowbird are\nrelatively insensitive to the songs of other male cowbirds. This is in\ncontrast to the equally well-studied Song Sparrow, whose songs are\nhighly sensitive to conspecific male songs. So, when we focus on just\nthis factor \u2013 male conspecific song \u2013 the cowbirds seem\nrelatively canalized or \u201cinnate\u201d compared to the sparrows.\nHowever, other researchers focus on the ways that courtship\ninteractions (with females) influence song development. When it comes\nto this environmental factor, the song of male cowbirds is much more\nsensitive (less canalized) than most sparrows. Hence, song development\nwill appear more or less canalized or \u201cinnate\u201d in these\ntaxa depending on which environmental factor we focus. Hence,\nGriffiths and Machery conclude:\n\nThe strategy of placing traits along a continuum of independence of\nthe environment founders on the fact that there is no continuum, but\nrather a high-dimensional space whose axes are often specific to one\nor a few species. Even when the same axes can be applied to different\nspecies, so that canalization of a character in two species can be\nmeaningfully compared, there is no systematic tendency for traits that\nare at the \u201cinnate\u201d end of one axis to be at the\n\u201cinnate\u201d end of the other. (2008, 402)\n\n\nThis situation threatens Ariew\u2019s suggestion that canalization\nmight serve as a unifying concept in biology and psychology. In order\nto effectively unify disparate phenomena, such as the development of\nsong in different species of birds, a concept must provide some\nrelatively simple organizing framework. Ariew painted a simplistic\npicture of birdsong, giving the impression that different species\ncould be arranged along a single environmental axis. Griffiths and\nMachery object that there are indefinitely many environmental axes\nalong which a group of species might be compared. Moreover, the\narrangement of species as more or less canalized will vary from one\nenvironmental axis to the next. Such complexity and lack of coherence\nmakes canalization a bad candidate for conceptual unification.\n\nGriffiths and Machery (2008) mention another consideration that makes\nthe prospects for conceptual unification seem even less promising.\nThey note that the kinds of environmental factors that influence trait\ndevelopment are often highly surprising. For instance, there is a link\nbetween maternal licking of male rat pups and their ability to perform\nsexually as adults (Moore 1992). From these examples, one gets the\nimpression that cryptic environmental influences abound and that the\nonly obstacle to their discovery is researchers\u2019 ability to\nanticipate them. However, if researchers are often unaware of which\nenvironmental factors influence a trait, they then are unlikely to\ntest for those factors experimentally. This means that traits will be\ndeemed \u201cinnate\u201d or environmentally canalized, not because\nthey are buffered against many environmental factors, but rather\nbecause researchers have not thought to look at the factors to which\nthey are sensitive.\n\nOne way to potentially render scientific statements more accurate is\nby demanding that any innateness claim is explicit about the precise\nenvironmental contexts being taken into account. Elizabeth\nO\u2019Neil (2014) proposes this as a strategy for revising the\nscientific concept of innateness. She proposes that scientists\nstudying innateness should always explicitly identify the\nenvironmental contexts in which a given trait is (or is not)\ndevelopmentally invariant. O\u2019Neill argues that such a shift in\nscientific discourse would reduce the amount of confusion produced by\ninnateness claims. However, even if this new scientific convention\ncould be established, what further benefit would there be in adding\nthe term \u2018innate\u2019 after specifying the actual dimensions\nand degrees of environmental canalization? Scientists could simply\nfollow Bateson\u2019s call to: \u201cSay what you mean (even if it\nuses a bit more space) rather than unintentionally confuse your\nreaders by employing a word such as innate that carries so many\ndifferent connotations\u201d (Bateson 1991, 22).\n3.4 Other revisionary proposals\n\nWe have described three revisionary proposals in detail because they\nreflect major themes in the century long controversy about the innate\nacquired distinction. But there are many other proposals to redefine\ninnateness in the philosophical literature.\n\nRon Mallon and Jonathan Weinberg (2006, 2008) argue that an innate\nphenotype is \u201cproperly understood\u201d (2008, 415) as one that\nis invariant in normal environments (Section 3.2), but also produced\nby a \u2018closed developmental process.\u2019 Mallon and\nWeinberg\u2019s distinction between \u2018open\u2019 and\n\u2018closed\u2019 processes appears to be the same as that that\ndrawn by Ernst Mayr (1961) between open and closed genetic programs.\nAn open developmental process can respond to different environments by\nproducing a range of different phenotypes, while a closed\ndevelopmental process can only produce one or a small number of\noutcomes and changing the environment either has no effect or simply\nterminates the process, perhaps killing or severely impairing the\norganism.\n\nGualtiero Piccinini and Robert Northcott propose that \u201ctraits\nare innate to the degree that they are caused by factors intrinsic to\nthe organism at the time of its origin\u201d (2018, 1). This is the\ncorrect definition of innateness and judgments that disagree with it\nshould be revised, although they suggest that only those\n\u201cuntutored\u201d in biology will make such divergent judgments\n(2018, 1). Their proposal relies on three key ideas, intrinsic\nfactors, the organism\u2019s moment of origin, and degree of causal\nexplanation. The idea of intrinsic factors is meant as a superior\nalternative to the idea that innate phenotypes depend on genes or on\ninherited factors. Those two ideas are replaced by the idea of\n\u201cproperties that organisms have in virtue of what\u2019s within\ntheir boundaries\u201d (2018, 2).\u00a0 Some of these intrinsic\nfactors are present at the moment when an organism becomes a new\nindividual (which they note may not be well-defined for all\norganisms). The degree to which these factors explain a phenotype is\nto be measured using Northcott\u2019s (2013) theory of degrees of\ncausal explanation.\n\nNathan Cofnas (2017) has attempted to revive Lorenz\u2019s 1965\ntheory\u00a0 (See Section 1.4). Lorenz was basically correct that\ninnate phenotypes are those which are adaptive because of information\ncontained in the genome, although the details of Lorenz\u2019s theory\nneed revision in light of recent work on epigenetic and cultural\nevolution. Cofnas\u2019s main addition to Lorenz is to propose that\ngenes contain adaptive information in the\n \u2018teleosemantic\u2019\n sense that they have evolved by natural selection to create a\nparticular adaptive match between phenotype and environment.\n\nMuhammad Ali Khalidi (2002; 2007; 2016) has developed an account of\ninnateness that builds on the older idea of \u2018poverty of the\nstimulus\u2019 (Section 1.5). He restricts his account to\npsychological traits, where the problems of assessing the relative\nweight of genetic and environmental causes can be avoided, \u201cby\nfocusing on the informational content of the stimulus relative to the\nresultant cognitive capacity\u201d (2002, 263). In Khalidi\u2019s\nview, it is possible to judge the informational complexity of certain\nrepresentational states, such as a belief or cognitive skill. It is\nalso possible, according to Khalidi, to assess the amount of\nenvironmental information available to the organism during\ndevelopment. The discrepancy between the amount of available\ninformation and the complexity of the belief or skill determines its\ndegree of innateness. A complex belief that develops in an\ninformationally impoverished environment is highly innate on this\nview. Such beliefs are sometimes described as being\n\u201ctriggered\u201d by the environment, as opposed to being\nlearned (Fodor 1981). Hence, Khalidi dubs this the\n\u2018triggering\u2019 account of innateness: \u201cAn innate\ncognitive capacity is one that has a disposition or tendency to be\ntriggered on the basis of an environmental input that is impoverished\nby comparison to the resultant cognitive capacity\u201d (Khalidi\n2009, 506). Because of its limited range of application this is not\nintended as a general\u00a0 definition of innateness. Rather, the\ntriggering account is intended as an explication of how cognitive\nscientists currently use the term.\n\nIt should be clear that the success of this account depends on our\nability to make sense of this notion of informational relevance.\nKhalidi admits that a quantitative measure is difficult, but argues\nthat there are robust non-quantitative ways to document the\ninformational poverty of the environment relative to the phenotype\n(Khalidi 2007).\n\nA consistent theme in recent revisionist proposals is the\nauthors\u2019 conviction that they have correctly diagnosed how\nworking scientists understand innateness. Cofnas, for example,\nsuggests that it is primarily philosophers who have criticised the\nidea of innateness and that amongst real scientists only \u201ca few\nphilosophically minded ones\u201d have any reservations about the\nconcept. To nearly all scientists it is \u201ca valid, useful concept\nwith an obvious one-sentence definition.\u201d (2017, 560) But as we\nhave described in Section 1, the innate/acquired distinction has been\nscientifically controversial ever since Darwin.\n\nThere is little cross-citation amongst these recent proposals to\nredefine innateness, raising two important issues for future research.\nFirst, are all these analyses extensionally equivalent, classifying\ntraits as innate or acquired to similar degree? In particular, do they\nagree on cases where there has been actual scientific disagreement\nabout whether the trait is innate, and cases which critics have used\nto agree that the distinction is not helpful? Second, and relatedly,\nalthough Khalidi is the only proposal explicitly restricted to one\nscientific field, do other analyses implicitly focus on how innateness\nis understood in some fields and neglect others?\n",
