Such a\nsemantics states truth conditions for counterfactuals in terms of\nsimilarity relations between possible worlds. Lewis famously espouses\nrealism about possible worlds, according to which non-actual possible\nworlds are real concrete entities on a par with the actual world\n(Lewis 1986e). However, most contemporary philosophers would seek to\ndeploy the explanatorily fruitful possible worlds framework while\ndistancing themselves from full-blown realism about possible worlds\nthemselves (see the entry on\n possible worlds).\n\nThe central notion of a possible world semantics for counterfactuals\nis a relation of comparative similarity between worlds (Lewis\n1973a). One world is said to be closer to actuality than\nanother if the first resembles the actual world more than the second\ndoes. In terms of this similarity relation, the truth condition for\nthe counterfactual \u201cIf A were (or had been) the case,\nC would be (or have been) the case\u201d is stated as\nfollows:\n\n(1)\n\u201cIf A were the case, C would be the\ncase\u201d is true in the actual world if and only if either\n(i) there are no possible A-worlds; or (ii) some\nA-world where C holds is closer to the actual world\nthan is any A-world where C does not hold.\n\n\nWe shall ignore the first case in which the counterfactual is\nvacuously true. The fundamental idea of this analysis is that the\ncounterfactual \u201cIf A were the case, C would be\nthe case\u201d is true just in case it takes less of a departure from\nactuality to make the antecedent true along with the consequent than\nto make the antecedent true without the consequent.\n\nIn terms of counterfactuals, Lewis defines a notion of causal\ndependence between events, which plays a central role in his theory of\ncausation (1973b).\n\n(2)\nWhere c and e are two distinct possible\nevents, e causally depends on c if and only\nif, if c were to occur e would occur; and if\n    c were not to occur e would not occur.\n\nThis condition states that whether e occurs or not depends on\nwhether c occurs or not. Where c and e are\nevents that actually occur, this truth condition can be simplified\nsomewhat. For in this case it follows from the second formal condition\non the comparative similarity relation that the counterfactual\n\u201cIf c were to occur e would occur\u201d is\nautomatically true: this formal condition implies that a\ncounterfactual with true antecedent and true consequent is itself\ntrue. Consequently, the truth condition for causal dependence\nbecomes:\n\n(3)\nWhere c and e are two distinct actual\nevents, e causally depends on c if and only\n    if, if c were not to occur e would not occur.\n\nThere are three important things to note about the definition of\ncausal dependence. First, it takes the primary relata of causal\ndependence to be events. Lewis\u2019s own theory of events\n(1986b) construes events as classes of possible spatiotemporal\nregions. However, different conceptions of events are compatible with\nthe basic definition (Kim 1973a; for an alternative broadly Lewisian\ntake on events see McDonnell 2016 and Kaiserman 2017). Indeed, it even\nseems possible to formulate it in terms of facts rather than events\n(Mellor 1995, 2004).\n\nSecond, the definition requires the causally dependent events to be\ndistinct from each other. Distinctness means that the events\nare not identical, neither is part of the other, and neither implies\nthe other. This qualification is important if spurious non-causal\ndependences are to be ruled out. (For this point see Kim 1973b and\nLewis 1986b.) For while you would not have written \u2018Larry\u2019\nif you had not written \u2018rr\u2019; and you would not have said\n\u2018Hello\u2019 loudly if you had not said \u2018Hello\u2019,\nneither dependence counts as a causal dependence since the paired\nevents are not distinct from each other in the required sense.\n\nConvinced by the need to make room in his analysis for causation by\n(and of) absence \u2013 as when the gardener\u2019s failure to water\nthe plants causes their death \u2013 Lewis later amended his view to\nthe view that causal dependence is a matter of counterfactual\ndependence between events or their absences (Lewis 2000: \u00a7X;\n2004b). We shall largely ignore this complication in what follows; for\nsome discussion of causation by absence see Schaffer 2000b, Beebee\n2004b, McGrath 2005, Livengood and Machery 2007, Dowe 2009.\n\nThird, the counterfactuals that are employed in the analysis are to be\nunderstood according to what Lewis calls the standard interpretation.\nThere are several possible ways of interpreting counterfactuals; and\nsome interpretations give rise to spurious non-causal dependences\nbetween events. For example, suppose that the events c and\ne are effects of a common cause d. It is tempting to\nreason that there must be a causal dependence between c and\ne by engaging in the following piece of counterfactual\nreasoning: if c had not occurred, then d would not\nhave occurred; and if d had not occurred, e would\nnot have occurred. But Lewis says the former counterfactual, which he\ncalls a backtracking counterfactual, is not to be used in the\nassessment of causal dependence. The right counterfactuals to be used\nare non-backtracking counterfactuals that typically hold the\npast fixed up until the time (or just before the time) at which the\ncounterfactual\u2019s antecedent is supposed to obtain. Thus if\nc had not occurred, d \u2013 which in fact occurred\nbefore c \u2013 would have occurred anyway; so on the\nstandard interpretation, where backtracking counterfactuals are false,\nthe inference to the claim that e causally depends on\nc is blocked.\n1.2 The Temporal Asymmetry of Causal Dependence\n\nWhat constitutes the direction of the causal relation? Why is this\ndirection typically aligned with the temporal direction from past to\nfuture? In answer to these questions, Lewis (1979) argues that the\ndirection of causation is the direction of causal dependence; and it\nis typically true that events causally depend on earlier events but\nnot on later events. He emphasises the contingency of the latter fact\nbecause he regards backwards or time-reversed causation as a\nconceptual possibility that cannot be ruled out a priori.\nAccordingly, he dismisses any analysis of counterfactuals that would\ndeliver the temporal asymmetry by conceptual fiat.\n\nLewis\u2019s explanation of the temporal asymmetry of counterfactual\ndependence comes from a combination of his analysis of the similarity\nrelation together with the (alleged) \u2018asymmetry of\noverdetermination\u2019 \u2013 a contingent feature of the world.\nAccording to this analysis, there are several respects of similarity\nto be taken into account in evaluating non-backtracking\ncounterfactuals: similarity with respect to laws of nature and also\nsimilarity with respect to particular matters of fact. Worlds are more\nsimilar to the actual world the fewer miracles or violations of the\nactual laws of nature they contain. Again, worlds are more similar to\nthe actual world the greater the spatio-temporal region of perfect\nmatch of particular fact they have with the actual world. If the laws\nof the actual world are deterministic, these rules will clash in\nassessing which counterfactual worlds are more similar to the actual\nworld. For a world that makes a counterfactual antecedent true must\ndiffer from the actual world either in allowing some violation of the\nactual laws (a \u2018divergence miracle\u2019), or in differing from\nthe actual world in particular fact. Lewis\u2019s analysis allows a\ntradeoff between these competing respects of similarity in such cases.\nIt implies that worlds with an extensive region of perfect match of\nparticular fact can be considered very similar to the actual world\nprovided that the match in particular facts with the actual world is\nachieved at the cost of a small, local miracle, but not at the cost of\na big, diverse miracle.\n\nTaken by itself, this account contains no built-in time asymmetry.\nThat comes only when the account is combined with the asymmetry of\noverdetermination: the (alleged) fact that effects are rarely\noverdetermined by their causes, but causes are very often\noverdetermined by their effects. Taking an example from Elga (2000):\nsuppose that Gretta cracks an egg at 8.00 (event c), pops it in\nthe frying pan, and eats it for her breakfast. What would have\nhappened had c not occurred? The right answer (Answer 1) is\nthat the egg would not then have been fried and Gretta would not have\neaten it \u2013 and not (Answer 2) that she would still have fried\nand eaten the egg, but these events would somehow have come about\ndespite her failing to crack it in the first place. The question is:\nhow does Lewis\u2019s analysis of the similarity relation deliver Answer\n1 and not Answer 2? In particular, consider worlds where there is\nperfect match of particular fact until just before 8.00, and then a\nmiracle, and then no perfect match of particular fact thereafter. Call\nthe closest such world World 1. Now consider worlds where there is no\nperfect match of particular fact before 8.00 (and in particular,\nGretta does not crack the egg), a miracle just after 8.00, and\nthen perfect match of particular fact thereafter. Call the closest\nsuch world World 2. (Intuitively, in the first case we keep the past\nfixed, insert a miracle just before 8.00 so that c doesn\u2019t\noccur, and the future unfolds thereafter according to the (actual)\nlaws. In the second case, we keep the future fixed, insert a miracle\njust after 8.00 so that c doesn\u2019t occur, and the past\nunfolds according to the (actual) laws.) Why is World 1 closer to\nactuality than is World 2?\n\nLewis\u2019s answer to that question comes from the fact that\nc leaves very many traces: at 8.02, for example, there is the\negg cooking in the pan, the cracked empty shell in the bin, traces of\nraw egg on Gretta\u2019s fingers, her memory of having just now cracked\nit, and so on. So in World 2, Gretta fails to crack the egg but then,\nshortly thereafter, seems to remember cracking it, there is the egg in\nthe pan, the empty shell in the bin, and so on. So World 2 \u2013\nsince it contains all of these events without the egg being cracked in\nthe first place \u2013 needs to contain not just one miracle but\nseveral: one to take care of each of these effects. World 1, by\ncontrast, requires just the one small miracle to stop Gretta cracking\nthe egg. Hence World 2 contains a \u2018big, diverse\u2019 miracle while\nWorld 1 contains just one small miracle; hence World 1 is closer to\nactuality than is World 2; hence Lewis\u2019s analysis yields the correct\nresult that had Gretta not cracked the egg, she would not have eaten\nit.\n\nThe result in Gretta\u2019s case generalises to the extent that causes\nare overdetermined by their effects but effects are not overdetermined\nby their causes. Overdetermination of effects by causes does of course\nhappen \u2013 as when the victim is simultaneously shot by several\nassassins \u2013 but it is relatively rare, and even when it happens\nthe effect is overdetermined only by a handful of events. By contrast,\nthe leaving of traces is ubiquitous \u2013 and (or so Lewis needs to\nthink) the extent of overdetermination, in any given case, is much\ngreater than in cases of cause-to-effect overdetermination. Both of\nthese, however, are contingent features of the actual world (or so\nLewis claims; but see \u00a72.1 below).\n\nIn general, then, the symmetric analysis of similarity and the de\nfacto asymmetry of overdetermination together imply that worlds\nthat accommodate counterfactual changes by preserving the actual past\nand allowing for divergence miracles are more similar to the actual\nworld than worlds that accommodate such changes by allowing for\nconvergence miracles that preserve the actual future. This fact in\nturn implies that, where the asymmetry of overdetermination obtains,\nthe present counterfactually depends on the past, but not on the\nfuture.\n1.3 Transitivity and Preemption\n\nAs Lewis notes (1973b), causal dependence between actual events is\nsufficient for causation, but not necessary: it is possible to have\ncausation without causal dependence. A standard case of\n\u2018pre-emption\u2019 will illustrate this. Suppose that two shooters\nconspire to assassinate a hated dictator, agreeing that one or other\nwill shoot the dictator on a public occasion. Acting side by side,\nassassins A and B find a good vantage point, and,\nwhen the dictator appears, both take aim (events a and b\nrespectively). A pulls her trigger and fires a shot that hits\nits mark, but B desists from firing when he sees A\npull her trigger. Here assassin A\u2019s actions (such as\nher taking aim) are causes of the dictator\u2019s death, while\nB\u2019s actions (such as his taking aim) are merely\npreempted potential causes. (Lewis distinguishes such cases of\npreemption from cases of symmetrical overdetermination\nin which two processes terminate in the effect, with neither process\npreempting the other. Lewis believes that these cases are not suitable\ntest cases for a theory of causation since they do not elicit clear\njudgements.) The problem raised by this example of preemption is that\nboth actions are on a par from the point of view of causal dependence:\nhad neither A nor B acted, then the dictator would\nnot have died; and if either had acted without the other, the dictator\nwould have died.\n\nTo overcome this problem Lewis extends causal dependence to a\ntransitive relation by taking its ancestral. He defines a causal\nchain as a finite sequence of actual events c,\nd, e, \u2026 where d causally depends on\nc, e on d, and so on throughout the\nsequence. Then causation is finally defined in these terms:\n\n(4)\nc is a cause of e if and only if there\n    exists a causal chain leading from c to e.\n\nGiven the definition of causation in terms of causal chains, Lewis is\nable to distinguish preempting actual causes (such as a) from\npreempted potential causes (such as b). There is a causal chain\nrunning from a to the dictator\u2019s death, but no such\nchain running from b to the dictator\u2019s death. Take, for\nexample, as an intermediary event occurring between a and the\ndictator\u2019s death, the bullet from A\u2019s gun\nspeeding through the air in mid-trajectory. The speeding bullet\ncausally depends on a, since that particular bullet would not\nhave been in mid-trajectory had A not taken aim; and the\ndictator\u2019s death causally depends on the speeding bullet, since\nby the time the bullet is in mid-trajectory B has refrained\nfrom firing so that the dictator would not have died without the\npresence of the speeding bullet. (Recall that we are not allowed to\n\u2018backtrack\u2019: it is not true that if the bullet had not been\nmid-trajectory A would not have taken aim, and hence it is not\ntrue that had the bullet not been mid-trajectory B would have\nfired after all.) Hence, we have a causal chain, and so causation. But\nno corresponding intermediary can be found between b and the\ndictator\u2019s death; hence b does not count as causes of\nthe death.\n\nLewis\u2019s definition of causation also delivers the result that\ncausation is a transitive relation: whenever c causes d\nand d causes e, it will also be true that c\ncauses e. The transitivity of causation fits with at least some\nof our explanatory practices. For example, historians wishing to\nexplain some significant historical event will trace the explanation\nback through a number of causal links, concluding that the event at\nthe beginning of the causal chain is responsible for the event being\nexplained. As we shall see later, however, some authors have claimed\nthat causation is not in fact transitive.\n1.4 Chancy Causation\n\nSo far we have considered how the counterfactual theory of causation\nworks under the assumption of determinism. But what about causation\nwhen determinism fails? Lewis (1986c) argues that chancy causation is\na conceptual possibility that must be accommodated by a theory of\ncausation. Indeed, contemporary physics tells us the actual world\nabounds with probabilistic processes that are causal in character. To\ntake a familiar example (Lewis 1986c): suppose that you mischievously\nhook up a bomb to a radioactive source and Geiger counter in such a\nway that the bomb explodes if the counter registers a certain number\nof clicks within ten minutes. If it happens that the counter registers\nthe required number of clicks and the bomb explodes, your act caused\nthe explosion, even though there is no deterministic connection\nbetween them: consistent with the actual past and the laws, the Geiger\ncounter might not have registered sufficiently many clicks.\n\nIn principle a counterfactual analysis of causation is well placed to\ndeal with chancy causation, since counterfactual dependence does not\nrequire that the cause was sufficient, in the circumstances, for the\neffect \u2013 it only requires that the cause was necessary in the\ncircumstances for the effect. The problem posed by abandoning the\nassumption of determinism, however, is that pervasive indeterminism\nundermines the plausibility of the idea that \u2013 preemption and\noverdetermination aside \u2013 effects generally counterfactually\ndepend on their causes. In the Geiger counter case above, for example,\nsuppose that the chance of the bomb exploding can be altered by means\nof a dial. (A low setting means the Geiger counter needs to register a\nlot of clicks in order for the bomb to go off in the next ten minutes,\nthus making the explosion very unlikely; a high setting means it needs\nto register very few clicks, thus making the explosion very likely.)\nThe dial is on a low setting; I increase the chance of the bomb\nexploding by turning it up. My act was a cause of the explosion, but\nit\u2019s not true that, had I not done it, the bomb would not have\nexploded; it would merely have been very unlikely to do so. \n\nIn order to accommodate chancy causation, Lewis (1986c) defines a more\ngeneral notion of causal dependence in terms of chancy\ncounterfactuals. These counterfactuals are of the form \u201cIf\nA were the case Pr (C) would be\nx\u201d, where the counterfactual is an ordinary\nwould-counterfactual, interpreted according to the semantics above,\nand the Pr operator is a probability operator with narrow\nscope confined to the consequent of the counterfactual. Lewis\ninterprets the probabilities involved as temporally indexed\nsingle-case chances. (See his (1980) for the theory of single-case\nchance.)\n\nThe more general notion of causal dependence reads:\n\n(5)\nWhere c and e are distinct actual events,\ne causally depends on c if and only if, if\nc had not occurred, the chance of e\u2019s\noccurring would be much less than its actual chance.\n\nThis definition covers cases of deterministic causation in which the\nchance of the effect with the cause is 1 and the chance of the effect\nwithout the cause is 0. But it also allows for cases of irreducible\nprobabilistic causation where these chances can take non-extreme\nvalues, as in the Geiger-counter-with-dial example above. It is\nsimilar to the central notion of probabilistic relevance used in\nprobabilistic theories of type-causation, except that it employs\nchancy counterfactuals rather than conditional probabilities. (See the\ndiscussion in Lewis 1986c for the advantages of the counterfactual\napproach over the probabilistic one. Also see the entry\n probabilistic causation.)\n\nThe rest of the theory of chancy causation follows the outlines of the\ntheory of deterministic causation: again, we have causation when we\nhave one or more steps of causal dependence.\n",
