    "main_text": "God\u2019s existence and attributes || God\u2019s existence:\n3.1 God\u2019s existence:\n\n\nIn the introduction of the second part of the Guide of the\nPerplexed, Maimonides summarizes twenty-five premises of\nAristotelian science (and one more that Maimonides attributes to the\nphilosopher: the eternity of the world). In the first chapter of the\nsecond part, Maimonides gives philosophical (i.e., [neo-]Aristotelian)\nproofs of the three principal beliefs relating to God: his existence;\nhis unity, and his immateriality. In the first part of the first essay,\nCrescas explains these twenty-six premises and the six proofs offered\nby Maimonides on behalf of the Aristotelians. In the second part of\nthis essay, Crescas critiques fourteen of the premises of Aristotelian\nscience. Afterwards he argues against Maimonides\u2019 six proofs of the\nexistence of God, his unity, and his immateriality.\n\n\nIn the third part of the second essay, Crescas analyzes the true\nmeaning of these three beliefs and asks whether we can prove them. He\ncomes to the conclusion that he can prove the existence of God. In his\nopinion the only way to prove the existence of God is via the need for\na first cause. If every single thing in the universe is caused, their\nexistence is only possible (just as is their inexistence) and so we\nneed a first cause that necessitates their existence as opposed to\ntheir\n non-existence.[15]\n\n\nIn Crescas\u2019s opinion, we can also prove the simplicity of God,\nbut we cannot prove the uniqueness of God. We can summarize this\nphilosophical enquiry by saying that Crescas thinks that philosophy can\nprove the existence of a simple cause of the world, but it cannot\narrive at the uniqueness God of the Bible. On this point Crescas comes\nto the conclusion that the only way to know the true essence of the\ndivinity is to learn it from the divine revelation (the Torah and the\ntradition).\n\n\nThis philosophical development is very important for the\ncomprehension of the relation between philosophy and revelation in the\nthought of Crescas. The major trend of Jewish philosophers, and chiefly\nMaimonides, was to prove that people can come closest to the true\nunderstanding of God through philosophy. These philosophers wanted to\nput philosophy on the same level of truth as the Torah. In their\nopinion, one must interpret the Torah according to science, and the\nTorah does not teach anything that philosophy cannot access on its own.\nIn Crescas\u2019s opinion, the true meaning of the Torah (and the\ntradition) cannot go against philosophy, but philosophy by itself\ncannot reveal the entire truth that the Torah contains. One of the\ngoals of God\u2019s revelation is to give us some true beliefs that\nphilosophy (and human speculation alone) cannot discover. This\ndevelopment elevated the Torah and the tradition to a higher level of\ntruth than that of philosophy. There are some questions in which\nphilosophy and revelation provide the same answers, but there are also\nbeliefs that pure philosophy cannot claim, such that only revelation\ncan tell us what the truth is.\n",
