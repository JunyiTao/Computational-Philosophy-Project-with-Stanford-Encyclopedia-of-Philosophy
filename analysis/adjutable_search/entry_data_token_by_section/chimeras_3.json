    "main_text": "The Borderline-Personhood Argument\n4. The Borderline-Personhood Argument\n\n\nMost groups that have issued an opinion on chimeras acknowledge the\nexistence of traditional animal ethics issues, but are content to\nassert without argument that the use of non-human animals in chimeric research is\njustified because of its scientific and, ultimately, clinical\nimportance. On the one hand, this attitude seriously underestimates the\ndifficulties, abundantly articulated in the animal ethics literature,\nof justifying the use of non-human animals along these lines without either (a)\nimplying false and morally odious conclusions about research on\ncognitively disabled humans or (b) taking an uncharitable view of the\ncognitive capacities of non-human animals that is inconsistent with current\nresearch on animal psychology. On the other hand, this attitude\nprobably reflects a realistic assessment of the limited willingness of\nthese groups\u2019 audiences (primarily scientists and research oversight\nbodies) to seriously consider the possibility that most animal research\nis ethically unjustifiable. The earliest evaluation of chimeras in terms of traditional animal ethics considerations is by David DeGrazia,\nwho has argued that the psychological characteristics of great apes\n(chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans) makes them \u201cborderline\npersons.\u201d Borderline persons have full, or near-full moral status,\nwhich makes it unethical to use borderline persons in what DeGrazia\ncalls \u201cneural chimeric research,\u201d research intended to lead to the\ngrowth of human neurons in the subjects\u2019 brains (DeGrazia 2007,\n325).\n\n\nWhat is it to be a person? Being a human being (viz., being a member\nof the species Homo sapiens) is neither necessary nor\nsufficient for being a person: newborns are human beings but are not\nyet persons, and members of other advanced, now-extinct hominid\nspecies were persons but were not human beings. Rather, DeGrazia says,\nto be a person is to have the capacity for sufficiently complex forms\nof consciousness (ibid., 319). More specifically, albeit\nstill vaguely, to be a person is to have \u201cenough\u201d of the\nfollowing properties to a \u201chigh enough\u201d degree: autonomy,\nrationality, self-awareness, linguistic competence, sociability, moral\nagency, and intentionality in action (ibid., 320).\n\n\nGreat apes deliberate, plan, and reason, thus displaying rationality\nand the capacity for intentional action. They exhibit bodily\nself-awareness, as evidenced through imitations of bodily gestures and\ntheir reactions to mirrors. They also exhibit social self-awareness, as\nevidenced by their knowledge of their position within their group\u2019s\nsocial hierarchies. Their social self-awareness also, ipso facto,\ndemonstrates their sociability, which is also implied by the cultural\ntransmission of accumulated knowledge in primate communities. The\nexistence of a limited degree of moral agency is also supported by\napparently altruistic actions for which no conditioning or instinctual\nexplanation seems plausible.\n\n\nAlthough great apes exhibit such forms of consciousness, DeGrazia also\nnotes that primarily because of their lack of linguistic competence\n(itself important to personhood and also relevant because it limits\nthe cognitive capacities available), non-linguistically trained great\napes \u201care not so well endowed with [personhood-relevant] traits\nthat they clearly qualify as persons\u201d (ibid.,\n321). They do not even fare well compared to normal human children,\nwho \u201care clearly capable of introspective awareness \u2026,\nrobustly competent in language, and more likely to show signs of\nautonomy\u201d (ibid., 322). Despite his use of the adverb\n\u201cclearly\u201d which suggests that this is an epistemic claim,\nthe conclusion is metaphysical: \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t know\nenough about them to say whether they are persons. Rather, they exist\nin the gray area between paradigm persons and the vast majority of\nanimals who definitely are not persons\u201d (ibid.,\n322).\n\n\nSo what moral status do borderline persons have? On some views,\nmoral status is a binary property; an individual either has moral\nstatus or it does not. Given that all sentient animals have at least\nsome moral status, it would follow on such a view that all sentient\nanimals have full moral status. A fortiori, borderline persons, being\nsentient, would have full moral status.\n\n\nOn other views, moral status comes in degrees and while paradigmatic\npersons (individuals that fully satisfy the criteria for personhood)\nhave full moral status, merely sentient animals (animals that are\nsentient but that are clearly not persons) have a lower degree of moral\nstatus. DeGrazia distinguishes between two views of what such a\ndifference in moral status consists in, the Unequal Consideration Model\nand the Unequal Interests Model. On the Unequal Consideration Model,\nthis difference consists in its being the case that the interests of\nparadigmatic persons matter more, in and of themselves, than the equal\ninterests of merely sentient animals. For example, causing a harm of a\ncertain magnitude to a paradigmatic person is morally worse than\ncausing a harm of the same magnitude to a merely sentient animal, even\nsetting aside the fact that the harm to the paradigmatic person might\nwell cause additional negative effects not caused by inflicting the\nsame harm on a merely sentient animal (Harman 2003).\n\n\nAccording to the Unequal Interests Model, the difference in moral\nstatus between paradigmatic persons and merely sentient animals\nconsists in the fact that paradigmatic person have interests of\nsignificantly greater weight than the interests of merely sentient\nanimals. These weightier interests mean that killing a paradigmatic\nperson and thereby frustrating those interests will generally be\nmorally worse in and of itself than killing a merely sentient animal.\nMoreover, harms that appear comparable at first glance, say, causing a\ncertain kind of injury, are generally morally worse in and of\nthemselves, when inflicted upon a paradigmatic person than on a merely\nsentient animal. This is because the same kind of injury is likely to\nimpair the interests of the paradigmatic person more severely than it\nwould the interests of a merely sentient animal.\n\n\nIt should be noted that the Unequal Consideration Model is compatible\nwith assigning moral significance to the difference in interests cited\nby the Unequal Interest Model. A proponent of the Unequal\nConsideration Model could, for example, agree that being confined in a\ncage generally causes a much greater harm to a paradigmatic person\nthan to a merely sentient animal. Differences between the two\nframeworks arise when the harms to the interests of the individuals\nare not merely similarly describable (e.g., \u201cbeing\nconfined\u201d), but are in fact of equal magnitude: the Unequal\nInterests Model is committed to the conclusion that such harms are\nequally morally problematic in and of themselves while the Unequal\nConsideration Model is compatible with the conclusion that the harm to\nthe paradigmatic person is more morally problematic in and of itself\nthan the equal harm to the merely sentient animal.\n\n\nAccording to these two models, what moral status do borderline\npersons have? DeGrazia\u2019s argument continues: personhood-relevant\nproperties come in degrees, and so on the Unequal Consideration Model,\nit is plausible to say that the amount of consideration an individual\nis due is proportional to its \u201ccognitive, emotional, and social\ncomplexity\u201d (DeGrazia 2007, 323). Depending on how fine-grained the\naccount is, borderline persons would therefore either have the same\nmoral status as a paradigmatic person (viz., full moral status) or, at\nmost, be due only slightly less consideration than paradigmatic\npersons.\n\n\nAccording to the Unequal Interest Model, the difference between\nparadigmatic persons and borderline persons consists in their different\ninterests. But, here again, DeGrazia maintains, the differences between\nparadigmatic persons and borderline persons are relatively slight, and\nso on this account of moral status, borderline persons will either have\nfull moral status or, at most, have a moral status very near full moral\nstatus.\n\n\nOn any reasonable view of moral status, then, there will not be a\nlarge difference between the consideration due a borderline person and\nthe consideration due a paradigmatic person, and a borderline person\nshould therefore be viewed as analogous to a child: \u201cnot as\nsubstantially autonomous or as having full-fledged moral agency but as\ndeserving moral protections of full strength\u201d (ibid.,\n323).\n\n\nSuch an individual, with full or near-full moral status, should not be\nused in research unless (a) the research is more or less compatible\nwith the individual\u2019s best interests, (b) poses no more than minimal\nrisk, except where greater risks are justified by therapeutic\npotential to the individual, and (c) the individual has not\nmeaningfully dissented, unless participation is of pressing\ntherapeutic urgency for the individual (ibid., 323). But\nneural chimeric research does not come close to satisfying those\nstandards. The research is more than minimal risk, is not intended for\nany therapeutic benefit for the animal, and at this experimental\nstage, could not reasonably be intended as such. To take an extreme,\nalbeit hypothetical, example, the idea of a human/chimp neural chimera\nin which the human and chimp phenotypic traits are thoroughly mixed is a chilling\none. All great apes are social creatures, and such an individual might\nwell be rejected by both species, evoking the tragic plight of\nFrankenstein\u2019s monster. DeGrazia\u2019s argument, however, does not only\napply to such science fiction scenarios. Although he does not draw\nthis conclusion, if great apes have full or near-full moral status,\nthen it is probably impermissible to use them in any kind of chimeric\nresearch in which scientists are currently interested.\n\n\nDefenders of research on non-human animals typically object that\narguments against such research are overbroad. Where a defender of\nanimal research would locate the main problem with the\nBorderline-Personhood Argument depends on whether moral status is a\nbinary property or whether it admits of degrees. If moral status is a\nbinary property, then, given that even merely sentient animals have\nsome moral status, it follows that even merely sentient animals have\nfull moral status. The Borderline-Personhood Argument then implies\nthat any research on any sentient animal is subject to conditions\n(a)\u2013(c). Given that all vertebrates are sentient, this would\nprohibit the use of any vertebrates, even guppies, in any\nnon-therapeutic research that was more than minimal risk, irrespective\nof how large the benefit for other individuals might be. Although some\nanimal rights theorists would accept this conclusion, defenders of\nanimal research will take it as a reductio of the Borderline-Person\nArgument, maintaining that if full moral status really is as\nubiquitous as that, then DeGrazia\u2019s claim about the research\nprotections owed individuals with full or near-full moral status is\noverly strict.\n\n\nIf moral status admits of degrees, then the defender of animal\nresearch would locate the main problem with the Borderline-Personhood\nArgument in its claim that there are only slight differences in\npersonhood-relevant properties between borderline persons and\nparadigmatic persons. In fact, the differences between even a\nlanguage-trained chimpanzee and a normal adult human are quite large.\nAs DeGrazia himself argues elsewhere, for example, only normal adult\nhumans are capable of what he calls \u201cfull-fledged moral\nagency\u201d (1996, 199\u2013210). Now, the Borderline-Personhood\nArgument only requires that borderline personhood be sufficient, not\nnecessary, for full or near-full moral status, but both the Unequal\nConsideration Model and the Unequal Interests Model quite generally\nrelate moral status to personhood-relevant properties. The question\ntherefore arises as to why these vast differences in\npersonhood-relevant properties do not underwrite a large difference in\nmoral status and a concomitant difference in the research protections\nowed to individuals of the two groups.\n\n\nDeGrazia could respond that, were they to do so, it would follow\nthat human borderline persons (he gives the example of an 18\nmonth toddler) would also have significantly reduced moral status,\nwhich is false (ibid., 322). But there are two problems with\nthis reply. First, it begs the question of why, on his view, there\nisn\u2019t a large difference in moral status between human borderline\npersons and human paradigmatic persons. The fact that large variations\nin personhood-relevant properties do not seem to affect the moral\nstatus of humans might support a very coarse-grained or threshold view\nof moral status, but it might instead indicate that personhood-relevant\nproperties are not as central to moral status as the Unequal\nConsideration Model and the Unequal Interest Model posit (Kittay 2005).\nSecond, if, as this response presupposes, the lack of\npersonhood-relevant properties of a non-human reduces its moral status\nonly if the same lack of personhood-relevant properties would reduce to\nthe same degree the moral status of a human, then the range of\nnon-humans with full or near-full moral status is much larger than\nDeGrazia seems willing to concede. After all, despite the near complete\nabsence of personhood-relevant properties of a healthy but premature\ninfant or an elderly person in the late stages of dementia, such\nindividuals have full or near-full moral status and are owed\nsignificant protections against being harmed in research (even though\ntheir cognitive capacities might affect what kinds of treatments are\nharms). Extending full or near-full moral status to all non-humans who\nsatisfied such a minimal threshold would have implications comparable\nto those of the view that moral status is a binary property, and\ndefenders of animal research would find them equally implausible.\n\n\nIt should be noted that the U.S. National Institutes of Health has\nceased funding biomedical research with chimpanzees, and many private\ncompanies have followed suit (Collins 2015; Human Society of the\nUnited States n.d.). With Gabon being the only remaining country that\nhas a captive research population of chimpanzees (Nature 2011), the\nquestion remains as to how applicable DeGrazia\u2019s arguments are to\nother great apes and other non-human primates.\nMore recent evaluations of chimeras in traditional animal ethics\nterms include work by Shaw, Dondorp, & de Wort (2014), who apply a\nthree R\u2019s framework (focusing on reduction, refinement, and\nreplacement) to argue for a generally favorable conclusion regarding\nthe use of chimeric non-human primates as a source of organs for\nxenotransplantation.
