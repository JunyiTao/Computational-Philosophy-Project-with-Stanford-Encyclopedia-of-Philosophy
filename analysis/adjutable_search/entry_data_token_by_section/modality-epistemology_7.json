    "main_text": "Varieties of Essentialism\n5. Varieties of Essentialism\n\nEssentialism has recently become a major area of investigation in the\nepistemology of modality. Essentialist accounts of modal knowledge\ndraw on results from recent metaphysical debates about essence.\nGenerally, metaphysical\n essentialism\n is the thesis that, in addition to mere accidental\nproperties, entities also have essential properties.\nTraditionally, essential properties have been analyzed as those that\nnecessarily belong to the objects that they pertain to. In\nhis influential (1994) article, however, Kit Fine has argued against\nthis analysis or reduction of essence to necessity. Fine provides\ncounterexamples to the traditional view by pointing out that there are\nproperties that an entity \\(x\\) has necessarily, though it is\nplausible that they do not belong to the essence of \\(x.\\) The notion\nof essence that Fine is working with is a broadly Aristotelian notion,\naccording to which the essence of an entity \\(x\\) is the real\ndefinition of \\(x\\). Real definitions are contrasted against\nnominal definitions. Nominal definitions define words that\nstand for entities in the world, while real definitions\ndefine entities themselves by telling us what is essential to them.\n(Note that the explanation of essence in terms of real definition is\nnot intended to be a reductive one.) For example, the nominal\ndefinition of \u201cwater\u201d is, say, the drinkable liquid that\nis found in rivers and lakes on Earth, while the real definition of\nwater is H2O. (Note that, besides Aristotle, this\ndefinitional notion of essence is already present in\n Locke\n and\n Husserl.)\n\nMost essentialist accounts in the epistemology of modality rely on\nthis Finean (or Neo-Aristotelian) notion of definitional essence. The\nrejection of the traditional account of essence, according to which\nessence reduces to necessity, paved the way for what can be called\nFinean Essentialism (FE), a very influential view in the\nmetaphysics of modality.\n\n(FE)\nMetaphysically necessities are true in virtue of (or: are\n grounded\n in) essentialist truths.\n\n\nSince our focus here is on essentialism as it is employed in the\nepistemology of modality, we refer readers interested in\nmetaphysical issues concerning (FE) elsewhere. (For discussion in\nfavor of (FE), see Lowe 2008, 2012; Hale 2002, 2013, 2018; Kment 2014,\n2021; Rosen 2015; Jago 2021; Tahko 2017, 2018; Wallner 2020; Wallner\n& Vaidya 2020; and Wilsch 2017. For criticism, see Della Rocca\n1996a,b; Gorman 2005; Zalta 2006; Correia 2007; Cowling 2013; Wildman\n2013; and Livingstone-Banks 2017; as well as Leech 2018; Mackie\nforthcoming; Noonan 2018; Romero 2019; Van Cleve 2018; and Wildman\n2021.)\n\nThe core idea of essentialist accounts in the epistemology of modality\nis that we acquire modal knowledge on the basis of knowledge of\nessence. But note that\n (FE),\n i.e., the fact that essences metaphysically ground modality,\nby no means entails that knowledge of modality must proceed\nvia knowledge of essence. Otherwise put, metaphysical priority\ndoesn\u2019t require epistemic priority. Nonetheless, on the basis of\n(FE) essentialists identify knowledge of essence as one chief pathway\nto modal knowledge.\n\nOne of the reasons for the growth of interest in essentialism in the\nepistemology of modality stems from the criticism or incompleteness of\nother accounts based on understanding, conceivability, or\ncounterfactual reasoning. An understanding-based theory such as\nPeacocke\u2019s, for example, naturally integrates an essentialist\ncomponent by identifying the constitutive principles for modal\nknowledge with essentialist principles. Likewise, theories of\nconceivability such as Chalmers\u2019 and Yablo\u2019s, as well as\nWilliamson\u2019s counterfactual theory, have been criticized for\nfailing to take adequate account of the role of essences in the\nacquisition of modal knowledge (e.g., Roca-Royes 2011a,b; Tahko 2012;\nVaidya & Wallner 2021).\n\nThe essentialist claim that our modal knowledge depends on our\nessentialist knowledge raises two main questions:\n\nHow do we gain knowledge of essences in the\nfirst place?\nHow do we transition from essentialist\nknowledge to modal knowledge?\n\n\nFollowing Fine, E.J. Lowe (2008, 2012) characterizes the essence of\n\\(x\\) as the real definition of \\(x\\). Lowe\u2019s answer to\n (a)\n is thus straightforward: we know the essence of \\(x\\) simply by\nunderstanding what x is. Unfortunately, Lowe does not\nelaborate on his notion of understanding (see Tahko 2017,\n2018 for discussion). Instead, he puts forward a transcendental\nargument for the claim that we have knowledge of essence. According to\nthis,\n\n\nKnowing an entity\u2019s essence is simply knowing what that entity\nis. And at least in the case of some entities, we must be\nable to know what they are, because otherwise it would be\nhard to see how we could know anything at all about them. (Lowe 2012:\n944; see Sgaravatti 2016 for criticism)\n\n\nCrucially, \u201cknowing what things are\u201d is meant to\ncapture knowledge of properties without which the object in question\nwould not be the thing it is. That is to say, Lowe does not talk about\nmere contingent classifications (such as, say, being a gift\nor being located at the doorstep) but essential properties\nthat figure in the real definition of a thing.\n\nBob Hale\u2019s (2013, 2021) answer to\n (a)\n is twofold. He distinguishes between a priori and a\nposteriori knowledge of essence. In the case of a priori\nknowledge of essence, essentialist knowledge is based on knowledge of\nmeaning. Hale acknowledges the difference between\nreal and nominal definitions. He then argues that\nsometimes both a nominal and a real definition of an entity \\(x\\) can\nbe given by using the same words. For example, Hale argues that\nknowing the nominal definition of the word \u201crectangle\u201d,\nnamely knowing the necessary and sufficient conditions for the\napplication of the word, suffices for knowing a priori the\nreal definition or essence of being a rectangle (i.e., a\nfour-sided closed figure consisting of four right angles).\n\nAdditionally, Hale maintains that even where there is no\nexplicit nominal definition for a word, like for example in\nthe case of basic logical constants, such as \u201cand\u201d,\n\n\nknowing what [the word] \u201cand\u201d means is sufficient for\nknowledge of the essence of truth-functional conjunction. (Hale 2013:\n258)\n\n\nSo, for Hale we can gain knoweldge of essence a priori via\nboth implicit and explit knowledge of meaning.\n\nOn the other hand, with regard to a posteriori knowledge of\nessence, Hale relies on a Kripke-style deduction model.\n\n(H1)\nIf some \\(x\\) is \\(F\\), then it is essential to \\(x\\) that it is\n\\(F\\).\n(H2)\n\\(x\\) is \\(F\\).\n(H3)\nThus, it is essential to \\(x\\) that it is \\(F\\).\n\n\nOf course, (H1) is not going to be true for all instances of \\(x\\) and\nF. However, Hale thinks that one can come to know in an a\npriori manner claims such as if x is human, then it is\nessential to x that it is human. Similarly, we know that it is\nnot true that if \\(x\\) is a musician, then it is\nessential to \\(x\\) that she is a musician. According to Hale,\nthis is done by distinguishing between pure and impure\nsortals (2013: 270\u2013275). So, for Hale, the major premise in\n(H1) is known a priori. The minor premise in (H2) might be a\npiece of a posteriori knowledge, such as, e.g., that Joanie\nis a human. When (H2) is a posteriori, the conclusion (H3) is\nalso a posteriori, since the combination of an a\npriori premise and an a posteriori premise always yields\nan a posteriori conclusion.\n\nIn sum, Hale holds that knowledge of essences can be gained from\nknowledge of meaning as well as from knowledge that is established via\nempirical investigation. By contrast, for Lowe the source of knowledge\nof essence is understanding, which is different from both knowledge of\nmeaning and empirical investigation. (Still, Lowe doesn\u2019t mean\nto rule out that a posteriori knowledge may contribute to our\nknowledge of essence, especially concerning kinds. See Tahko (2017,\n2018) for discussion of Lowe\u2019s view concerning empirical\nknowledge of essence.) Although Hale and Lowe\u2019s views on how we may\ngain knowledge of essences differ, they agree on how knowledge of\nessences can give us in turn modal knowledge, namely by deductive\ninference. The argument is as follows:\n\n(E1)\nIf it is essential to \\(x\\) that it is \\(F\\), then it is necessary\nthat \\(x\\) is F.\n(E2)\nIt is essential to \\(x\\) that it is \\(F\\).\n(E3)\nThus, it is necessary that \\(x\\) is \\(F\\).\n\n\nAs we saw, inferring\n (H3)\n from\n (H1)\n and\n (H2)\n yields knowledge of essence. Then, inferring (E3) from (E1) and (E2)\nis to use knowledge of essence to gain knowledge of necessity.\n\nBoris Kment (2021) puts forward an account of modal knowledge based on\nhis own modal metaphysics (2014). On Kment\u2019s metaphysical\nframework, modal facts are partially grounded in what he calls\nmetaphysical laws, which also comprise essentialist\ntruths. Thereby, much of our modal knowledge for Kment depends on\nknowledge of the metaphysical laws, including essentialist truths.\nKment discusses two ways in which we may acquire knowledge of such\nlaws (i.e., two ways to answer\n question (b)\n above). First, abductively, via inference to the best\nexplanation (IBE). Second, we may come to know the metaphysical laws\nby relying on our conceptual or linguistic competence.\n\nAs to the first method, Kment holds that metaphysical laws (including\nessentialist principles) play a crucial role in both metaphysical and\ncausal explanation. Accounting for what grounds or causes some\nnon-fundamental fact crucially involves making assumptions about\nmetaphysical laws. As for IBE, Kment holds that\n\n\nan abductive inference that establishes the account [of grounding or\ncausation] will support these assumptions about metaphysical laws as\nwell. (Kment 2021: S1969)\n\n\nFor example, according to our best explanation, the fact that my cup\nof coffee is hotter than your glass of iced tea is grounded in the\nfact that the mean molecular kinetic energy of the former is higher\nthan that of the latter. Within Kment\u2019s framework, this account\nentails that there is a certain metaphysical covering law that is\ninstantiated in this particular instance of grounding. In this case,\nthe law in question is the real definition or essence of\nbeing-hotter-than: one object is hotter than another iff the\nmean molecular kinetic energy of the former exceeds that of the\nlatter. In effect, for Kment, the epistemology of metaphysical\n(essentialist) laws is a byproduct of the abductive\nepistemology of grounding and causation.\n\nAs for the method of conceptual competence, Kment remarks\nthat competence with a term often requires (at least implicit)\nknowledge of part or all of the real definition of the thing\npicked out by the term. For Kment, real definitions are a type of\nessentialist truths. To have competence in using the notions of\nmetaphysical necessity and possibility, one must know, at least\ntacitly, that metaphysical modality is connected to metaphysical laws,\nincluding laws that govern what is essential. (For a similar view, see\nPeacocke 1999,\n \u00a74.3\n above. The role of linguistic competence in the acquisition of\nessentialist knowledge has also been stressed by Hale 2013, 2021).\n\nThus, Kment\u2019s theory answers\n question (a)\n by appealing to IBE and conceptual competence. But what is his answer\nto\n question (b),\n namely, how are essentialist knowledge and modal knowledge connected?\nBy contrast with Lowe and Hale, who appeal to deductive inference from\nknowledge of essence to knowledge of necessity, Kment holds that\nessentialist knowledge contributes to our modal knowledge by\nrestricting methods such as conceiving and counterfactual reasoning,\nin other words, by providing epistemic friction, in the\nterminology introduced above. His account, thus, indicates a possible\nanswer to (PMEF) (see\n \u00a72).\n\nMark Jago (2021) also offers an essentialist account of modal\nknowledge. According to Jago, we can explain our knowledge of\nmetaphysical modality by way of our (implicit or explicit) knowledge\nof essence. Like others, Jago aims to refute long-standing skepticism\nagainst essences; to do so, he lays out a metaphysical account\naccording to which essences are simply bundles of located\nproperties:\n\n\nEssences are constitutive of material objects. Located\nproperties \u201cbundle\u201d together to form a material object;\nand each property in the bundle is essential to the material object\nthereby constituted. Each material object is numerically identical to\na located bundle of its essential properties. (Jago 2021: S1987; see\nalso Barker & Jago 2017)\n\n\nMoreover, for Jago we can refer and single out these bundles\nstraightforwardly, in thought or language, by conceptualizing them\nunder kinds. According to Jago,\n\n\nthere is a tendency linking (i) reference to a material object, (ii)\nour conceptualising that object under some kind \\(F\\), and (iii) our\nbelief that that object is essentially \\(F\\). (2021: S1992)\n\n\nNotwithstanding some exceptions to this tendency, Jago takes it to be\nappropriately reliable and safe from nearby error. On Jago\u2019s\nexternalist epistemology of essence, a belief constitutes\nknowledge if it has an appropriate connection to reality. He takes\nreliability and safety to constitute such an appropriate connection to\nreality. Hence, Jago concludes that\n\n\n[w]hen one has a referent \\(a\\) in mind and conceptualises it under\nsome kind \\(F\\), and thereby believes it to be essentially \\(F\\), that\nbelief will often constitute knowledge that \\(a\\) is essentially\n\\(F\\). (Jago 2021: S1992)\n\n\nKnowledge of essence is thus secured by a reliable connection with\nreality, which is due in part to the way we think about objects and\nform beliefs about them. Knowledge of essence, in turn, leads us to\nknowledge of necessity and possibility via a conceptual connection\nbetween essence and necessity. For Jago, \u201cit is a conceptual\ntruth that whatever is essentially \\(F\\) is necessarily \\(F\\)\u201d;\n(2021: S1994) thereby, possessing the concepts of\n\u201cessence\u201d and \u201cnecessity\u201d, together with the\nrelevant essentialist knowledge jointly results in knowledge of\nnecessity.\n\nAn account pairing essentialism with modal empiricism comes out of\nAntonella Mallozzi\u2019s (2021a, 2021e) work. According to Mallozzi,\nwe can clarify what the normative constraints on good modal reasoning\nare by appealing to essences. Specifically, she maintains that\nessences are special core properties that have distinctive explanatory\npowers in accounting for how things are\u2014as she puts it, essences\nare superexplanatory. Mallozzi focuses on examples involving\nkinds and illustrates how essences typically cause and explain many\nproperties and behaviors that consistently co-occur in the instances\nof kinds. For example, the atomic constitution of a chemical element,\nsay silver, explains why all samples of silver share a whole host of\nproperties, such as density, electrical and thermal conductivity,\ndisposition to combine chemically, and so on. Atomic number is, thus,\nthe essence or \u201cnature\u201d of silver, for Mallozzi, because\nof its powerful role in explaining the properties shared by all\nsamples of silver. Accordingly, given\n (FE),\n silver necessarily has that atomic constitution. Against\nlong-standing skepticism against essences, Mallozzi emphasizes that\nsuch superexplanatory one-to-many causal structures helps clarify in\nwhat sense essences are held to constitute the \u201cnature\u201d of\nthings, as well as how we can know about them. (Godman, Mallozzi,\n& Papineau 2020 further investigate the metaphysics of kinds in\nterms of superexplanatory properties, particularly for biological\nkinds.) Mallozzi gives a moderate empiricist answer to\n question (a)\n above. In most cases we acquire knowledge of essence empirically,\nlargely via scientific investigation aimed at discovering the relevant\ncausal and explanatory information. As to\n question (b),\n Mallozzi holds that once we have knowledge of essence, we may then\nproceed to gain knowledge of metaphysical necessity inferentially, via\na fundamental Kripkean bridge-principle (\u201cIf \\(X\\) is\nessentially \\(F\\), then necessarily \\(X\\) is \\(F\\)\u201d).\n\nVaidya (2010) has proposed an account of our knowledge of essence that\nis influenced by Husserl\u2019s (1973) method of eidetic\nvariation, according to which we get access to the essence of an\nobject by varying its features in imagination. If a feature is seen to\nbe invariant, then it is an essence. In contrast to other\nessentialists discussed here, Vaidya explicitly targets\nunderstanding and not knowledge of essence.\n(Following Kvanvig 2009, Vaidya takes understanding [but not\nknowledge] to be compatible with epistemic luck.) Taking\nHusserl\u2019s ideas only as a point of departure, Vaidya holds that\nwe can gain understanding of the essence of some object \\(x\\) by\nvarying properties of \\(x\\) in our imagination. Of those properties\nthat are invariant over the multiplicity of variations, we judge that\nthey are essential to \\(x\\). (See Wallner forthcoming for a discussion\nof Husserl\u2019s epistemology of essence in contrast to that of Lowe\nand Hale, and Michels (2020) for a critical discussion of Vaidya.)\nCritical Questions for Essentialism\n\nThe Existence Question: Some are skeptical that there\nis a real distinction between accidental and essential properties.\nQuine (1953 [1961], 1960) argued that whether or not a property is\nessential to an object depends on how we refer to it. More recently,\nSidelle (1989) has provided an anti-realist view of essences. Mackie\n(2006) and \u00c1sta (2008, 2010, 2013) have offered a critique of\nrealist approaches to essences. Further criticism of essences comes\nfrom recent philosophy of science. Particularly, several philosophers\nof biology have criticized biological essentialism (e.g., Ereshefsky\n2010; Leslie 2013; Okasha 2002; for discussion: Devitt 2021; Dumsday\n2012).\n\nThe Metaphysics of Essence Question: If knowledge of\nmodality depends on (or crucially involves) knowledge of essence, then\nwhat essences are metaphysically influences any story about how we\nknow about essence and, hence, modality. Hence, the following\nmetaphysical questions concerning essences are crucial for the\nepistemology of essence: What are essences? Are they the sum of the\nessential properties of a given entity, or kind? Are essences distinct\nentities from those things that they are essences of? Is (knowledge\nof) essence linked to (knowledge of) de dicto or de\nre necessity (or both)? Are there individual essences\nwhich uniquely identify a certain entity or only general essences that\npertain to kinds of entities? Do all entities have exactly the same\nkind of essence? For example, do social kinds have the same kind of\nessence that natural kinds, or mathematical kinds have?\n\nNonetheless, on the basis of\n (FE)\n essentialists identify knowledge of essence as one chief pathway to\nmodal knowledge.\n\nThe Transition Question: A central question for\nessentialism concerns the transition between knowledge of essence and\nknowledge of modality (see\n question (b)\n above). For deduction theories that deploy the inference from\n (E1)\n and\n (E2)\n to\n (E3),\n one should ask: how is the bridge-principle connecting essence to\nmodality, (E1), known? Horvath (2014) argues that it isn\u2019t clear\nhow we come to know the bridge principle (E1). As Horvath remarks, a\n(purportedly non-modal) real definition or essence-statement (like\n\u201cgold is essentially the element with the atomic number\n79\u201d) doesn\u2019t make any explicit claim about metaphysical\npossibility or necessity. Because of that, definitional essences do\nnot seem generally capable of explaining or grounding metaphysical\nmodality. As Mackie (forthcoming) puts it:\n\n\nIt looks as if the account of essence in terms of real definition is\nintended to deliver a modal rabbit out of a non-modal hat. And I\ndon\u2019t see how this can be done.\n\n\nRecently, however, Wallner and Vaidya (2020) have proposed a\nnon-reductive interpretation of Finean Essentialism,\naccording to which\n (E1)\n follows from the essence of essences in virtue of the fact that\nessences have modal bearing. Essences via their modal bearing\nconstrain what is objectively necessary and possible for a given\nentity. Hence, their view might provide an answer to this\nquestion.\n\nThe Language to Essence Question: Some essentialist\naccounts hold that knowledge of meaning or conceptual competence\nimportantly contributes to knowledge of essence (e.g., Hale\u2019s\nand Kment\u2019s). This raises a more specific transition question\nconcerning how we get to knowledge of essence via linguistic or\nconceptual competence. It might be argued that we acquire knowledge of\nessence by reflecting on our conceptual-linguistic practices.\nHowever, how could our conceptual or linguistic practices tell us what\nare the essential natures of mind-independent things? Most theorists\nappeal to implicit knowledge of essence. But what does this\nmean, exactly? Particularly, how do we find out what we know\nimplicitly?\n\nThe Completeness Question: According to Hale\u2019s\nepistemology of essence, we can come to know essentialist facts by\ndeducing them from essentialist principles (like in the inference from\n (H1)\n and\n (H2)\n to\n (H3)).\n However, one might ask whether knowledge of the essentialist\nprinciple in (H1) is not itself already essentialist knowledge. In\nother words, it might be questioned whether such an account of\nessentialist knowledge can be complete (for discussion: Wallner\nforthcoming). Wallner (forthcoming) also points out that in order for\nus to successfully employ Hale\u2019s distinction between pure and\nimpure sortals that is supposed to differentiate essential from\ninessential properties, we might have to presuppose essentialist\nknowledge.\n",
