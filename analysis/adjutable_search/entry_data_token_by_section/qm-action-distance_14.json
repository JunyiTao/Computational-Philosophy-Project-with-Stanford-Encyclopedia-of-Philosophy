Thus, pairs prepared with the same wave function have always\nthe same \u03bb state \u2014 a state that represents their\nquantum-equilbrium distribution for the EPR/B experiment. Accordingly,\n\u03bb-distribution fails. Do these models involve controllable\nprobabilistic dependence?\n\n\nRecall (section 5.1.2) that there are several models of state\nreduction in the literature. One of these models is the so-called\nnon-linear Continuous Stochastic Localization (CSL) models (see Pearle\n1989, Ghirardi, Pearle and Rimini 1990, Butterfield et al. 1993, and\nGhirardi et al. 1993). Butterfield et al. (1993) argue that in these\nmodels there is a probabilistic dependence of the outcome of the\nR-measurement on the process that leads to the (earlier) outcome of\nthe L-measurement. In these models, the process leading to the\nL-outcome (either z-spin \u2018up\u2019 or z-spin\n\u2018down\u2019) depends on the interaction between the L-particle\nand the L-apparatus (which results in an entangled state), and the\nspecific realization of the stochastic process that strives to\ncollapse this macroscopic superposition into a product state in which\nthe L-apparatus displays a definite outcome. And the probability of\nthe R-outcome depends on this process. For example, if this process is\none that gives rise to a z-spin \u2018up\u2019 (or renders\nthat outcome more likely), the probability of R-outcome\nz-spin \u2018up\u2019 is 0 (more likely to be 0); and if\nthis process is one that gives rise to a z-spin\n\u2018down\u2019 (or renders that outcome more likely), the\nprobability of R-outcome z-spin \u2018down\u2019 is 0 (more\nlikely to be 0). The question is whether there are controllable\nfactors that influence the probability of realizations of stochastic\nprocesses that lead to a specific L-outcome, so that it would be\npossible to increase or decrease the probability of the R-outcome. If\nsuch factors existed, controllable probabilistic dependence would be\npossible at least in theory. And if this kind of controllable\nprobabilistic dependence existed, \u03bb-distribution would also\nobtain; for if such dependence existed, the actual distribution of\npairs' states (in which the pair always have the same state, the\nquantum-mechanical state) would cease to be the quantum-equilbrium\ndistribution.\n",
