    "main_text": "Intergenerational Justice || Objections and Concerns\n3.3 Objections and Concerns\n\nThe previous subsections proceeded on the basis that there are duties\nof justice to future generations. It is worth noting here then that\nsome dispute that. The reasons they do so are not peculiar to the case\nof climate change, and are familiar from general debates about\nintergenerational justice (see entry on\n intergenerational justice).\n\nFor example, some have invoked Derek Parfit\u2019s Non Identity\nProblem (Parfit 1984: chapter 16) to call into question claims that\nthere are duties of justice to (remote) future generations (Broome\n2012: 61\u201364). They argue that since the decisions made now\naffect who gets born in the future they do not harm future generations\nfor they do not make them worse off than they would otherwise be\n(Broome 2012: 61\u201364; Parfit 1984: chapter 16).\n\nThis is not the place to discuss the Non Identity Problem in depth\n(see entry on\n nonidentity problem).\n It is, however, perhaps worth noting that many are not persuaded that\nthis argument shows that current generations lack duties of (climate)\njustice to future people. The nub of the issue is whether theories of\njustice are committed to a \u201cnarrow person-affecting\u201d point\nof view (Parfit 1984: 393\u2013395). Broome appears to assume that\nthey are. However, many others maintain that justice to future\ngenerations should not be conceived of in such narrow person-affecting\nterms (e.g., Reiman 2007: esp. 83\u201386 & 88\u201392).\nConsider, for example, sufficientarian accounts of our\nresponsibilities to the future. They maintain that there is a duty of\njustice to act in such a way that the standard of living of those who\nlive in the future is above a certain threshold. They are not\ncommitted to the thought that persons act unjustly only if\nthey render someone (future or present) worse off than they would\notherwise have been. Their claim is simply that persons of one\ngeneration act unjustly if, other things being equal, the outcome of\ntheir actions is that those who are alive in the future have a\nlower-than-sufficiency standard of living (see the entry on\n intergenerational justice,\n sections 3 & 4). The same point could be made about other\naccounts, whether egalitarian, prioritarian or Llavador et al.\u2019s\nview. \n",
