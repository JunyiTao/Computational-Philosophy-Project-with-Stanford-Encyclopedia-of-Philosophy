    "main_text": "\nJohn Locke\u2019s views on the nature of freedom of action and\nfreedom of will have played an influential role in the philosophy of\naction and in moral psychology. Locke offers distinctive accounts of\naction and forbearance, of will and willing, of voluntary (as opposed\nto involuntary) actions and forbearances, and of freedom (as opposed\nto necessity). These positions lead him to dismiss the traditional\nquestion of free will as absurd, but also raise new questions, such as\nwhether we are (or can be) free in respect of willing and whether we\nare free to will what we will, questions to which he gives divergent\nanswers. Locke also discusses the (much misunderstood) question of\nwhat determines the will, providing one answer to it at one time, and\nthen changing his mind upon consideration of some constructive\ncriticism proposed by his friend, William Molyneux. In conjunction\nwith this change of mind, Locke introduces a new doctrine (concerning\nthe ability to suspend the fulfillment of one\u2019s desires) that\nhas caused much consternation among his interpreters, in part because\nit threatens incoherence.  As we will see, Locke\u2019s initial views\ndo suffer from clear difficulties that are remedied by his later\nchange of mind, all without introducing incoherence. \n Note on the text: Locke\u2019s theory of freedom is contained in\nBook II, Chapter xxi of An Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding. The chapter underwent five revisions in\nLocke\u2019s lifetime [E1 (1689), E2 (1694), E3 (1695), E4 (1700),\nand E5 (1706)], with the last edition published posthumously.\nSignificant changes, including a considerable lengthening of the\nchapter, occur in E2; and important changes appear in E5.\n",
