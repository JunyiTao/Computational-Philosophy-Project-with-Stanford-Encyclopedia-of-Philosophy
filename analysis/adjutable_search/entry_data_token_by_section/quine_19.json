    "main_text": "Underdetermination of Theory by Evidence; Indeterminacy of Translation || Indeterminacy of Translation\n6.2 Indeterminacy of Translation\n\nThe general claim of the indeterminacy of translation is that there\nmight be different ways of translating a language which are equally\ncorrect but which are not mere stylistic variants. The claim includes\nwhat one might think of as the limiting case of translation, that in\nwhich a given language is \u2018translated\u2019 into itself.\n\nSome philosophers hold that the idea of indeterminacy is absurd, or\nthat it amounts to an extreme form of scepticism about whether we ever\nunderstand one another, or whether correct translation is possible at\nall. (See for example Searle, 1987; for a reply, see F\u00f8llesdal,\n1990.) It is not hard to see how such opinions arise. One picture of\ncommunication is like this: you have an idea, a determinate meaning,\nin your mind and convey it to me by your utterance. To those who have\nthat picture, indeterminacy threatens the whole idea of communication,\nfor it suggests that the conveying is always vulnerable to drastic\nfailure. In the case of translation, the analogous view is that\nsynonymy, or sameness of meaning, is the criterion of correct\ntranslation; in that case, indeterminacy may appear as a denial that\ntranslation is possible at all.\n\nSuch views, however, take for granted a view of communication, or of\ntranslation, which is very far from Quine\u2019s. For Quine, the\ncriterion of successful communication, whether or not it involves\ntranslation, is fluent interaction, verbal and nonverbal:\n\u201cSuccess in communication is judged by smoothness of\nconversation, by frequent predictability of verbal and nonverbal\nreactions, and by coherence and plausibility of native\ntestimony.\u201d (1990a, 43) This is a third person or external view\nof language and communication, as required by Quine\u2019s\nnaturalism. From this point of view, talk of synonymy and of ideas in\nthe mind is simply a theoretical gloss which is (at best) in need of\njustification. Quine doubts that the gloss is justifiable; scepticism\nabout the theorizing, however, is not scepticism about the data.\nSmooth communication certainly occurs, sometimes in cases where\ndifferent languages are involved. Quine says nothing that casts doubt\non the idea that successful translation (by his criterion) is\npossible; his claim, indeed, is that it may be possible in more than\none way.\n\nAt this point we need to distinguish two kinds of indeterminacy. Quine\nintroduces the general idea of indeterminacy, in Chapter Two of\n(1960), without explicitly distinguishing the two, but subsequently\ncomes to treat them quite differently. The first is indeterminacy\nof reference: some sentences can be translated in more than one\nway, and the various versions differ in the reference that they\nattribute to parts of the sentence, but not in the overall net import\nthat they attribute to the sentence as a whole. (Quine uses the terms\n\u201contological relativity\u201d and \u201cinscrutability of\nreference\u201d, as well as \u201cindeterminacy of reference\u201d.\nSome philosophers have sought to distinguish these doctrines, but in\nlater work Quine makes it clear that he uses the terms simply as\ndifferent names for the same thing. See Ricketts 2011, Roth, 1986, and\nQuine 1986d.) To use an example which has become famous, a given\nsentence might be translated as \u201cThere\u2019s a rabbit\u201d\nor as \u201cRabbithood is manifesting itself there\u201d or as\n\u201cThere are undetached rabbit parts\u201d, or in other ways\nlimited only by one\u2019s ingenuity. All that is needed is what\nQuine calls a proxy function, which maps each object onto another\nobject and each predicate onto one which is true of a given\nproxy-object if and only if the original predicate is true of the\noriginal object. For terms referring to physical objects, he suggests,\nwe can take the proxy-function to map each object onto its space-time\ncomplement. The change to the translation of singular terms and the\nchange to the translation of predicates cancel out, leaving the\noverall significance of the sentence unchanged. The claim of\nindeterminacy of reference is not in any way a claim about what goes\non in the language-user\u2019s mind (pace Wright 1997).\n(Note that it will not help to ask the person we are translating\nwhether she means to refer to the family dog or to its space-time\ncomplement: her answer is subject to the same indeterminacy.)\n\nIndeterminacy of reference is akin to a view of theoretical entities\nput forward by Ramsey: that there is no more to such an entity than\nthe role that it plays in the structure of the relevant theory (see\nRamsey, 1931). For Quine, however, the point holds for all objects,\nsince he \u201csee[s] all objects as theoretical\u2026. Even our\nmost primordial objects, bodies, are already theoretical\u201d (1981,\n20). Quine holds, moreover, that considerations akin to those of the\nprevious paragraph amount to a \u201ctrivial proof\u201d of\nindeterminacy of reference (1986c, 728).\n\nThe second kind of indeterminacy, which Quine sometimes refers to as\nholophrastic indeterminacy, is another matter. Here the claim\nis that there is more than one correct method of translating sentences\nwhere the two translations of a given sentence differ not merely in\nthe meanings attributed to the sub-sentential parts of speech but also\nin the net import of the whole sentence. (Hence the two translations\nwould express different propositions, in the abstract sense, or\ndifferent Fregean Gedanke; Quine claims that undermining\nthese ideas was part of his motivation in developing the doctrine; see\n1990d.) This claim involves the whole language, so there are no\nexamples, except perhaps of an exceedingly artificial kind. There is\nalso nothing resembling a proof; in some late works, indeed, Quine\nrefers to it as a \u201cconjecture\u201d (1986c, 728). At some\nearlier points, he seems to think that sufficiently clear-headed\nreflection on what goes into translation will suffice to make the idea\nat least plausible. All that can be required of a method of\ntranslation is that it enables us to get along with the speakers of\nthe other language: why should there not be more than one way\nto do it?\n\nArguments have been offered for holophrastic indeterminacy based on\nthe idea of underdetermination of theory by evidence (by Quine himself\nin his 1970) . Perhaps there is determinate translation of observation\nsentences, and thus of observation categoricals. Still, if each two\ndistinct theories is compatible with all observational truths, surely\nwe could plausibly attribute either theory to the speaker of the other\nlanguage. The weakness of this kind of argument is that translation\nmust presumably preserve more than links between sentences and\nstimulations, as captured by observation sentences; it must also\npreserve links among sentences, links which make it more or less\nlikely that a person who accepts a given sentence will also accept\nanother. Could there be methods of translation which preserved both\nkinds of links but nevertheless yielded different results?\nQuine\u2019s term \u201cconjecture\u201d seems apt.\n\nGiven the interpretation advanced in section 3, above, indeterminacy\nis not crucial for Quine\u2019s rejection of the sort of use that\nCarnap makes of the idea of analyticity. He has other arguments on\nthat score, as we saw. More generally, on the interpretation advanced\nhere, indeterminacy is not a crucial part of Quine\u2019s overall\nview. His coming to speak of it as conjectural, while not questioning\nother parts of his philosophy, suggests that he would accept this. If\nwe were sure that translation is determinate, we could perhaps use the\nidea to define a notion of synonymy. (Agnosticism here favours the\ncontrary position.) And, as Quine has indicated, we could then define\nthe meaning of an expression as the set of synonymous expressions.\nSuch a notion of meaning might make some difference. It might, for\nexample, provide a criterion of identity which enabled us to accept\nbeliefs as entities. It would not, however, play the most important\nroles in which philosophers have cast the idea of meaning. In\nparticular, it would not play a role in the explanation of how we\nunderstand our language, or of how communication between persons takes\nplace.\n",
