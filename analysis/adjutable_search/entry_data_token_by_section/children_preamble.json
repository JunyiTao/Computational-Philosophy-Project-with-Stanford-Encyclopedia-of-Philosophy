    "main_text": "\n\nIn the United States, philosophy typically makes its formal entry into\nthe curriculum at the college level. A growing number of high schools\noffer some introduction to philosophy, often in special literature\ncourses for college bound students. In Europe and many other\ncountries, it is much more common to find philosophy in the high\nschool curriculum. However, philosophy prior to high school seems\nrelatively uncommon around the world. This may suggest that serious\nphilosophical thinking is not for pre-adolescents. At least three\nreasons might be offered for accepting this view. First, philosophical\nthinking requires a level of cognitive development that, one may\nbelieve, is beyond the reach of most pre-adolescents. Second,\nespecially in the United States, the school curriculum is already\ncrowded; and introducing a subject like philosophy, it may be thought,\nwill distract students from what they need to learn. Third, given that\nphilosophical inquiry raises questions that more often than not resist\ndefinitive answers, it may encourage students to become skeptics\nrather than learners. However, as shall be seen, these reasons can be\nchallenged. \n",
