    "main_text": "Toward the Aufbau || Vienna and Wittgenstein\n2.4 Vienna and Wittgenstein\n\nAfter completing the Aufbau first draft in late 1925, along\nthese new lines, Carnap left for Vienna, where he became a lecturer\n[Privatdozent] and submitted the Aufbau manuscript\nto Moritz Schlick as his Habilitationsschrift. He immediately\nbecame an active participant in Schlick\u2019s weekly Circle, which\nwas embarking just then on yet another careful re-reading of\nWittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus. This group would soon (due to\nOtto Neurath\u2019s effective propaganda) become known to the world\nas the \u201cVienna Circle\u201d, the fount of a new\n(anti-)philosophy known as \u201clogical positivism\u201d\u2014a\nterm Carnap never liked.\n\nLike others in the Vienna Circle, Carnap saw the Tractatus as\na basis for solving the perennial problem of accommodating the truths\nof logic and mathematics to empiricism. Wittgenstein was no\nempiricist, but his characterization of logical truth as a pure\nartifact of representation, empty of empirical significance, gave the\nVienna Circle what they needed. Their logicism extended\nWittgenstein\u2019s truth-functional conception of logic to the whole\nof mathematics, and their empiricism interpreted Wittgenstein\u2019s\natomic sentences as sense perceptions, along the lines of the\nElementarerlebnisse at the basis of Carnap\u2019s\nAufbau. This version of Wittgenstein made mathematics\nconsistent with empiricism. However, its weaknesses were obvious even\nto the Circle: First, from the empiricist perspective of the Vienna\nCircle, Wittgenstein\u2019s truth-functional conception of logic\nseemed to require finitism; even the most abstract theories of physics\ncould then employ only restricted, finitary quantification rather than\nunrestricted quantification over a potentially infinite number of\nobservations ( Aufbau: \u00a7180; Carnap 1936\u201337:\n\u00a723). And second, Wittgenstein\u2019s exclusion of\n\u201celucidations\u201d (meta-sentences about the object sentences\nframed in the language of science) was not only paradoxical (it made\nall statement and discussion of logical principles meaningless) but\nseemed at odds with recent developments in the foundations of\nmathematics, especially Hilbert\u2019s metamathematics, and the\nbrilliant use made of this approach by Skolem, Tarski, and by one of\nCarnap\u2019s own students, Kurt G\u00f6del. (In turn,\nG\u00f6del\u2019s arithmetization of syntax and his incompleteness\ntheorems would have an enormous impact on Carnap\u2019s Logical\nSyntax of Language just a few years later\u2014see the\nsupplement on\n Logical Syntax of Language\n for more details.)\n\nCarnap set to work, after his arrival in Vienna, to solve these two\nproblems. He embarked on a major project to explore \u201cgeneral\naxiomatics\u201d, in which he sought to show that Hilbertian\naxiomatics could be accommodated within the Wittgensteinian\nrepresentational framework\u2014i.e., he sought to show that the\nHilbertian \u201cmethod of bifurcation\u201d (into metalanguage and\nobject language), while mathematically useful, could ultimately be\nreduced to a Wittgensteinian single language. The immediate goal was\nto prove a fundamental completeness theorem, purporting to show that a\nconsistent axiom system is categorical just in case it is decidable\n(Awodey & Carus 2001). After three years of concentrated work on\nthis project (a substantial manuscript of several hundred pages\nsurvives in Carnap\u2019s papers), Alfred Tarski convinced him that\nthis theorem was defective, and that Carnap\u2019s attempt to work\nwithin a single language failed to capture the metamathematical\nconcepts fully (but see Schiemer 2013). And late in 1930, G\u00f6del\nactually showed that an important special case of Carnap\u2019s\ntheorem was false: second-order arithmetic, though categorical, is not\ndecidable. This famous result put an end to Carnap\u2019s project of\nfusing Hilbert and Wittgenstein.\n",
