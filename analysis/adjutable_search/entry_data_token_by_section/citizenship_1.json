    "main_text": "Dimensions of citizenship || Two models of citizenship: republican and liberal\n1.2 Two models of citizenship: republican and liberal\n\nDiscussions about citizenship usually have, as their point of\nreference, one of two models: the republican or the liberal. The\nrepublican model\u2019s sources can be found in the writings of\nauthors like Aristotle, Tacitus, Cicero, Machiavelli, Harrington and\nRousseau, and in distinct historical experiences: from Athenian\ndemocracy and Republican Rome to the Italian city-states and\nworkers\u2019 councils.\n\nThe key principle of the republican model is civic self-rule, embodied\nin classical institutions and practices like the rotation of offices,\nunderpinning Aristotle\u2019s characterization of the citizen as one\ncapable of ruling and being ruled in turn. Citizens are, first and\nforemost, \u201cthose who share in the holding of office\u201d\n(Aristotle Politics, 1275a8). Civic self-rule is also at the\nheart of Rousseau\u2019s project in the Contrat Social: it\nis their co-authoring of the laws via the general will that makes\ncitizens free and laws\n legitimate.[3]\n Active participation in processes of deliberation and decision-making\nensures that individuals are citizens, not\n subjects.[4]\n In essence, the republican model emphasizes the second dimension of\ncitizenship, that of political agency.\n\nThe liberal model\u2019s origins are traceable to the Roman Empire\nand early-modern reflections on Roman law (Walzer 1989, 211). The\nEmpire\u2019s expansion resulted in citizenship rights being extended\nto conquered peoples, profoundly transforming the concept\u2019s\nmeaning. Citizenship meant being protected by the law rather than\nparticipating in its formulation or execution. It became an\n\u201cimportant but occasional identity, a legal status rather than a\nfact of everyday life\u201d (Walzer 1989, 215). The focus here is on\nthe first dimension: citizenship is primarily understood as a legal\nstatus rather than as a political office. It now \u201cdenotes\nmembership in a community of shared or common law, which may or may\nnot be identical with a territorial community\u201d (Pocock 1995,\n37). The Roman experience shows that the legal dimension of\ncitizenship is potentially inclusive and indefinitely extensible.\n\nThe liberal tradition, which developed from the 17th\ncentury onwards, understands citizenship primarily as a legal status:\npolitical liberty is important to protect individual freedoms from\ninterference by other individuals or the authorities themselves.\nCitizens exercise these freedoms primarily in the world of private\nassociations and attachments, rather than in the political domain.\n\nAt first glance, the two models offer a clear set of alternatives:\ncitizenship as a political office or a legal status; central to an\nindividual\u2019s sense of self or as an \u201coccasional\nidentity\u201d. The citizen appears either as the primary political\nagent or as an individual whose private activities leave little time\nor inclination to engage actively in politics, entrusting the business\nof law-making to representatives. If the liberal model of citizenship\ndominates contemporary constitutional democracies, the republican\ncritique of the private citizen\u2019s passivity and\ninsignificance is still alive and well.\n\nRepublicans have problems of their own. First and foremost is a\nconcern, often repeated since Benjamin Constant, that their ideal has\nbecome largely obsolete in the changed circumstances of the\n\u201cgrands \u00c9tats modernes\u201d (Constant 1819).\nAiming to realize the original republican ideal in the present context\nwould be a disaster, as was the Jacobins\u2019 attempt during the\nFrench revolution (Walzer 1989, 211). Today\u2019s citizens will not\nbe Romans: first, the scale and complexity of modern states seem to\npreclude the kind of civic engagement required by the republican\nmodel. If an individual\u2019s chances of having an impact as an\nactive citizen are close to nil, then it makes more sense for him to\ncommit himself to non-political activities, be they economic, social\nor familial. His identity as citizen is not central to his sense of\nself and politics is only one of his many interests (Constant 1819,\n316). Second, the heterogeneity of modern states does not allow the\nkind of \u201cmoral unity\u201d and mutual trust that has been\nprojected onto the ancient polis, qualities deemed necessary\nto the functioning of republican institutions (Walzer 1989, 214).\nHowever, if ancient virtue is irrecoverable, the republican model may\nstill act today as \u201ca benchmark that we appeal to when assessing\nhow well our institutions and practices are functioning\u201d (Miller\n2000, 84). In essence, this involves a reformulation of the model,\nquestioning some of its original premises while holding onto the ideal\nof the citizen as an active political agent.\n\nInstead of opposing the two models, we could reasonably see them as\ncomplementary. Political liberty, as Constant pointed out, is the\nnecessary guarantee of individual liberty. Echoing Constant, Michael\nWalzer considers that the two conceptions \u201cgo hand in\nhand\u201d since \u201cthe security provided by the authorities\ncannot just be enjoyed; it must itself be secured, and sometimes\nagainst the authorities themselves. The passive enjoyment of\ncitizenship requires, at least intermittently, the activist politics\nof citizens\u201d (Walzer 1989, 217). There are times when\nindividuals need only be \u201cprivate citizens\u201d and\nothers when they must become \u201cprivate citizens\u201d\n(Ackermann 1988). Can we expect passive spectators of political life\nto become active citizens should the need arise? This is no easy\nquestion and may explain why Constant ended his famous essay by\ninsisting that the regular exercise of political liberty is the surest\nmeans of moral improvement, opening citizens\u2019 minds and spirits\nto the public interest, and to the importance of defending their\nfreedoms. Such habituation underpins their capacity and willingness to\nprotect their liberties and the institutions that support them\n(Constant 1819,\n 327\u2013328).[5]\n",
