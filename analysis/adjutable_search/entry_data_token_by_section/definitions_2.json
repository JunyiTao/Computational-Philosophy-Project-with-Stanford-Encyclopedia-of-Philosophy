    "main_text": "Some varieties of definition || Dictionary definitions\n1.2 Dictionary definitions\n\nNominal definitions\u2014definitions that explain the meaning of a\nterm\u2014are not all of one kind. A dictionary explains the meaning\nof a term, in one sense of this phrase. Dictionaries aim to provide\ndefinitions that contain sufficient information to impart an\nunderstanding of the term. It is a fact about us language users that\nwe somehow come to understand and use a potential infinity of\nsentences containing a term once we are given a certain small amount\nof information about the term. Exactly how this happens is a large\nmystery. But it does happen, and dictionaries exploit the fact. Note\nthat dictionary entries are not unique. Different dictionaries can\ngive different bits of information and yet be equally effective in\nexplaining the meanings of terms.\n\nDefinitions sought by philosophers are not of the sort found in a\ndictionary. Frege\u2019s definition of number (1884) and Alfred\nTarski\u2019s definition of truth (1983, ch. 8) are not offered as\ncandidates for dictionary entries. When an epistemologist seeks a\ndefinition of \u201cknowledge,\u201d she is not seeking a good\ndictionary entry for the word \u2018know\u2019. The philosophical\nquest for definition can sometimes fruitfully be characterized as a\nsearch for an explanation of meaning. But the sense of\n\u2018explanation of meaning\u2019 here is very different from the\nsense in which a dictionary explains the meaning of a word.\n",
