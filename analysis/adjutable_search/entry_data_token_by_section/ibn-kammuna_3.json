    "main_text": "The Science of the Soul\n4. The Science of the Soul\nThe science of the soul (\u2018ilm al-nafs) is an important topic in all of Ibn\nKammuna\u2019s philosophical treatises.  In addition, he wrote three\nmonographs, two of which aim to prove that the soul is eternal, and a\nthird which refutes the claim that the soul is nothing but the\ntemperament or mixture of the bodily humours, as well as the view that\nthe soul comes into being along with the body.  (Pourjavady &\nSchmidtke 2006, 100\u2013106). His special interest in studying the soul\n(nafs) calls for explanation. Like so many other features of\nhis work, it can be understood only in the context of the Avicennan\nlegacy. Avicenna took his perception of his own self to be the most\ncertain piece of knowledge that he possessed. (It may be noted in\npassing that in Arabic, nafs means both \u201csoul\u201d\nand \u201cself\u201d; though Avicenna took care to be as precise as\npossible in his terminology, this double-entendre has an inevitable\npresence in Arabic psychological literature, especially in the wake of\nAvicenna). This approach is totally at odds with the Aristotelianism\nthat, in all of its flavors, was the foundation of Islamic\nphilosophies. Throughout his life Avicenna struggled with the complex\nof problems ensuing from his insight, especially in the realms of\npsychology and epistemology, without ever arriving at a satisfactory\nsolution. The conundrum reverberated in the work of the following\ngenerations.[1]\n\n\n\nIbn Kammuna took the Avicennan reformulation as his basic conception\nof the soul. In lengthier writings he would of course review the\nfaculties, properties, and so forth associated with the soul; but the\nfundamental notion was that of the individual\u2019s self-awareness. For\nexample, in the introduction to his essay On the Immortality of\nthe Soul, he writes \u201cThe (word) soul is a designation of\nthe essence of the individual, to which one refers when one employs\nthe pronoun \u2018I\u2019 in saying \u2018I have done thus and\nso\u2019, \u2018I have reached such and such\u2019\u201d\n[trans. Nemoy 1958, p. 86]. In his pietistic Brief words\n(Kalim\u0101t waj\u012bza, to be discussed at length later on in this\nessay), Ibn Kammuna complains that a full discussion of the soul\u2019s\nproperties, mode of binding to the body, and so forth, would be\n\u201clengthy\u201d; he is content to refers the reader \u201cto\nbooks by those who have preceded [us]\u201d. For his purposes,\n\u201cthe most important [point] that has been made, and the closest\nto comprehension\u2026is that the soul is that to which each one\nrefers when saying \u2018I\u2019, as in \u2018I perceived\u2019,\n\u2018I did this\u2019\u201d\u2026) (Schmidtke and Pourjavady 2007,\np. 151).\n\n\nNonetheless, Ibn Kammuna parted ways with Avicenna, and with the\nmainstream philosophical tradition, on the key issue of the soul\u2019s\npre-existence. Avicenna denied that the soul existed before the human\nwas born, but Ibn Kammuna held that the soul\u2019s pre-existence is\nintimately connected with its immateriality, and a doctrine that must\nbe accepted in order to prove the soul\u2019s survival after the death of\nthe body. And, indeed, as Lukas Muehlethaler has shown in a series of\npublications, Ibn Kammuna labored to shore up the demonstrations of\npsychological doctrines throughout. In his commentary to Avicenna\u2019s\nIsh\u0101r\u0101t (\u201cPointers\u201d), where the \u201cFlying Man\u201d\nthought experiment is displayed, Ibn Kammuna puts Avicenna\u2019s verbal\nargument into syllogistic form. (Whether the syllogism is productive,\nand, in general, just how well Ibn Kammuna has succeeded in answering\nthe modern critics of Avicenna, remain open questions; see Muhlethaler\n2009 for full discussion). Ibn Kammuna boldly claims to have\nformulated the first demonstrative proof for the soul\u2019s eternity a\nparte ante. Indeed, for Ibn Kammuna the soul is really an intellect (\u2018aql)\nthat is called \u201csoul\u201d when it is associated with a\nparticular body (Muehlethaler 2012).\n",
