    "main_text": "Retentional Approaches || Temporal Illusions and Neuroscience\n4.3 Temporal Illusions and Neuroscience\n\nIn a series of papers Rick Grush has developed a version of\nretentionalism in the form of the \u201ctrajectory estimation\nmodel\u201d (TEM) which draws on ideas and analyses from control\ntheory and signal processing\u2014for further details, see Grush\n(2005a, 2005b). So far as analogies with Husserl\u2019s doctrines are\nconcerned, a key point is that the internal models employed by these\nsystems are not confined to representing instantaneous states\nof the relevant domain. What is modelled, rather, is\nthe trajectory of the domain over a short interval of time,\ni.e., the entire succession of states that the system estimates that\ndomain is most likely to have been in during the relevant interval. It\nis this trajectory which Grush takes to be the information-processing\nanalogue of Husserl\u2019s tri-partite specious presents.\n\nGrush argues that the abilities of his systems to generate different\n(and incompatible) representations of what is being perceived at a\ngiven time is a positive boon, for it allows his theory to accommodate\na variety of temporal illusions. In so-called\n\u201cpost-dictive\u201d illusions what is experienced as seemingly\noccurring at a time t is influenced by stimuli arriving later\nthan t. One such illusion is the cutaneous rabbit\ndescribed by Geldard & Sherrick (1972). The experiment involved\ndevices capable of delivering controlled brief (2 msec) pulses to the\nskin being fitted along the arms of subjects. Surprisingly, when the\ndevices were clustered in just three tight configurations\u2014and\nthe wrist, the elbow and in-between\u2014and five pulses were\ndelivered to each location, rather than experiencing three tight\nclusters of pulses (one at the wrist, one at the elbow and one\nin-between) subjects report feeling a succession of evenly\nspaced pulses starting at the wrist and terminating a the elbow.\nThere are several questions that can be asked about this, but perhaps\nthe most puzzling is: what is happening at the time of the\nsecond pulse? How is the brain able to adopt the\n\u201cevenly spaced\u201d interpretation before the second\nflash even occurs?\n\nGrush\u2019s TEM has no difficulty explaining what is going on in\nsuch cases. In the case of the rabbit, the second pulse is initially\nexperienced as occurring at the wrist. But as the brain updates its\nmodels in the light of subsequent sensory information and its own\nexpectations as to the likely scenario confronting it, it alters its\nverdict and the second pulse is experienced as occurring further along\nthe arm, as part of an evenly spaced succession. When subjects are\nsubsequently queried as to what they experienced, it is the later\nexperiences which get reported\u2014the earlier ones are not\nremembered.\n\nProponents of competing approaches have defended different ways of\ninterpreting post-dictive illusions. Dainton (2008a: 381) argues that\ncases of this sort pose no problem for extensionalists:\n\n\nmight it not be that our visual systems take some time \u2026 before\nproducing experience in response to a given stimulus? And might they\nnot use this time to work out a single coherent\nversion of events before committing it to experience?\n\n\nEagleman and Sejnowski (2000) proposed a \u201cdelayed\nresponse\u201d construal of the flash-lag illusion along these lines.\nIn response Grush (2016: 5.1.1\n [Other Internet Resources])\n argues that since this additional delay will have to be incurred in\nall our perceptual systems all the time, positing it\nis by no means cost-free. Arstila (2016a) argues that Grush and\nDainton\u2019s explanations of post-dictive visual illusions are both\nproblematic, and proposes an\n alternative.[15]\n\nGeoff Lee (2014a, 2014b) defends what is arguably a retentional model\nof temporal experience, albeit one possessing some distinctive\nfeatures. Lee holds that specious presents are housed in experiential\nstates that have a very brief temporal extension\u2014Lee thinks\nthese states are identical with neural states and processes, and the\nlatter always have a non-zero temporal magnitude. Although these\nexperiences possess some temporal extension they do not have any\nexperiences as proper parts, and so Lee aptly calls them\n\u201catomic experiences\u201d. Extensionalists view specious\npresents as temporally extended experiences which do possess\nother experiences as proper parts, and for Lee this is the defining\nfeature of extensionalism. None of the seemingly-extended contents of\nLee\u2019s atomic experiences seem to be past- or\nmemory-like\u2014they are all fully perceptual in character\u2014and\nso different from Husserlian\n retentions.[16]\n\nOne of Lee\u2019s main arguments for preferring a version of the\nretentional (atomic) model is his \u201cTrace-Integration\nArgument\u201d, which has its roots in his preferred science-oriented\nmethodology. Lee points out a basic and widespread assumption in\nrecent cognitive psychology: information concerning what has been\nrecently perceived must be simultaneously present in subsequent\nrepresentations if it is to play any role in cognition (Lee 2014a:\n15). It does seem plausible to suppose that our brains engage in\ncoding of the sort Lee describes. What is more controversial is\nwhether this is the only kind of processing that our brains\nengage in when generating temporal experience. For a critical\nassessments of Lee\u2019s argument Viera (2019), and for very\ndifferent kind of neural models which rely on temporally extended\nneural processes see Northoff (2016), Northoff and Huang (2017), and\nPiper (2019).\n",
