    "main_text": "The Major Problems with Zermelo's System || Separation\n3.1  Separation\nThe problem with the Axiom of Separation is not with the\nobviousness of the principle; it seems straightforward to accept that\nif one has a set of objects, one can separate off a subclass of this\nset by specifying a property, and treat this in turn as a set. The\nquestion here is a subtler one, namely that of how to formulate this\nprinciple as an axiom. What means of \u2018separating off\u2019 are\nto be accepted? What are allowable as the properties? As a matter of\npractice, we use a language to state the properties, and in informal\nmathematics, this is a mixture of natural language and special\nmathematical language. The Richard Paradox (see Richard 1905 and also\nthe papers of Poincar\u00e9 1905, 1906a,b) makes it clear that one\nhas to be careful when defining properties, and that the unregulated\nuse of \u2018ordinary language\u2019 can lead to unexpected\ndifficulties.\nZermelo's answer to this, in moving from the system of the second\nwell-ordering paper to the axiomatisation, is to try specifying what\nproperties are to be allowed. He calls the properties to be allowed\n\u2018definite properties\u2019\n(\u2018Klassenaussagen\u2019 or \u2018propositional\nfunctions\u2019), and states:\n\nA question or assertion \ud835\udd08 is said to be\n\u201cdefinite\u201d if the fundamental relations of the domain, by\nmeans of the axioms and the universally valid laws of logic, determine\nwithout arbitrariness whether it holds or not. Likewise a\n\u201cpropositional function\u201d \ud835\udd08(x), in which the\nvariable term x ranges over all individuals of a\nclass \ud835\udd0e, is said to be \u201cdefinite\u201d if it is definite\nfor each single individual x of the class \ud835\udd0e. Thus the\nquestion whether\na \u03b5 b or not is always\ndefinite, as is the question whether M\n\u2286 N or not.\n\nZermelo asserts that this shows that paradoxes involving the\nnotions of definability (e.g., Richard's) or denotation (K\u00f6nig's)\nare avoided, implying that what is crucial is the restriction to the\n\u2018fundamental relations of the domain\u2019 (so, \u03b5,\n=).\nThe basic problem is that it is not explained by Zermelo what the\nprecise route is from the fundamental relations \u03b5 and = to a\ngiven \u2018definite property\u2019; it is this which gives rise to\na general doubt that the Separation Axiom is not, in fact, a safe\nreplacement for the comprehension principle (see Fraenkel 1927:\n104). This plays into the hands of those, who, like Poincar\u00e9,\nconsider adoption of the Separation Axiom as insufficiently radical in\nthe search for a solution to the paradoxes. Poincar\u00e9\nwrites:\n\nMr. Zermelo does not allow himself to consider the set of all the\nobjects which satisfy a certain condition because it seems to him that\nthis set is never closed; that it will always be possible to introduce\nnew objects. On the other hand, he has no scruple in speaking of the\nset of objects which are part of a certain Menge M and which\nalso satisfy a certain condition. It seems to him that one cannot\npossess a Menge without possessing at the same time all its\nelements. Among these elements, he will choose those which satisfy a\ngiven condition, and will be able to make this choice very calmly,\nwithout fear of being disturbed by the introduction of new and\nunforeseen elements, since he already has all these elements in his\nhands. By positing beforehand this Menge M, he has erected an\nenclosing wall which keeps out the intruders who could come from\nwithout. But he does not query whether there could be intruders from\nwithin whom he enclosed inside his wall. (Poincar\u00e9 1909: 477;\np. 59 of the English translation)\n\nHere, Poincar\u00e9 is referring indirectly to his view that the\nparadoxes are due to impredicative set formation, and this of course\nwill be still be possible even with the adoption of the Axiom of\nSeparation.\nThe problem of the lack of clarity in Zermelo's account was\naddressed by Weyl in 1910 (Weyl 1910; see especially p. 113) and then\nagain by Skolem in 1922 (Skolem 1923, p. 139 of the reprint). What\nWeyl and Skolem both proposed, in effect, is that the question of what\n\u2018definite properties\u2019 are can be solved by taking these to\nbe the properties expressed by 1-place predicate formulas in what we\nnow call first-order logic. In effect, we thus have a recursive\ndefinition which makes the definite properties completely transparent\nby giving each time the precise route from \u03b5, = to the\ndefinite property in question. This does not deal with all aspects of\nPoincar\u00e9's worry, but it does make it quite clear what definite\nproperties are, and it does also accord with Zermelo's view that the\nrelations =, \u03b5 are at root the only ones\nused.[32]\nFraenkel (1922 and later) took a different approach with a rather\ncomplicated direct axiomatisation of the notion of definite property,\nusing recursive generation from the basic properties giving a notion\nwhich appears to be a subset of the recursively defined first-order\nproperties.\nZermelo accepted none of these approaches, for two reasons. First,\nhe thought that the recursive definitions involved make direct use of\nthe notion of finite number (a fact pointed out by Weyl 1910), which\nit ought to be the business of set theory to explain, not to\npresuppose. Secondly, he became aware that using essentially a\nfirst-order notion condemns the axiomatic system to countable models,\nthe fundamental fact pointed out in Skolem (1923). His own approach\nwas, first, to give a different kind of axiomatisation (see Zermelo\n1929), and then to use (in Zermelo 1930) an essentially second-order\nnotion in characterising the axiom of\nseparation.[33]\n",
