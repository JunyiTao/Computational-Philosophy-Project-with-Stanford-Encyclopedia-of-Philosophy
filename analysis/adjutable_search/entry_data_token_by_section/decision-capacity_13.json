    "main_text": "Five Widely Accepted Assumptions (And a Sixth, More Controversial One) || Value Neutrality\n5.4 Value Neutrality\n\nWhat we here call \u201cthe value neutrality constraint\u201d is a\nbit more complex, but its significance makes it important to explain\nclearly. Value neutrality refers to the idea that we need to leave\nroom for patients to make unusual or unpopular choices (Craigie 2013a:\n1). People vary greatly in their values and so, even when confronted\nwith similar situations, make very different kinds of choices. If the\nfreedom to decide for oneself is to be meaningful, we need to ensure\nthat individuals are not deemed to lack decisional capacity to make a\nchoice simply because they are choosing something others disapprove\nof. The worry is real. In the not-too-distant medical past, doctors\noften did assume incapacity and would therefore refuse to honor\npatient wishes whenever a patient rejected what the doctor saw as\nbeneficial treatment (Culver, Ferrell, & Green 1980: 587). Thus it\nseems important to find a way to distinguish competent though unusual\nchoices from choices that are unusual because incompetent\n(because arrived at by flawed or inadequate mental processes).\n\nConsider the decision to accept death rather than a certain form of\ntreatment. The desire to die can, of course, be a sign of mental\nillness in certain cases and so possibly a sign of incapacity\n(though merely being mentally ill doesn\u2019t make someone\nincompetent: see\n \u00a75.5).\n But it would be hugely problematic to view all refusals of\nlife-sustaining treatment as indicative of either mental illness or\ndecisional incapacity (or both!). Some people refuse life-sustaining\ntransfusion of blood for doctrinal religious reasons (Charland 2001:\n137). Others may choose death as a preferable alternative to\nsuffering. For example, a long-term dialysis patient who is not a\ncandidate for transplant may accept death as the only way to escape\nfrom an existence she finds unbearable. Such a choice is intelligible\neven if it is not the choice most dialysis patients make. In both the\nreligious case and the dialysis case the choice appears to reflect\nvalues that are not shared by all people. Yet disagreements about\nvalues, troubling though they may be, are not generally thought to be\nindicative of any lack of mental ability. Since death can be chosen by\ncompetent individuals as well as incompetent ones, many theorists have\nargued that we must look to something other than simply what is\nchosen to distinguish competent choice from incompetent\nchoice.\n\nIt is usually assumed that the only way to satisfy the requirement of\nvalue neutrality is to draw a sharp distinction between process and\noutcome (Freedman 1981; Buchanan & Brock, 1989: 50\u201351;\nBanner 2013: 1). On this view, capacity has more to do with the nature\nof the process whereby one arrives at a decision, rather than the\ncontent or outcome of the actual decision itself.\n\nClosely associated with this approach is a particular picture of what\nit is for a decision to be rational. This is sometimes referred to as\n\u201cinternal\u201d rationality, because it makes rationality a\nmatter of the internal relations between beliefs, values and\nparticular choices. It could also be called \u201cinstrumental\nrationality plus\u201d. On this view, there must be internal\nconsistency among the beliefs and values relevant to the decision at\nhand. In addition, an individual must be able to prioritize among her\n(decision-relevant) ends, and continue to update this priority ranking\nas circumstances change and evolve. And it requires (this is the\ninstrumental part) being able to recognize which of the options\navailable will best serve her ends. So consider again refusal of\nlife-saving transfusion based on adherence to religious doctrine. It\ncan be argued that, in such a case, the subject is decisionally\ncapable to refuse the transfusion as long as the decision is rational\naccording to internal reasons that he recognizes as his own, i.e., his\nchoice (refusing transfusion/accepting death) best serves his\nends (adherence to God\u2019s commands as his religion interprets\nthese), even if others find the choice puzzling.\n\nHowever, there remain some theorists who insist that there are cases\nin which irrationality is also a matter of outcome, of what one\nchooses. They resist the idea that we should focus exclusively on\nprocess when assessing capacity because of worries about particular\nkinds of cases. Consider the example of a subject who refuses\nelectroconvulsive therapy for a severe depression that has not\nresponded to any other forms of treatment. The patient refuses because\nof a deep fear of the procedure, even though she consented to it and\nbenefited from it at one point in the past (Culver, Ferrell, &\nGreen 1980; Culver & Gert 2004). In this case, given how harmful\nthe subject\u2019s choice may ultimately be to her, the decision not\nto accept the treatment seems problematic and, according to Culver\n& Gert, ought to be challenged. However, in order to say that this\npatient is not capable of refusing this treatment, it seems that we\nwould be forced to abandon a restricted focus on process. For it is\nmost likely true that the process by which she reaches the\ndecision is beyond reproach from the standpoint of internal\nrationality. Her current fear of the therapy is so great that she\nwould rather die than undergo the treatment. Even if one thinks this\nis a re-prioritization of values brought on by her fear (which would\nbe hard to establish), it remains true that currently she is\nreaching a decision consistent with what she currently cares\nmost about. And that is all that is required by internal rationality.\nYet Culver & Gert think such a choice should be grounds for\ndeclaring the patient incompetent. They think such a choice is\nirrational in a broader sense than allowed by internal\nrationality.\n\nLike other theorists of capacity, Culver & Gert acknowledge the\nmoral importance of avoiding any approach to capacity assessment that\nresults in doctors being able to declare a patient incompetent\nwhenever a patient refuses a recommended treatment. But they think\nthere are ways to avoid this problem without recourse to the strong\npolicy of focusing exclusively on the processes leading up to a\ndecision. They suggest instead that we can appeal to a general notion\nof how \u201cmost reasonable people would judge\u201d.\n\nAlthough the problems raised by the ECT case are real, many theorists\nthink that the solution offered by Culver & Gert is deeply\nproblematic. Relying on what many people view as rational (in some\nbroad, non-internal sense of rational) or on what many people view as\n\u201ca significant harm\u201d will not offer sufficient protection\nfor competent adults with unusual values. If our goal is to ensure\nthat mentally intact individuals are free to pursue their own\nidiosyncratic and at times unpopular values, then we must avoid\nbuilding into our account of capacity any specific requirements on\nchoice. Culver & Gert may be right that their proposal would allow\nthem to handle religious cases properly, since many people these days\nrecognize the existence of religious diversity and the need to\ntolerate certain religiously motivated choices, particularly if those\nchoices primarily affect the subject making the choice. But it is not\nat all clear that their view could handle the dialysis case mentioned\nearlier. When precisely does the refusal of further life-saving\ntreatment make sense? How much suffering is too much? Deep continuing\ndisagreements about the proper answer to such questions suggests that\nit would not be safe to build any particular answer into our notion of\ncompetence. To do so is to risk allowing majority values to limit the\nfree choice of others in inappropriate ways by ruling too many people\nincompetent for the wrong reasons.\n\nThese days clinicians and others working in clinical settings take it\nas axiomatic that \n\n\nclinicians should not conclude that patients lack decision-making\ncapacity just because they make a decision contrary to medical advice.\n(Ganzini 2005: S101) \n\n\nMoreover, discussions of capacity assessment tend to assume (contra\nCulver & Gert) that the only safe way to avoid this problem (the\nproblem of equating disagreement with incapacity) is to focus\nexclusively on how patients reach a decision. So although\nphilosophers may still see issues to be explored further, for now the\nclinical realm views these issues as resolved. It is taken for granted\nthat the need to maintain value neutrality is real, and that\nthe way to do this is to adopt an exclusively process-oriented\napproach to capacity assessment.\n",
