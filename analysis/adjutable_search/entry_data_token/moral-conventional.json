Introduction\n\nStarting in the early 1950s, with the publication of R.M. Hare\u2019s\nThe Language of Morals (1952), a large philosophical\nliterature began to appear aimed at specifying the distinctive or\nessential characteristics of moral judgments and moral principles.\nParticipants in these discussions often said their goal was to provide\nand defend a definition of morality, and The Definition of\nMorality (Wallace & Walker 1970a) was the title of a valuable\ncollection of papers drawn from that literature that included essays\nby Elizabeth Anscombe, Philippa Foot, William Frankena, Alasdair\nMacIntyre, Peter Strawson, and a number of other well-known\nphilosophers. Another large literature, much of it quite technically\nsophisticated, was inspired by David Lewis\u2019s seminal volume,\nConvention, published in\n 1969.[1]\n But it is only much more recently that philosophers have focused on\nthe distinction between moral judgments and conventional judgments,\nand sought to use that distinction in arguments about a wide array of\nphilosophical topics, ranging from the plausibility of metaethical\ntheories to the moral responsibility of psychopaths.\n\nThe emergence of a philosophical literature analyzing and invoking\nwhat has become known as \u201cthe moral/conventional\ndistinction\u201d can be traced to a growing awareness, among\nphilosophers, of the enormously influential work of developmental\npsychologist Elliot Turiel and his many collaborators, most notably\nMelanie Killen, Larry Nucci, and Judith\n Smetana.[2]\n This group of researchers are often called \u201csocial domain\ntheorists\u201d. The sections 3 through 10 of this entry will focus\non debates, in both psychology and philosophy, about the existence,\nthe nature, and the importance of the moral/conventional distinction.\n Section 11\n will consider some of the ways in which the social domain\ntheorists\u2019 account of the moral/conventional distinction, and\nrelated ideas, have been used in philosophical discussions of a\nvariety of issues.\n\nThe literature on convention that emerged in the wake of Lewis\u2019s\nbook is rarely discussed in the work of Turiel and his collaborators\nand it plays almost no role in their\n thinking.[3]\n But the philosophical literature on the definition of morality did\nplay an important role in Turiel\u2019s thinking. So before\nconsidering social domain theory, it will be useful to recount a pair\nof relevant facts about that literature.\n2. Two Facts About The Literature on the Definition of Morality\n\nThe first fact concerns the goal that philosophers who contributed to\nthe definition of morality literature were trying to\n achieve.[4]\n That goal is best explained with the help of a crucial distinction.\nOften, when we ask whether a person\u2019s judgment is moral, what we\nwant to know is whether her judgment on some moral matter is\ntrue\u2014or something in that vicinity: correct, or valid,\nor justified, or wise. What we are asking, to use Frankena\u2019s\n(1967) useful terminology, is whether the judgment is moral as opposed\nto immoral. But one point on which these philosophers were\ncrystal clear is that moral truth is not what they were\ntrying to explain. Rather, borrowing again from Frankena, what they\nwere trying to do was to distinguish moral judgments and principles\nfrom non-moral judgments and principles. They wanted to know\nhow to determine whether a person\u2019s judgment was a moral\njudgment rather than some other kind of judgment\u2014prudential, or\nreligious, or aesthetic, or legal. Whether the judgment was true, or\nvalid, or justified was simply not their concern. When considering the\nwork of Turiel and his followers, it is particularly important to keep\nthis distinction in mind, because it sometimes seems that these\nauthors, and some of their critics, don\u2019t. After\noffering evidence putatively establishing that a particular judgment\nis moral rather than conventional (and thus that it is moral rather\nthan non-moral), authors will sometimes go on to write as\nthough they had established that the judgment is true (see,\nfor example, Nucci 2001: 104\u2013106).\n\nThe second fact that will play an important role in our discussion of\nsocial domain theory concerns the outcome of the philosophers\u2019\nattempts to find a definition of morality. After decades of effort by\ndozens of authors, including some of the most eminent philosophers\nwriting in the second half of the twentieth century, the project\nfailed to reach anything close to consensus. Disagreements persisted\non just about every issue of methodology and substance. One central\nmethodological issue was whether the goal of the endeavor was\ndescriptive, aimed at characterizing how the concept of\nmorality is actually used, or normative, aimed at specifying\nhow the concept of morality should be used. Frankena took the\nproject to be normative, and he claimed a number of prominent\nphilosophers, including Richard Brandt and G.H. von Wright, as allies.\nBut other eminent figures, including R.M. Hare, H.L.A. Hart, and Alan\nGewirth, took the project to be descriptive (Frankena 1967 [1970:\n149\u2013151]).\n\nIn this philosophical literature, there is a long list of features\nthat were argued to be necessary if a judgment or a rule is to count\nas moral. Perhaps the most widely discussed of these was Hare\u2019s\nproposal that moral rules must be \u201cuniversalizable\u201d. As\nHare unpacked the notion, it required that there be no names or\ndefinite descriptions in moral rules. Another widely discussed\nproposal, also due to Hare, was that moral rules are\n\u201cprescriptive\u201d. What this means is that the\n\u201caction-guiding force [of moral rules] derives from the fact\nthat they entail imperatives\u201d (Wallace & Walker 1970b: 9). A\nthird proposal was that if an action guiding principle is a moral\nprinciple for a person, then she must regard it as \u201coverriding\nor supremely important\u201d (Frankena 1967 [1970: 155]). \u201cIn\ncases of conflict between moral and nonmoral principles, the former\nare necessarily overriding\u201d (Taylor 1978: 44; for a similar\nproposal, see Cooper 1970: 95). Yet another frequently discussed\nnecessary condition was that moral rules are behavior guiding rules\nwhose violation is met with social sanctions, \u201cthe reproach of\none\u2019s neighbors\u201d (Cooper 1966 [1970: 73]) or something\nmore serious, like ostracism (Sprigge, 1964 [1970: 129 ff]). This was\nsometimes paired with the idea that moral transgressions are followed\nby the transgressor sanctioning himself with feelings of guilt or\nshame or disliking himself (Wallace & Walker 1970: 14; Sprigge\n1964 [1970: 130]). All of these proposals were \u201cformal\u201d in\nthe sense that they did not impose any constraints on the contents of\nmoral rules or moral judgments. And this is far from a complete list\nof the formal conditions that were proposed; there were many more\n(Frankena 1963 offers an extensive list, along with many\nreferences).\n\nThere was no shortage of critics of these formal conditions.\nWittgensteinians, who maintained that \u201cmoral\u201d was a family\nresemblance term, denied that there are any necessary\nconditions for the application of the term. MacIntyre (1957), inspired\nby Sartre, argued that many moral judgments were neither\nuniversalizable nor (in Hare\u2019s sense) prescriptive. Sprigge\n(1964) offered a quite different argument against universalizability,\nas did Winch (1965). And so it went. Nothing on the long list of\nformal conditions that were proposed achieved anything even close to\nconsensus in the philosophical literature on the definition of\nmorality.\n\nEven more controversial was the question of whether more substantive\nsocial requirements should be built into the definition of morality.\nFor example, Toulmin (1950) argued that a concern for the harmony of\nsociety is part of the meaning of \u201cmoral\u201d, and Baier (1958\n[1970: 199ff]) proposed that moral rules \u201cmust be for the good\nof everyone alike\u201d. On these substantive principles, too, it is\nclear that no agreement was reached.\n3. Turiel\u2019s Project\n\nElliot Turiel (1938\u2013) was a student of Lawrence Kohlberg\n(1927\u20131987), who was, in turn, influenced by the work of Jean\nPiaget (1896\u20131980). All three have done seminal work on moral\ndevelopment in children and adolescents, and all three share the view\nthat reasoning and reflection on one\u2019s own experience plays a\ncentral role in that process. This view, often called\n \u201cconstructivism\u201d,[5]\n is commonly contrasted with nativist accounts of moral development\nthat focus on the role of the child\u2019s innate endowment, and with\nsocial learning accounts that emphasize the process of acquiring moral\nprinciples from parents and other important people in the\nchild\u2019s environment (Killen & Smetana\n2015:\u00a0705\u2013709; Killen & Dahl 2018: 23\u201325).\n\nImportantly, Piaget and Kohlberg also shared the view that over the\ncourse of development, normative reasoning emerges in stages.\nAccording to both Piaget and Kohlberg, in the first stage of this\nprocess young children\u2019s view of morality is\n\u201cheteronomous\u201d\u2014it is a set of rules imposed and\nenforced by others\u2014and moral behavior is simply a matter of\ncomplying with rules set by adults. On Kohlberg\u2019s account,\nchildren from about two and a half years of age to about six judge\nthat certain behaviors are wrong because they know those behaviors are\nlikely to be punished, and their understanding of wrongness is, near\nenough, exhausted by the idea of punishment: wrong behavior is seen as\nsimply behavior that is typically punished. Later, as the child\nmatures, different normative rules come to be viewed in different\nways. As Turiel portrays it,\n\n\n[t]his theoretical perspective can be referred to as a\n\u201cdifferentiation\u201d model in that moral reasoning emerges\nthrough its differentiation from nonmoral processes: At lower\ndevelopmental levels convention and morality are presumed to be\nundifferentiated, while at higher levels the two are\ndifferentiated\u2026. (Turiel 1977:\n 78)[6]\n\n\nTuriel was skeptical of the differentiation model and the claim that\nthere is only one sort of normative cognition in young children. He\nwas convinced that moral cognition is distinct from cognition about\nsocial conventions, that the distinction is present quite early in\ndevelopment, and thus\n\n\nthat social convention and morality should not be treated as part of\nthe same conceptual and developmental package, but as distinct\ndomains. (Turiel 1977: 79)\n\n\nIn order to make the case for this claim, he had to show that children\nmake characteristically moral judgments about some transgressions, and\nthat their judgments about conventional transgressions were\nsystematically different. To do that, Turiel needed an empirical test\nthat would indicate whether a normative judgment made by an\nexperimental participant\u2014child or adult\u2014was a moral\njudgment or a judgment about a conventional matter. In constructing\nhis test, Turiel drew inspiration from the philosophical literature on\nthe definition of morality. He focused on several of the necessary\nconditions for moral judgments that philosophers had proposed and used\nthem to guide the construction of the test he needed.\n\nOne of these was universalizability. Though Hare had relied on a\nlinguistic account of universalizability, Turiel interpreted\nuniversalizability as a claim about how a specific moral judgment\nmight be generalized to situations involving other people, other\nplaces, and other times. \u201cMoral prescriptions\u201d, he tells\nus, \u201care universally applicable in that they apply to\neveryone in similar circumstances\u201d (Turiel 1983: 36; italics in\nthe original). So if a young participant in an experiment judges that\nit is wrong for a child in her own school to push someone off a swing,\nand if that judgment is a moral judgment, we would expect the\nparticipant to judge that it is wrong for a child who attends a\ndifferent school in another town or in another country to push someone\noff a swing in similar circumstances. We\u2019d also expect the\nparticipant to judge that the same action\u2014pushing a schoolmate\noff a swing\u2014would be wrong if it happened sometime in the past\nor if it were to happen sometime in the future in similar\ncircumstances.\n\nA second feature discussed in the philosophical literature that was\nadopted by Turiel was the \u201ccategoricalness\u201d of moral\njudgments. To motivate this feature of his test he quotes the\nphilosopher Alan Gewirth:\n\n\nJudgments of moral obligation are categorical in that what persons\nought to do sets requirements for them that they cannot rightly evade\nby consulting their own self-interested desires or variable opinions,\nideals, or institutional practices. (Gewirth 1978: 24, quoted in\nTuriel 1983: 35)\n\n\nSince institutional practices cannot alter moral obligations, we\nshould expect that if an experimental participant has judged that it\nis wrong to push someone off a schoolyard swing, and that judgment is\na moral judgment, then the participant would judge that it would be\nwrong in another school where there was no rule against pushing people\noff a swing, and it would be wrong even if the principal in her own\nschool said that there was no rule against it. In the jargon that has\ndeveloped in the literature growing out of Turiel\u2019s work, these\nquestions are said to probe for \u201cauthority independence\u201d.\nThe test that Turiel proposed to determine whether a judgment is a\nmoral judgment includes one or more questions assessing whether the\nparticipant takes her judgment to be universalizable and one or more\nquestions assessing whether she takes her judgment to be authority\nindependent. The examples used and the details of the questions asked\nvary with the age of the participant and the details of the\nparticipant\u2019s culture (Turiel 1989).\n\nBoth universalizability and categoricalness are\n\u201cformal\u201d\u2014they do not impose any constraints on the\ncontent of moral rules or moral judgments. But Turiel also held that\nthere are substantive features that moral judgments share. Moral\njudgments, he maintained, deal with issues linked to harm, justice or\nrights. Thus if an experimental participant has made a genuinely moral\njudgment and is asked to explain why the behavior in question is\nwrong, she will typically appeal to the harm that has been done, or to\ninjustice or the violation of someone\u2019s rights. Though Turiel\nfound inspiration for his focus on harm, justice, and rights in the\nphilosophical literature he\n favored,[7]\n his choice of these features was largely motivated by his\nconstructivist account of how children acquire moral beliefs. In\nsimple \u201cprototypical\u201d cases, he maintained, the child can\nsee that the behavior has harmful consequences, and that leads the\nchild to recognize that the behavior is wrong.\n\n\nChildren\u2019s moral judgments are \u2026 derived \u2026 from\nfeatures inherent to social relationships\u2014including experiences\ninvolving harm to persons, violations of rights, and conflicts of\ncompeting claims. (Turiel 1983: 3)\n\nIf, for example, one hits another, thereby causing physical harm, an\nindividual\u2019s perception of that event as a transgression stems\nfrom features intrinsic to the event (e.g., from a perception of the\nconsequences to the victim). (Turiel 1977: 80)\n\n\nSince the hypothesis that Turiel hoped to establish is that children\ndistinguish moral judgments from judgments about social convention, he\nalso needed an account of the distinctive features of judgments about\nsocial convention. Here too, he sought guidance in the philosophical\nliterature, though his palette was more limited. There are occasional\nreferences to Lewis\u2019s Convention, and to other authors,\nbut much of his discussion of convention relies on the work of his\nBerkeley colleague, John Searle (1969) (see, for example, Turiel 1983:\n37\u201338). Social conventions, on Turiel\u2019s account, are\ntypically local\u2014they differ in different places and at different\ntimes. So if a young participant judges that an action is wrong at her\nschool, and if she takes the action to be a transgression of a social\nconvention, then she will not insist that it would be wrong in other\nschools or at other times. Social conventions are also alterable,\nsince people or their leaders can decide to change them. Thus if a\nparticipant views a transgression to be a violation of a conventional\nrule, she will agree that it would not be wrong if an appropriate\nauthority were to change the rule. The function of social conventions,\naccording to Turiel, is to facilitate social coordination. So if asked\nwhy a transgression of a social convention is wrong, a participant\nwill typically focus on the factors that sustain social coordination\nand the consequences of disrupting it.\n\nWith these putative features of moral and conventional judgments in\nhand, Turiel proceeded to construct an empirical test to determine\nwhether an experimental participant\u2019s judgment about a\ntransgression is a moral judgment or a conventional\njudgment. The test begins with a brief vignette describing a\nhypothetical transgression. Since Turiel was interested in determining\nwhether young children could distinguish moral transgressions from\nconventional transgressions, the transgressions typically involve\nevents that would be familiar to kids. Participants are then asked a\nseries of questions aimed at determining whether they think the action\ndescribed is wrong, whether they think the wrongness of the action is\n\u201cauthority independent\u201d, and whether they would\nuniversalize the judgment, making the same judgment if the\ntransgression occurred at another place or time. These questions can\nbe asked in a variety of ways depending on the age of the participants\nand the goals of the study. In the jargon favored by Turiel and other\nsocial domain theorists, the responses to these questions are called\n\u201ccriterion judgments\u201d, and criterion judgments are crucial\nin determining whether the participant takes the transgression to be\nmoral or conventional. If the action is judged to be wrong, authority\nindependent, and generalizable, the participant is classified as\nhaving viewed the transgression as moral, while if it is judged to be\nwrong, authority dependent, and not generalizable, the participant is\nclassified as having taken the transgression to be conventional\n(Turiel 1983:\u00a052; Smetana\u00a01993:\u00a0115). Participants are\nalso asked to explain why the transgression is wrong, and responses\nare assessed to determine whether they invoke harm, justice or rights,\nor whether they invoke factors, like social coordination, tradition,\ncustom, appeal to authority, or the likelihood of punishment, that\nTuriel maintains are the sorts of justifications to be expected if\nparticipants view the transgression as conventional. Turiel calls\nthese responses \u201cjustification categories\u201d (Turiel 1983:\n52\u201353,\n 66\u201368).[8]\n\nFrom the mid-1970s through the mid-1980s, this experimental format was\nused in a large number of studies where the vignettes recounted events\nthat the experimenters took to be clear cases of moral transgressions\n(like unprovoked hitting, stealing, and destroying someone\nelse\u2019s property) or clear cases of conventional transgressions\n(like chewing gum in class, talking without raising one\u2019s hand,\nand calling the teacher by her first name), and the results,\noverwhelmingly, accord with Turiel\u2019s prediction. The\ntransgressions that the experimenters took to be moral were typically\njudged to be wrong, authority independent, and generalizable to other\nplaces and times, and judgments that the transgressions are wrong were\nusually justified by appeal to the harm the transgression had caused.\nThe transgressions that the experimenters took to be conventional were\ntypically judged to be wrong and authority dependent, they were not\ngeneralized to other times or places, and they were justified by\nappeal to social expectations, the need for social coordination, the\ncommands of people in authority, the threat of punishment, and similar\n factors.[9]\n Moreover, these distinctions emerged very early in development. By\ntheir fourth birthday, and often earlier, most children had\nsystematically different reactions to the sorts of transgressions that\nwere used. These results were an overwhelming victory for Turiel in\nhis disagreement with Kohlberg and Piaget. It is not the case\nthat young children think of all normative rules in the same way;\ntheir normative cognition is not \u201cundifferentiated\u201d.\nNormative cognition in young children is much more subtle, more\nvaried, and more complex than Kohlberg and Piaget had portrayed it.\nThis was a major achievement in the study of child development. But\nthe experimental results and the way they have been interpreted raise\na number of important philosophical and psychological questions.\nWe\u2019ll address these questions in the sections that follow.\n4. Does the \u201cMoral\u201d Pattern of Criterion Judgments Actually Identify Moral Judgments?\n\nIt is clear that studies eliciting criterion judgments and\njustification categories demonstrate that children respond quite\ndifferently to different sorts of normative transgressions. But why\nshould we think that in most or\n all[10]\n cases, when a participant judges that an action is wrong and then\noffers what Turiel and other social domain theorists take to be the\nmoral pattern of criterion judgments, that the participant\u2019s\njudgment that the action was wrong really was a moral\njudgment? The question is an important one for assessing\nTuriel\u2019s achievement. It\u2019s also important, as we will see\nin\n Section 10,\n because facts about Turiel-style criterion judgments and\njustification categories have been used to support claims about the\nnature of moral judgments and claims about the moral capacities of\nvarious groups of people, including children and psychopaths.\n\nIn formulating his account of criterion judgments indicating that a\nparticipant\u2019s normative judgment is a moral judgment,\nTuriel focused on three features\u2014authority independence,\nuniversalizability in space, and universalizability in time\u2014that\nhad been discussed by the philosophers who contributed to the\ndefinition of morality literature. But, as noted in\n Section 2,\n those philosophers reached no agreement about whether these features\nare necessary conditions for a judgment to count as moral. And Turiel\nmade no effort to advance or resolve the arguments found in the\nphilosophical literature. He contributed nothing to the descriptive\nproject of analyzing the ordinary concept of moral judgment. Nor did\nhe offer any normative arguments aimed at showing how our ordinary\nconcept of moral judgment should be revised. Rather, it seems, he\nsimply picked a cluster of disputed philosophical proposals, and\nclaimed that they could be used to identify genuinely moral judgments.\nSo what justification do we have for the claim that the criterion\njudgments Turiel uses actually do identify moral judgments? The\nproblem is nicely, though inadvertently, underscored by Judith Smetana\nin a passage describing work using the social domain theorists\u2019\nexperimental paradigm. \u201cChildren\u201d, she tell us,\n\n\nhave been asked to make judgments along a set of dimensions that are\nhypothesized to differentiate moral and conventional rules.\n(Smetana 1993: 114\u2013115; emphasis added)\n\n\nTuriel and other social domain theorists have indeed\nhypothesized that the criterion judgments they focus on\ndifferentiate moral judgments from conventional judgments. But it is\nfar from clear how they have defended that hypothesis. Can\nthe claim that these criterion judgments enable us to identify moral\njudgments be defended?\n5. The Natural Kind Defense\n\nOne possible defense was sketched by Kelly et al. (2007), and\ndeveloped in more detail by Kumar (2015, 2016) and Stich (2019). The\ncore idea is that the term \u201cmoral judgment\u201d can be viewed\nas a natural kind term. In his widely discussed paper, \u201cThe\nMeaning of \u2018Meaning\u2019\u201d, Hilary Putnam (1975) argued\nthat it is the job of empirical science to determine the essential\nfeatures of natural kinds like water and gold, and that these\nessential features can be used to specify the meaning of the term\ndenoting the kind. Devitt (1996) and Kornblith (1998), have provided\ninsightful accounts of how this process works. Very roughly, their\nstory goes like this. To begin, the scientist focuses on what seem to\nbe intuitively obvious examples of the kind in question. She seeks to\ndiscover properties that are shared by most of these intuitively\nobvious examples, and that are absent in most things that,\nintuitively, are not members of the kind. If this process leads to the\ndiscovery of a cluster of properties that is present in most intuitive\nexamples and absent in most cases that, intuitively, are not members\nof the kind, the scientist then hypothesizes that this cluster of\nproperties are nomologically linked and that they are the essential\nfeatures of the kind.\n\nKelly and colleagues suggested that this idea might be useful in\ninterpreting Turiel\u2019s work. On this interpretation, the ordinary\nterm \u201cmoral judgment\u201d is hypothesized to be a\npsychological natural kind term, and it is the job of psychology to\ndetermine the essential features of the psychological natural kind\nthat the term denotes. The obvious way to do this would be for\npsychologists to discover a cluster of nomologically linked properties\nthat are shared by most instances of what they take to be intuitively\nclear cases of moral judgments, one or more of which is missing in\nmost cases of judgments that they intuitively take not to be\nmoral judgments. This, Kelly and colleagues suggested, looks to be\nexactly what Turiel and his colleagues have done. Turiel and other\nsocial domain theorists take some of the transgressions they use in\ntheir experiments to be intuitively obvious cases of moral\ntransgressions, and these are judged, by most participants, young and\nold, to be authority independent, and generalizable to different\nlocations and to different times. The experimenters take other\ntransgressions to be intuitively obvious cases of conventional\ntransgressions, and these are judged, by most participants, to be\nauthority dependent and not generalizable to different locations or to\ndifferent times. If all of that is true, then\u2014for the reasons\nset out by Putnam, Devitt, and Kornblith\u2014Turiel and his\ncolleagues can plausibly claim to have shown that both moral judgments\nand conventional judgments are indeed psychological natural kinds, and\nto have discovered the essential features of those kinds. And that\nwould provide an excellent reason to think that the pattern of\ncriterion judgments that is hypothesized to identify moral judgments\nactually does identify moral judgments, and that the pattern of\ncriterion judgments that is hypothesized to identify conventional\njudgments actually does identify conventional judgments.\n\nFor this natural kind defense to work it must, of course, be the case\nthat the features that are used to identify moral and conventional\njudgments actually do form nomological clusters, and that most\nintuitive cases of moral judgment evoke the moral pattern of criterion\njudgments while most intuitive cases of conventional judgment evoke\nthe conventional pattern of criterion judgments. Do the empirical\nfindings support the natural kind defense? There is a large literature\nindicating that they do. The pattern of criterion judgments that the\nnatural kind defense requires has been found in studies with\nparticipants ranging in age from toddlers to adults (Nucci &\nTuriel 1978; Smetana 1981; Nucci & Nucci 1982). It has also been\nfound in participants of a number of different nationalities and\nreligions (for reviews see Tisak 1995; Smetana 1993; Nucci 2001) and\nin children with a variety of developmental disorders, including\nautism (Blair 1996; Blair, Monson, & Frederickson 2001; Nucci\n& Herman 1982; Smetana, Kelly, & Twentyman 1984; Smetana,\nToth, et al. 1999). There have been a few studies that did not fit the\nexpected pattern, notably Nucci and Turiel (1993) who found that\northodox Jewish children judged that a variety of intuitively\nnon-moral religious norm transgressions were authority independent\nthough they were not generalizable, and Nichols (2002) who found that\nAmerican college students judged that an intuitively conventional\netiquette transgression was authority independent though not\ngeneralizable. But as Kumar notes, the nomological clustering that the\nnatural kind defense requires \u201cis not supposed to be\nexceptionless\u201d (Kumar 2015: \u00a75; 2016: \u00a73.2).\n\nHowever, in almost all of the studies cited in the previous paragraph,\nthe intuitively moral transgressions used were the sorts of behavior\nthat would be familiar to children. Kelly et al. (2007) dub them\n\u201cschoolyard\u201d transgressions. This was also the case in\nBlair\u2019s (1995) study in which the experimental participants\nincluded incarcerated psychopathic murderers! In a pair of more recent\nstudies Kelly et al. (2007) and Fessler, Barrett, et al. (2015) used a\nrange of more \u201cgrown-up\u201d intuitively moral transgressions\nincluding whipping, slavery, stealing, wife beating and rape. Both\nstudies found fairly dramatic departures from the pattern of criterion\njudgments that the natural kind defense requires.\n [11]\n Stich (2019) argues that these studies pose a major challenge to the\nnatural kind defense of the claim that Turiel\u2019s\n\u201cmoral\u201d pattern of criterion judgments can be used to\nidentify genuine moral judgments. But both the methods and the\nanalyses used in the Kelly et al. and the Fessler et al. studies have\nbeen challenged, and these critiques have led to lively\n debates.[12]\n So perhaps the best conclusion to be drawn at this writing is that\nthe success of the natural kind defense is very much an open\nquestion.\n6. The Definition of Morality\n\nThe argument set out in the previous section suggests that\n\u201cmoral judgment\u201d can be viewed as a psychological natural\nkind term, and the essential features of moral judgments are that the\nperson making them takes them to be authority independent and\ngeneralizable to other times and other places. On the view urged by\nPutnam, Devitt, and Kornblith, these three features enable us to\nprovide a scientifically justified definition of \u201cmoral\njudgment\u201d. But while Turiel and his collaborators employ these\nfeatures as \u201ccriterion judgments\u201d used to determine\nwhether a participant\u2019s normative judgment is a moral judgment,\nthey do not treat them as providing a definition of\n\u201cmoral judgment\u201d. This is not because the social domain\ntheorists are uninterested in definitions. Quite the opposite! Many of\ntheir publications include discussions of \u201cthe definition of\nmorality\u201d (or of \u201cthe moral domain\u201d). Those\ndiscussions often acknowledge the influence of philosophical accounts\nof morality, and some of them discuss philosophical literature in\nconsiderable detail. Indeed, according to Turiel and Davidson,\n\n\nmore than any other discipline, philosophy has provided a basis for\ndefinitional criteria \u2026, [and] the working definitions guiding\nour research on concepts of convention and moral judgments \u2026\nborrowed liberally from some of those philosophical\ntreatments\u2026. (1986: 118)\n\n\nHowever, these definitions of morality, which have evolved somewhat\nover time, can be rather puzzling. It is often less than clear what\nthe definitions are, what their status is, how they are to be\nevaluated, and what role they play in the research of social domain\ntheorists. What is clear is that the definitions have provoked a great\ndeal of controversy. Some of the most trenchant and empirically\nsophisticated critiques of Turiel\u2019s work have focused on his\ndefinitions of morality. The primary goal of this section is to offer\nan account of the ways in which claims about the definition of\nmorality interact with other aspects of the work of Turiel and his\ncolleagues. The two sections that follow will consider some of the\nmore influential critiques of Turiel\u2019s definition.\n\nLet\u2019s start with a few examples. In Turiel (1977: 80) we are\ntold: \u201cThe distinction between convention and morality implies a\nnarrow definition of morality as justice\u201d. Much the same idea\nappears in Nucci and Turiel (1978). After maintaining that\n\u201csocial conventions are defined relative to the social\ncontext\u201d, they go on to say that \u201cmoral issues are\n\u2026 structured by underlying concepts of justice\u201d (1978:\n400\u2013401). But later in that paper, they describe their study in\nwhich \u201cevents classified as moral involved the justice, welfare,\nor rights of individuals or groups\u201d (1978: 402). This\nanticipates the formulation used in a frequently quoted passage at the\nbeginning of Turiel\u2019s The Development of Social\nKnowledge (1983), where we\u2019re told that\n\n\nthe moral domain refers to prescriptive judgments of justice, rights\nand welfare pertaining to how people ought to relate to each other.\n(1983:\n 3)[13]\n\n\nSocial domain theorists often characterize diminishing someone\u2019s\n\u201cwelfare\u201d as causing \u201charm\u201d, and in many\nplaces the term \u201charm\u201d replaces \u201cwelfare\u201d in\ntheir\n definition.[14]\n This is particularly important because in the vast majority of\nstudies by Turiel and other social domain theorists the transgressions\nthat they take to be moral result in obvious harm to the victim, and\nas we\u2019ll see in the following sections, the role of harm in\ncharacterizing moral transgressions has become a central focus in the\nliterature. In some recent publications by social domain theorists,\nfairness and equality have been added to the\n definition.[15]\n\nWhat is the status of these evolving definitions? One obvious proposal\nis that they are simply terminological stipulations intended\nto inform the reader about how these authors have decided to use the\nterm \u201cmorality\u201d. But that\u2019s clearly not what\u2019s\nintended, since Shweder, Turiel, and Much (1981: 289) insist that\n\u201c[t]he meaning of \u2018morality\u2019 is something\ndiscovered, not stipulated\u201d. Another possibility is that the\ndefinitions are attempts to capture the ordinary meaning of the term\nas it is used by speakers of contemporary English. But that proposal\nis also clearly mistaken. \u201cThe terminology\u201d, Turiel tells\nus,\n\n\ndoes not necessarily correspond to general, nonsocial scientific usage\nof the labels \u201cconvention\u201d and \u201cmorality\u201d.\nClear or systematic patterns of general use of the labels would be\ndifficult to discern. As labels, the terms are often used\ninterchangeably or even inconsistently; sometimes they correspond to\nthe definitions provided here and sometimes they are inconsistent with\nthem. (Turiel 1983: 34)\n\n\nIn trying to understand the status of these definitions, one useful\nhint is that Turiel and his associates often talk about\nimproving or refining them (see, for example, Killen\n& Smetana 2008: 4). In Turiel, Killen, and Helwig (1987: 169)\nwe\u2019re told that\n\n\n[t]he general strategy has been a recursive one: using definitions of\ndomain to inform data-gathering procedures and data to inform the\ndescriptions insofar as they apply to individuals\u2019 judgments. As\nstressed elsewhere (Turiel & Davidson 1986), these procedures must\nbe regarded as efforts based on working hypotheses, since the range\nand boundaries of domains are still not precise. The working\ndefinitions for the domains have also been partly guided by\nphilosophical treatments\u2026.\n\n\nAnd in Turiel and Davidson (1986), the strategy is further elaborated\nas follows:\n\n\nThe formation of systems for classifying domains of knowledge is both\na definition and a research issue in that definitions and data\ninterpretations feed back on each other. Our strategy has been one of\nmoving from (a) initial domain identification and definitional\ncriteria\u2026, to (b) the gathering of data bearing on how subjects\nuse and distinguish the categories, to (c) reformulations of the\ncategories and criteria\u2014and so on. (1986: 114)\n\n\nThese passages suggest the following account of the role and\njustification of definitions of morality in the work of Turiel and his\ncollaborators, and of the way philosophy contributed to their project.\nAs noted in\n Section 3,\n the philosophical literature played a role in designing the initial\nexperiments that enabled Turiel to show that children distinguish\ndifferent sorts of normative transgressions and thus that their\nnormative judgments are not \u201cundifferentiated\u201d. The\nfeatures probed by criterion judgment questions\u2014authority\nindependence and generalization to other places and other\ntimes\u2014were suggested by the philosophical literature. Having\nshown that a modest number of schoolyard transgressions that seem,\nintuitively, to be moral evoke the (putatively) moral pattern of\ncriterion judgments, a natural question to ask was how to characterize\nthe full set of transgressions that would evoke moral criterion\njudgments. Characterizing that set of transgressions would constitute\na \u201cdefinition of morality\u201d. Here again philosophy played a\nrole by suggesting what Turiel, Killen, and Helwig (1987) characterize\nas their \u201cworking definitions\u201d of the moral domain. Using\nsuch a working definition, Turiel and his colleagues could fine tune\nthe transgression descriptions and criterion judgment questions used\nin their experiments. And sometimes the results of the experiments\nrequired modification of the working definition of morality, which\nexpanded from matters involving justice, to justice,\nrights, and welfare or harm, and then expanded again to include\nmatters involving fairness and equality. This back\nand forth between definitions and data-gathering procedures is the\n\u201crecursive\u201d strategy that Turiel, Killen, and Helwig\n(1987) were alluding to.\n7. Empirical Challenges to Turiel\u2019s Definition of Morality: Does It Fail in Other Cultures?\n\nThe definition of morality proposed by Turiel and his associates is an\nempirical hypothesis about the sorts of transgressions that will evoke\nmoral criterion judgments. And while the hypothesis has evolved over\nthe last four decades, a core feature of work in the Turiel tradition\nis that harm plays a central role. Most of the experiments designed to\nexplore the boundaries of the moral domain include transgressions that\ncause obvious harm, and it is predicted, almost always correctly, that\nthese will lead participants to make moral criterion judgments. It is\nalso predicted that transgressions that do not cause obvious harm, and\nthat are not obvious examples of injustice or the violation of\nrights\u2014or, more recently, of unfairness or of treating people\nunequally\u2014will not evoke moral criterion judgments, and\nthus that people do not treat them as moral transgressions. But this\nsecond prediction has been the focus of a widely discussed empirical\ncritique of Turiel\u2019s definition of morality. The critics\u2019\ncentral contention, in Jonathan Haidt\u2019s memorable phrase, is\nthat Turiel\u2019s definition of morality \u201cdoes not travel\nwell\u201d (Haidt 2012: 22).\n\nThe first influential challenge along these lines was mounted by\nRichard Shweder and colleagues who argued that the sort of normative\njudgments that Turiel would classify as conventional play a much\nsmaller role in many non-Western societies, and that in those\nsocieties the moral domain\u2014the class of transgressions that\nTuriel\u2019s test or something in that vicinity would classify as\nmoral\u2014includes a wide range of actions in which no one is\nharmed, no injustice is done, and no rights are violated.\n\nMuch of the evidence Shweder offered for this claim came from an\nextensive study of the normative judgments of orthodox Hindus in India\nand of Christians and Jews in the USA (Shweder, Mahapatra, &\nMiller 1987). The Indian participants lived in a residential community\nsurrounding an eleventh and twelfth century Hindu temple in the city\nof Bhubaneswar. The Americans were recruited from a middle class\nneighborhood near the University of Chicago. The study collected\njudgments about a wide range of normatively regulated practices\nincluding\n\n\nforms of address\u2026, sleeping arrangements, incest avoidance,\ndietary practices, forms of dress, \u2026 begging, nepotism,\nmonogamy, wife beating, \u2026 the protection of persons from\nphysical and psychological harm, funeral rites \u2026. (1987: 4)\n\n\nA major goal of the study was to test Turiel\u2019s hypothesis that\ntransgressions that did not involve harm or other elements included in\nTuriel\u2019s definition of morality would be judged to be\nconventional rather than moral using questions similar to\nTuriel\u2019s criterion judgment questions. Participants were\npresented with a variety of brief vignettes, including these:\n\nWhile walking, a man saw a dog sleeping on the road. He walked up\nto it and kicked it.\nThe day after his father\u2019s death, the eldest son had a\nhaircut and ate chicken.\nA widow in your community eats fish two or three times a\nweek.\n\n\nNot surprisingly, both the Indian and the American participants judged\nthe behavior described in (1) to be wrong, and using the questions\nthat Schweder and colleagues constructed to determine whether\nparticipants regarded a judgment to be moral or conventional, both\ngroups regarded (1) to be a moral transgression. That, of course, is\nwhat Turiel would predict. But the responses to (2) and (3) appeared\nto be much more problematic for Turiel. Though the American\nparticipants did not judge them to be wrong at all, the Indian\nparticipants judged them to be quite serious transgressions, and their\nresponses to questions designed to determine whether they viewed the\ntransgressions as moral or conventional indicated that they viewed\nthem as moral. Since neither the son\u2019s behavior in (2) nor the\nwidow\u2019s behavior in (3) does any obvious harm, commits no\nobvious injustice, and seems to violate no one\u2019s rights, Shweder\nand colleagues argued that these responses, along with the Indian\nparticipants\u2019 responses about many of the other vignettes, posed\na major challenge for Turiel. The class of transgressions treated as\nmoral by the Indian participants was much larger than Turiel\u2019s\ndefinition of morality predicted, and the class of conventional\ntransgressions was vanishingly small.\n\nTuriel was not convinced. In a lengthy response, Turiel, Killen, and\nHelwig (1987) argued that Shweder\u2019s putatively troubling\nexamples relied on profound differences between the non-moral beliefs\nof Shweder\u2019s Indian and American participants. For the\nAmericans, getting a haircut, eating chicken, and eating fish are all\nentirely harmless, so it is no surprise that they judged the\nson\u2019s behavior and the widow\u2019s to be unproblematic. But,\nas Shweder himself had noted in an earlier paper, the Indians believed\nthat if a son were to eat chicken the day after his father\u2019s\ndeath, it would result in his father\u2019s soul not receiving\nsalvation (Shweder & Miller 1985: 48). They also believed that\nfish is a \u201chot\u201d food that would stimulate the\nwidow\u2019s sexual appetite and might lead her to have sex, which\nwould offend her husband\u2019s spirit and lead to great suffering\n(Turiel, Killen, &\u00a0Helwig 1987: 209). The Indian participants\nclassified more transgressions as moral, Turiel and colleagues argued,\nnot because they have a more inclusive definition of morality, but\nrather because they believed many more actions to be harmful.\n\nThis response led Jonathan Haidt to design a study in which he\nexplored people\u2019s reactions to what he characterized as\n\u201charmless taboo violations\u201d, (Haidt 2012: 19). Several of\nthese, including the two below, were, and were intended to be, rather\nshocking:\n\nDog: A family\u2019s dog was killed by a car\nin front of their house. They had heard that dog meat was delicious,\nso they cut up the dog\u2019s body and cooked it and ate it for\ndinner.\nKissing: A brother and sister like to kiss\neach other on the mouth. When nobody is around, they find a secret\nhiding place and kiss each other on the mouth, passionately.\n\n\nAnother vignette that Haidt used has become quite famous:\n\nChicken: A man goes to the supermarket\nonce a week and buys a dead chicken. But before cooking the chicken,\nhe has sexual intercourse with it. Then he cooks it and eats it.\n(Haidt, Koller, & Dias 1993: 617)\n\n\nAfter each vignette, rather than simply assuming that participants\nbelieved the actions described to be harmless, Haidt asked, \u201cIs\nanyone hurt by what [the actor] did? Who? How?\u201d (Haidt, Koller,\n& Dias 1993: 617).\n\nSince Haidt was interested in Shweder\u2019s claim that the moral\ndomain was much larger for people in non-Western societies, his study\nwas designed to compare the judgments of participants near his own\nuniversity, in Philadelphia, with those of participants in two\nBrazilian cities\u2014Porto Alegre, in the south, which was\nindustrialized, westernized, and relatively wealthy, and Recife, in\nthe north, which was much poorer, less industrialized, and less\nwesternized. As Shweder would have predicted, Haidt found that\nparticipants in Recife were more likely than participants in\nPhiladelphia to view behaviors like those in\n Dog,\n Kissing, and\n Chicken\n as moral transgressions, using Haidt\u2019s version of the questions\nintended to determine whether a participant regarded a transgression\nas moral or conventional. Participants in Porto Alegre were in between\nthe two. But there was also a surprise in the data. Haidt and\ncolleagues had collected information about the socio-economic status\n(SES) of their participants, and they found that lower SES groups\n\u201cmoralized\u201d more than higher SES groups in all three\ncities, and that the effect of SES was much larger than the effect of\nlocation.\n\nHaidt\u2019s study posed an important and influential challenge to\nTuriel\u2019s harm-anchored definition of morality. But it was not\nwithout problems. In constructing the questions they would use to\ndetermine whether participants regarded a judgment to be moral or\nconventional, Shweder and colleagues had included a question about\npunishment:\n\n\nDo you think a person who does (the practice under\nconsideration) should be stopped from doing that or punished in\nsome way? (Shweder, Mahapatra, & Miller 1987: 42)\n\n\nAnd Haidt retained a version of the punishment question in his study:\n\u201cShould [the actor] be stopped or punished in any way?\u201d\n(Haidt, Koller, & Dias 1993: 617). However, though Turiel and his\ncolleagues sometimes collect judgments about punishment, they\nexplicitly reject their use in assessing whether participants view a\ntransgression as moral or conventional, since both moral and\nconventional transgressions are often punished. Smetana, Rote, et al.\n(2012: 683) insist that judgments about punishment \u201care not a\nformal criterion for differentiating the domains\u201d. And Smetana,\nJambon, and Ball (2018) tell us that while they\n\n\ncommonly assess children\u2019s judgments of \u2026 the degree of\ncensure that the transgressor deserves,\u2026. these evaluations are\nless informative than criterion judgments because all rule violations\nare, by definition, unacceptable, wrong, and punishable. (2018:\n270)\n\n\nThe other question Haidt asked in his pared down version of queries\nintended to determine whether participants regarded a judgment as\nmoral was aimed at assessing whether participants generalized their\njudgment:\n\n\nSuppose you learn about two different foreign countries. In country A\npeople [do that act] very often, and in country B, they never [do that\nact]. Are both of these customs OK, or is one of them bad or wrong?\n(Haidt, Koller, & Dias 1993: 617)\n\n\nSince Turiel\u2019s version of the criterion judgment questions also\nincludes one or more questions aimed at determining whether\nparticipants view their judgment to be authority dependent or\nauthority independent, it is not clear that Haidt\u2019s two probes\n(or the questions that Shweder used) constitute a fair test of the\nhypothesis that the transgressions evoking the moral pattern of\ncriterion judgments all involve harm.\n\nDuring the last three decades, there have been a number of studies\nthat cleaved more closely to the authority independence and\ngeneralization criterion judgments advocated by Turiel and his\nassociates and explored the sorts of transgressions that evoked those\njudgments in a variety of religions groups and a variety of cultural\n settings.[16]\n Most of the studies undertaken by Turiel and researchers associated\nwith him used intuitive moral transgressions that seemed (to\ncontemporary Western observers) to be obviously harmful, and intuitive\nconventional transgressions that seemed (again, to contemporary\nWestern observers) to obviously not be harmful. These studies confirm\nthe prediction that transgressions that evoke moral criterion\njudgments are harmful and transgressions that don\u2019t evoke moral\ncriterion judgments aren\u2019t. But none of these studies are\nproblem free. None of them follow Haidt\u2019s lead and actually\nask participants whether the transgressive behavior is\nharmful. Also most of the transgressions used in these studies are of\nthe tame \u201cschoolyard\u201d variety that can be comfortably used\nwith children. None of these studies used anything like the more\nflamboyant \u201charmless taboo violations\u201d that were center\nstage in Haidt\u2019s study. So we do not know whether people in\nthese cultures and religious groups would offer moral or conventional\ncriterion judgments in response to transgressions like the ones that\nHaidt used.\n\nBy contrast, two recent studies by Berni\u016bnas and his colleagues\n(2016, 2020) did use Haidt-style transgressions, including eating a\npet dog who has been run over, using the national flag to clean the\ntoilet, and defecating in a Buddhist temple. They also followed Haidt\nin explicitly asking whether anyone was harmed by these actions. But,\nunlike Haidt, they solicited Turiel-style criterion judgments using\nquestions that cleaved quite closely to those used by Turiel and other\nsocial domain theorists. They found that many of the transgressions\nthat the participants themselves characterized as harmless evinced\nmoral rather than conventional criterion\njudgments.\n\nOverall, the bottom line is that on the question of whether\nTuriel\u2019s hypothesis about the definition of morality applies\ncross-culturally, the jury is still out. Many of the earlier studies\nconfront serious methodological issues. And while the two recent\nstudies, by Berni\u016bnas and colleagues, that avoid earlier\nmethodological problems report findings that challenge Turiel\u2019s\ndefinition, much more methodologically fastidious research is\nneeded.\n8. Empirical Challenges to Turiel\u2019s Definition of Morality: Does it Fail with \u201cNon-Prototypical\u201d Transgressions?\n\nThus far our focus has been on work that sought to test\nShweder\u2019s contention that Turiel\u2019s definition of morality\nwould not travel well because people in other cultures would offer\nmoral-pattern criterion judgments about transgressions that do not\ninvolve harm or justice or rights. But Haidt\u2019s analysis of the\nresponses of low SES American participants to transgressions that are\nedgier than the ones Turiel and his colleagues typically use suggests\nthat we do not have to travel abroad to gather data that might\nchallenge Turiel\u2019s definition of morality. This was an idea that\nhad occurred to Turiel quite independently. Two years before\nHaidt\u2019s study appeared, Turiel, Hildebrandt, and Wainryb (1991)\npublished a lengthy monograph in which they explored judgments of\nAmerican high school and college students about a variety of what they\nlabeled \u201cnonprototypical\u201d transgressions. \u201cIn the\nmoral domain\u201d, they tell us,\n\n\nprototypical stimuli essentially present actions entailing harm,\nfairness, or violations of rights in the absence of strong conflicting\nconcerns. (1991: 7)\n\n\nThe prototypical moral transgressions they used in these studies were\nkilling and rape; the non-prototypical transgressions were abortion,\npornography, homosexuality, and incest. Though they did not explicitly\nask whether anyone was harmed by these behaviors, they used responses\nto the justification questions to determine whether participants\nthought that the behaviors were harmful. Not surprisingly, many of the\nparticipants who thought that abortion was \u201cnot all right\u201d\njustified their judgment by appealing to the harm done to the unborn\nchild. Many participants also thought that pornography caused harm,\nand they used this belief to justify their negative evaluation of\npornography. The role of these beliefs is similar to the role of Hindu\nbeliefs about the consequences of eating chicken the day after\none\u2019s father has died. Participants who have these beliefs see\nharm, and offer negative assessments about actions that people who\ndon\u2019t share the beliefs find unproblematic.\n\nBut for our purposes, the most interesting nonprototypical\ntransgression used by Turiel and his colleagues was incest. \u201cOf\nall the nonprototypical issues we investigated\u201d, they tell us,\n\u201cincest was most closely assimilated to reasoning in the moral\ndomain\u201d (1991: 78). A substantial number of participants judged\nthat incest was \u201cnot all right\u201d, they generalized the\njudgment to other countries, and they indicated that their judgment\nwas authority independent\u2014not contingent on the laws or\npractices that prevailed in the United States or elsewhere. So their\nresponses fit the \u201cmoral\u201d pattern of criterion judgments.\nBut typically these participants did not justify their judgments by\nappeal to harm, justice or rights. Rather, they appealed to what\nTuriel and colleagues labeled \u201cdeterministic beliefs\u201d,\nwhich are \u201cstandards dictated by psychological normality,\nbiological order or religious order\u201d or to \u201ccustom and\ntradition\u201d (1991: 24 & 78). So the pattern of criterion\njudgments about incest provided by these participants looks to pose a\ndirect challenge to Turiel\u2019s definition of morality. They\nexhibit the \u201cmoral\u201d criterion judgment pattern, but they\ndo not judge that the transgression is harmful.\n\nIntriguingly, in summing up these findings, Turiel and his colleagues\nappear to walk back the claim that \u201c[t]he meaning of\n\u2018morality\u2019 is something discovered, not stipulated\u201d.\nThey recognize that the judgments about incest offered by some\nparticipants would be classified as moral on the basis of their\ncriterion judgments. But for several reasons the authors have\n\u201cnot chosen this alternative\u201d. They\n\n\nbelieve that it is more precise to restrict \u201cmoral\u201d to\nprototypical judgments and use different terms for judgments that are\nsomewhat different\u2026.\n\n\nAlso, and\n\n\nmost important, our terminology reflects a concern with identifying\nthe components of reasoning, as well as assumptions about reality,\nthat form part of social and moral judgments. (1991: 86)\n\n\nThough this passage, like much of Turiel\u2019s writing, is less than\ncrystal clear, it seems to be saying that restricting the term\n\u201cmoral\u201d to judgments about \u201cprototypical\u201d\ntransgressions (those that involve \u201charm, fairness, or\nviolations of rights in the absence of strong conflicting\nconcerns\u201d) and not applying it to judgments about incest is just\na terminological choice.\n9. The Origin of Moral Judgments: Reason, Emotion, Social Learning or Innate Cognitive Machinery\n\nBy the time they reach their fourth birthday, many children offer what\nsocial domain theorists take to be the \u201cmoral\u201d pattern of\ncriterion judgments about transgressions that involve harm. How do\nthey recognize that these behaviors have a distinct status? According\nto Turiel\u2019s \u201cconstructivist\u201d account, both\nperception and reasoning play a central role. Here is a passage in\nwhich Turiel describes the process in some detail. It focuses on the\nhypothetical example of \u201cEvent A\u201d in which a child in a\nnursery school who wants to use a swing that is being used by another\nchild pushes the other child off the swing and hits him.\n\n\nFor the child to regard the act in Event A as wrong or as a\ntransgression, it is not necessary to be told by others that it is\nwrong, or that he or she model others, or to perceive the act as a\nrule violation. Rather the child can generate prescriptions through\nabstractions from the experience itself (either as an observer or\nparticipant). Important elements in the perception of such an event\nwould be the pain experienced by the victim and the reason for the\noffender\u2019s act. By coordinating these different concepts, the\nchild can generate prescriptions regarding the event. For instance,\nthe child will connect his or her own experience of pain (an\nundesirable experience) to the observed experience of the victim. In\nturn, this will be related to the perceived validity of the\nchild\u2019s motive for harming the other person. Moreover, when the\nchild is the victim, the perception of the undesirability of the\noffender\u2019s act is even more direct and vivid.\n\nOne of the ways children form judgments of moral necessity regarding\nactions of the type depicted in Event A would be through comparison of\nperformance of the act itself with its opposite. In the case of the\nact described in Event A, its negation (in the child\u2019s mental\nactivities) would result in a comparison of its occurrence with its\nnonoccurrence. If the constructed consequences of its nonoccurrence\n(the victim is unharmed) are judged to be more desirable than the\nconsequences of its occurrence (the victim is harmed), then inferences\nwill be made regarding how people should act under those\ncircumstances (e.g., people ought not to hit each other). In\nattempting to understand their social experiences, children form\njudgments about what is right or wrong and fair or unfair. Such\njudgments evolve from the child\u2019s experiences but are not latent\nin the experiences themselves. (Turiel 1983: 43)\n\n\nThis account makes it clear why Haidt favors the term\n\u201crationalist\u201d for views like Turiel\u2019s. The young\nchild is portrayed as doing quite a lot of reasoning. But there is\nmuch in this account that is puzzling. The child is said\nperceive the validity of the assailant\u2019s\nmotive. How does he do that? How does he know which motives are valid\nand which are not? The child also judges that it would be\nmore desirable if the victim is unharmed than if the victim\nis harmed. Why does the child find this outcome more desirable? Having\njudged that it is more desirable if the victim is unharmed, the child\nthen makes an inference about how people should\nact\u2014\u201cpeople ought not to hit each other\u201d.\nBut this conclusion does not follow logically from the premise that it\nis more desirable if the victim is unharmed. So if the\nchild\u2019s inference is deductive then presumably the child is\ninvoking one or more additional premises. What are they and how did\nthe child come to believe them? If the inference is not deductive,\nwhat sort of inference is it, and how does the child come to have the\ncapacity to make this sort of inference? Having made the judgment that\nthe act in Event A is wrong the child will, if asked, make\nmoral-pattern criterion judgments. How does he do that?\nObviously, Turiel\u2019s constructivist account of the processes\nunderlying the formation of criterion judgments in response to\nquestions about harmful transgressions leaves a lot unexplained.\n\nOne influential researcher who has offered a widely discussed\nalternative account is Shaun Nichols. Social learning is the process\nin which normative rules are acquired from parents and other important\npeople in a child\u2019s environment. And while Turiel and other\nsocial domain theorists downplay the importance of social learning, it\nplays a central role in Nichols\u2019 theory. Another widely\ndiscussed idea is that emotion or affect is important in moral\ndevelopment and moral cognition. This is a central theme in\nShaftesbury, Hutcheson, and Hume and in the work of many contemporary\nphilosophers (Kauppinen 2014 [2018]). Though emotion is rarely\nmentioned in Turiel\u2019s work, it is a key element in\nNichols\u2019 explanation of how people distinguish conventional\ntransgressions from transgressions involving harm.\n [17]\n\nOn Nichols\u2019 account, as children mature they acquire an\nincreasingly sophisticated cluster of rules\u2014a normative\ntheory\u2014that specifies which actions are prohibited. The\nnormative theory is acquired primarily via social\n learning[18]\n and includes both moral rules that proscribe harming others under a\nwide variety of circumstances, and conventional rules about such\nmatters as appropriate clothing, etiquette, and classroom behavior.\nHowever, Nichols maintains, Turiel\u2019s work has shown that both\nchildren and adults draw an important distinction in the class of\nbehaviors that are prohibited by the normative theory they have\nacquired. Questions about transgressions in which a victim has been\nharmed and questions about harmless transgressions like wearing\ninappropriate clothing evoke very different responses. What explains\nthe fact that people react differently to different kinds of\ntransgressions? According to Nichols, the answer is provided by the\naffect system. Thinking about some transgressions\u2014most notably\nthose that cause someone to suffer\u2014arouses strong affect in\npeople, and questions about normative transgressions that induce this\nstrong affective reaction evoke different responses than questions\nabout affectively neutral transgressions. However, transgressions\ninvolving harm and suffering are not the only ones that evoke a strong\naffective response. And this leads Nichols to an intriguing\nprediction.\n\n\nOn the account of moral judgment that I\u2019ve proposed, the\nmoral/conventional\n task[19]\n really taps a distinction between a set of norms that are backed by\nan affective system and a set of norms that are not backed by an\naffective system. On this theory, affect-backed normative claims will\nbe treated differently than affect-neutral normative claims. Thus, the\naccount predicts that transgressions of other (non-harm-based) rules\nthat are backed by affective systems should also be treated as\nnon-conventional. As a result, if we find that other affect-backed\nnorms are also distinguished from conventional norms along the\ndimensions of permissibility, seriousness, authority contingency, and\njustification type, then this will provide an independent source of\nevidence for the account of moral judgment that I\u2019ve\nproposed\u2026. To test the prediction we need to exploit a body of\n(non-harm based) rules that are backed by an affective system. (2002:\n227\u2013228)\n\n\nThe affectively potent non-harm based rules Nichols focused on are\nthose that proscribe behaviors likely to evoke disgust. In his first\nexperiment designed to test the theory, Nichols administered his\nversion of the moral/conventional task to participants who had read\nshort vignettes describing prototypical moral transgressions, like one\nchild hitting another, prototypical conventional transgressions, like\na child wearing pajamas to school, and vignettes describing\nnormatively proscribed disgusting behavior. In one of these, Bill, a\nman at a dinner party, spits in his water glass before drinking it. To\nassess whether participants viewed Bill\u2019s transgression to be\nauthority independent, Nichols\u2019 asked:\n\n\nNow what if, before Bill went to the party, the hosts had said,\n\u201cAt our dinner table, anyone can spit in their food or\ndrink\u201d. Would it be O.K. for Bill to spit in his water if the\nhosts say he can? (2002: 229)\n\n\nThe results were consistent with Nichols\u2019 theory.\nParticipants\u2019 judgments about the disgusting transgressions\ndiffered from their judgments about the prototypical conventional\ntransgressions, and resembled their judgments about the prototypical\nmoral transgressions, though the justifications that participants\nprovided were disgust-based rather than harm-based.\n\nIn a second experiment, Nichols sought to confirm that it was the\nemotion of disgust that was responsible for the fact that participants\nin the first experiment treated disgusting transgressions like\nprototypical moral transgressions, rather than like prototypical\nconventional transgressions. To do this, he employed the same\nexperimental strategy used in the first experiment, and then asked\nparticipants to fill out a questionnaire that assesses sensitivity to\ndisgusting stimuli. He found that participants who scored high on the\ndisgust sensitivity scale rated the disgusting transgressions as\nsignificantly more serious than participants who scored low on disgust\nsensitivity. Moreover, the low disgust-sensitivity participants were\nmore likely than the high disgust-sensitivity participants to judge\nthat the disgusting transgressions were authority contingent (2002:\n231).\n\nThe conclusion Nichols urges is that norms prohibiting harmful\nbehavior and norms prohibiting disgusting behavior are part of an\nimportant class of norms that he labels \u201cnorms with\nfeeling\u201d. Though Nichols calls the test that he uses to identify\nviolations of these norms \u201cthe moral/conventional task\u201d,\nthe class of transgressions that evoke what he calls the\n\u201cnon-conventional\u201d response pattern is a much larger, more\nheterogenous, and arguably much less philosophically interesting class\nof transgressions than the ones Turiel claimed to be in the moral\ndomain.\n\nNichols\u2019 theory provoked trenchant criticism from Royzman,\nLeeman, and Baron (2009), who are more sympathetic to Turiel\u2019s\nview that transgressions involving harm are central to moral\ncognition. Their most telling critique focuses on methodological\nproblems with Nichols\u2019 work. Though Nichols\u2019 studies were\ndone about a decade after Haidt, Koller, and Dias (1993) had stressed\nthe importance of asking participants in Turiel-style studies whether\nthey thought the action they were considering had caused any\nharm, Nichols did not ask participants whether anyone was negatively\naffected by the behavior of the protagonists in his disgust scenarios.\nWhen Royzman et al. repeated Nichols\u2019 spitting in the water\nglass experiment and explicitly asked \u201cwas anyone negatively\naffected by [the protagonist\u2019s] action?\u201d 71% of their\nparticipants judged that other guests at the diner table were\nnegatively affected, and those who thought the disgusting behavior was\nharmful were more likely to judge that the protagonist\u2019s\nbehavior was not permissible even if the party host allowed it (2009:\n166\u2013167).\n\nIn a second experiment, Royzman and colleagues explored the\npossibility that participants\u2019 responses to Nichols\u2019\ndisgust sensitivity questionnaire might have been influenced by their\nrecent judgments about the disgusting transgression. When they\nadministered the disgust sensitivity questionnaire two weeks\nbefore participants were asked about the disgusting\ntransgressions, they found that disgust sensitivity was not correlated\nwith responses to questions about whether the action would be wrong\nunder a range of counterfactual circumstances\u2014if there were no\nsocial norm against it, for example, or if it occurred in another\ncountry where it was thought to be OK. Royzman and colleagues call\njudgments that don\u2019t vary under these counterfactual\ncircumstances socially transcendent, and they argue that\nsocial transcendent judgments should be taken to be the fundamental\ncomponent of the moral/conventional task. They found that social\ntranscendence correlated only with ratings of current harm, and not\nwith disgust sensitivity. These experimental findings are, of course,\na direct challenge to Nichols\u2019 \u201cnorms with feeling\u201d\n view.[20]\n What seems to be responsible for \u201cnon-conventional\u201d\nresponses on the moral/conventional task used in Royzman et\nal.\u2019s experiments is not affect, as Nichols\u2019 theory would\nurge, but a judgment that someone is harmed.\n\nRoyzman and colleagues conclude that their findings\n\n\nare largely consistent with Turiel\u2019s basic insight that the\nprocess of selective moralization is effected by a system oriented\ntowards a particular rule content, and that this content is largely\ndefined by acts or dispositions deemed intrinsically harmful to\nothers. (2009: 172\u2013173)\n\n\nBut they do not endorse Turiel\u2019s constructivism. Rather, to\nexplain how people acquire the ability to distinguish moral and\nconventional transgressions they propose a sophisticated version of\nnativism.\n\n\n[T]he data and reflections presented \u2026 appear to constrain the\nanswer to the question about the formation of the\nmoral\u2013conventional distinction to the point where it may be\nplausible to suggest that humans possess, as part as of their evolved\ncognitive machinery, something analogous to Azimov\u2019s\n\u201cFirst Law of Robotics\u201d (in a nutshell: \u201charm no\nhuman\u201d [even if commanded so via the authority of another human,\nincluding one\u2019s human master]), a hard-wired\nproto-prohibition that serves to automatically imbue the\nsocially transmitted rules of a certain kind (those concerned with\none\u2019s impact on the utilities of others) with a special\n(rule-/authority independent) status that registers as social\ntranscendence on the moral-conventional distinction task and that\nappears to be an aspect of moral competence world-wide. (2009:\n173)\n\n\nHaidt\u2019s findings comparing high and low SES participants suggest\nthat there is substantial and systematic variation in judgments about\nwhich transgressions are socially transcendent. It might be thought\nthat this variation is best explained by differences in socially\ntransmitted rules like those that Haidt and his colleagues have\nexplored in their more recent work on Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt\n& Joseph 2007; Graham, Haidt, & Nosek 2009; Haidt 2012;\nGraham, Haidt, Koleva, et al. 2013). But Royzman, Landy, and Goodwin\n(2014) proposed a different, and more disquieting, explanation for\nSES-linked variation in judgments about the social transcendence of\ntransgressions. Social domain theorists recognize that some of the\ntransgressions they classify as conventional can lead to harm by\nupsetting onlookers (as in Nichols\u2019 table manners case) or by\ndisrupting established social routines. But, Royzman and colleagues\nnote, those harms\n\n\nare contingent upon aspects of an existing normative regime\nthat could themselves be deemed arbitrary and modifiable by consensus.\n(2014: 178)\n\n\nBy contrast, the harms caused by what social domain theorists take to\nbe moral transgressions \u201cinvolve acts that are (perceived to be)\nintrinsically harmful to others (Turiel 1983, e.g., p. 44, p.\n221)\u201d (2014: 178). To discern the difference between\ntransgressions that are intrinsically harmful and those that are\ncontingently harmful, one needs to engage in counterfactual thinking.\nOne must ask questions like:\n\nWould it still be harmful to torture a puppy even if everyone in\nthe community thought it was OK? [Yes, it would.] and\nWould it still be harmful to wear pajamas to school even if\neveryone in the community thought it was OK? [No, it\nwouldn\u2019t.]\n\n\nIt is questions like this that are used in some versions of the\nmoral/conventional task to assess whether a transgression is socially\ntranscendent. But, Royzman and colleagues note, not everyone is\nequally inclined to engage in counterfactual thinking or equally good\nat it. And in a striking experiment they found that people with lower\nscores on the Cognitive Reflection Test, which measures people\u2019s\ntendency to give reflective answers instead of following their\nimmediate intuitions, were more likely to judge that behaviors that\nare not intrinsically harmful (like wearing pajamas to work) would not\nbe OK in a culture, even if everyone in that culture had come together\nand decided that it would be OK (Royzman, Landy, & Goodwin\n2014).\n\nRoyzman and colleagues conclude that we should not assume that the\nsort of socioeconomic differences that Haidt found in his\nmoral/conventional task studies are due to fundamentally divergent\nvalues. Rather, since poverty has been linked to impaired cognitive\nperformance, they speculate that the differences between Haidt et\nal.\u2019s high- and low-SES participants is \u201ca product of the\nlow-SES participants\u2019 cognitive limitations\u201d (Royzman,\nLandy, & Goodwin 2014: 187) Needless to say, the suggestion that\nsome of the moral judgments made by low SES people in the USA and\nabroad are the result of impaired cognitive performance is more than a\nbit provocative! Much more work is needed before accepting this\nconclusion, and careful skepticism is warranted: Instead of\nspeculating about the causal role of alleged \u201ccognitive\nlimitations\u201d in explaining why low- and high-SES judgments vary,\nRoyzman and colleagues could have actually collected data from both\nsocio-economic groups and tested the claim directly; unfortunately\nthey didn\u2019t. But if Royzman, Landy, and Goodwin are right, then\nTuriel and other social domain theorists may have been on to something\nimportant when they claimed that harm plays a central role in\ncharacterizing the moral transgressions picked out by the\nmoral/conventional task, though because of their cognitive style\neconomically challenged people may be less able to assess the moral\nimportance of cases involving harms that are not intrinsic.\n10. What Does the Moral/Conventional Task Tell Us About Moral Judgments?\n\nA question that has been center stage in several preceding sections\nis: What sorts of transgressions do Turiel\u2019s moral criterion\njudgments, and other related experimental procedures (collectively\ndubbed the \u201cmoral/conventional task\u201d), classify as moral?\nSocial domain theorists claim that the task picks out transgressions\nthat involve harm, justice, and rights (and more recently fairness and\nequality). Haidt, Shweder, and others claim that their versions of the\ntask picks out a wide range of transgressions, and that different\nsorts of transgressions are picked out in different cultures. Nichols\nclaims that his version of the task picks out transgressions of\nsocially learned norms that engender high affect. And Royzman and\ncolleagues argue that for experimental participants who are able to\nthink clearly about counterfactual issues, their version of the task\npicks out harmful transgressions, where harm is construed broadly.\n\nWhy is this question important? Turiel and other social domain\ntheorists maintain that the moral/conventional task enables us to\nidentify genuine moral judgments, and Haidt, Shweder, and Royzman\nagree, though each focuses on a somewhat different version of the\n task.[21]\n If that\u2019s right, then determining the sort of transgressions\nthat the task classifies as moral will enable us to characterize the\ncontent of moral judgments. So, for example, if Royzman and colleagues\nare right, then all moral judgments are about behaviors that are taken\nto be harmful, and normative judgments that are not about behaviors\ntaken to be harmful are not moral\n judgments.[22]\n Moreover, if it\u2019s true that the moral/conventional task picks\nout genuine moral judgments, this fact would be of enormous importance\nfor psychologists and neuroscientists who want to study the processes\nunderlying moral judgments and the factors that can influence them,\nsince it gives these researchers a way of identifying the judgments\nthey want to\n study.[23]\n And, as we\u2019ll see in the following section, a test that enables\nus to identify genuine moral judgments can also be a valuable tool for\nphilosophers, since a number of philosophical arguments turn on the\nclaim that various categories of people\u2014including children and\npsychopaths\u2014can, or can\u2019t, make genuine moral\njudgments.\n\nRoyzman, Landy, and Goodwin rightly note that the moral/conventional\ntask is \u201cone of the most widely used measures of mature moral\njudgment\u201d (2014: 178). But why should we believe that any\nversion of the moral/conventional task really does enable us to pick\nout genuine moral judgments? As we noted in\n Section 2,\n there is a great deal of philosophical work aimed at providing a\ndefinition of morality, and while some philosophers offered accounts\nthat are compatible with features of the moral/conventional task, many\nphilosophers disagreed. So there is no philosophical consensus about\nthe definition of morality that would support the claim that\nTuriel\u2019s moral/conventional task, or anything in that vicinity,\ncan be used to identify moral judgments. One way around this impasse,\nas we saw in\n Section 5,\n is the suggestion that \u201cmoral judgment\u201d can be regarded\nas a natural kind term, and the hypothesis that the features used in\nthe moral/conventional task are the essential features of the natural\nkind the term denotes. For that hypothesis to be plausible, it would\nhave to be the case that the features used in the moral/conventional\ntask form a nomological cluster. But a number of authors, including\nKelly and colleagues (2007); Fessler, Barrett, and colleagues (2015);\nKumar (2015); and Stich (2019) have argued that findings like those we\nhave reviewed in\n Section 5\n challenge the claim that the features used in the moral/conventional\ntask form a nomological\n cluster.[24]\n The study by Fessler, Barrett, and others poses a further challenge\nto versions of the moral/conventional task that include questions\nabout seriousness since it found that harmful transgressions were\njudged to be less bad when they occurred long ago or far away.\nMoreover, in cultures around the world there is a wide range of\nbehaviors that are considered serious transgressions that are far\nremoved from the familiar schoolyard transgressions typically invoked\nby social domain theorists\u2014transgressions like apostasy and\nblasphemy, necrophilia and speaking ill of the dead, marrying a\ncousin, failure to circumcise one\u2019s sons, and many more. Most of\nthese have never been used in moral/conventional task studies. Since\npeople\u2019s judgments about transgressions like these have never\nbeen studied, we simply do not know whether they would evoke the\npattern of judgments that social domain theorists find for schoolyard\ntransgressions. If they don\u2019t, that might provide additional\nevidence against the claim that moral/conventional task judgments form\nnomological clusters. On the other hand, Royzman, Landy, and Goodwin\n(2014) alert us to the possibility that poor reasoning may be\nresponsible for some, perhaps all, cases where the components of the\nmoral/conventional task come unglued. So much more work will be needed\nbefore we can draw a confident conclusion about whether Turiel\u2019s\n\u201ccriterion judgments\u201d version of the moral/conventional\ntask, or any other version, actually enables us to determine which of\na person\u2019s normative judgments are moral judgments.\n11. The Uses of The Moral/Conventional Task in Philosophy\n\nSusan Dwyer was the pioneer in introducing Turiel\u2019s work to\nphilosophers. In her 1999 paper, \u201cMoral Competence\u201d, she\nproposed an analogy between the psychological mechanisms underlying\nmoral competence and Chomsky\u2019s account of the psychological\nmechanisms underlying linguistic competence. The universality of the\nmoral/conventional distinction and the fact that it emerges very early\nin development, Dwyer argues, are both best explained by the\nhypothesis that \u201cchildren come equipped with something akin to a\nUniversal Moral Grammar\u201d (Dwyer 1999: 169). Prior to\nDwyer\u2019s paper, references to Turiel and other social domain\ntheorists were infrequent in the philosophical literature, and we know\nof no substantive discussions of the philosophical implications of\ntheir findings. But that soon changed.\n\nAs we saw in\n Section 9,\n Turiel\u2019s work played an important role in Nichols\u2019 (2002)\nelaboration and defense of his version of moral sentimentalism. In\nanother pair of publications (Nichols 2004: Ch. 4; 2007) Nichols\ninvoked the work of the social domain theorists (Turiel 1983; Smetana\n1989, 1993; Tisak 1995) to mount an argument against what he took,\nplausibly enough, to be the most visible and carefully developed\nalternative version of sentimentalism, developed by Alan Gibbard\n(1990). The problem with Gibbard\u2019s theory, Nichols maintains, is\nthat it is \u201cseriously overintellectualized\u201d and\n\u201ctoo ingenious to be a plausible account of normal\nmoral judgment\u201d (Nichols 2007: 261 & 259). On\nGibbard\u2019s account,\n\n\nwhat a person does is morally wrong if and only if it is\nrational for him to feel guilty for doing it and for others to resent\nhim for doing it. (Gibbard 1990: 42, quoted in Nichols 2007: 258)\n\n\nBut, Nichols argues,\n\n\nif moral judgments are judgments of the appropriateness of guilt, then\nan individual cannot have the capacity to make moral judgments\nunless she also has the capacity to make judgments about the\nappropriateness of guilt. (Nichols 2007: 259, italics in the\noriginal)\n\n\nand developmental psychologists tell us that \u201cchildren\ndon\u2019t understand complex emotions like guilt \u2026 until\naround age 7\u201d (Nichols 2007: 261). However, according to\nNichols, children make moral judgments much earlier. The crucial step\nin Nichols\u2019 argument for this latter claim is that \u201ca\nbasic capacity for moral judgment is reflected by passing the\nmoral/conventional task\u201d (2004: 89). And, as Turiel and his\ncolleagues have repeatedly shown, children succeed at the\nmoral/conventional task\u2014they give typical adult responses to\nschoolyard examples of moral and conventional transgressions\u2014by\nthe age of four or earlier. Since four year-olds can make moral\njudgments but don\u2019t understand guilt, Nichols concludes that\nGibbard\u2019s version of sentimentalism is incompatible with the\nempirical\n facts.[25]\n\nOver the last two decades, discussion of the work of social domain\ntheorists became substantially more common in the philosophical\nliterature. Joseph Heath offers an intriguing explanation for some of\nthe philosophical interest in this work. It is, he maintains,\nmotivated by the widespread resistance, among moral philosophers,\n\u201cto the idea that morality could simply be a part of\nculture, because \u2026 many elements of culture vary\nenormously from place to place\u2026\u201d (2017: 277). These\nphilosophers, Heath contends,\n\n\nare inclined to think that what is morally acceptable or unacceptable\nis universal and invariant, so that certain actions are morally\nwrong even if the prevailing set of norms in a culture fails\nto condemn them as such \u2026. Acknowledging \u2026 that moral\nrules are a species of social norm, and that they have a lot in common\nwith rules of etiquette, appears to set in motion a dynamic that leads\nto moral relativism.\n\nIn recent years, the impulse to distinguish moral rules from other\ntypes of social norms has received what many philosophers take to be\nempirical support from the psychological research of Elliot Turiel and\nhis collaborators. Turiel is well-known for having argued that there\nare two distinct \u201cdomains\u201d of social cognition, the\n\u201cmoral\u201d and the \u201cconventional,\u201d and that even\nvery young children are able to distinguish the two. Many philosophers\nhave been quick to jump on this, as proof that moral rules are\nfundamentally different from \u201cconventional\u201d social norms.\nJesse Prinz, for instance, appeals to Turiel\u2019s authority in\nclaiming that \u201cBy the time children are 3, they recognize that\nsome rules are moral (e.g. don\u2019t hit other children) and others\nare merely conventional (don\u2019t talk without raising your\nhand)\u201d (Prinz 2006, 29\u201343; see also Joyce 2006[a],\n136\u2013137; Nichols 2004, 5\u20137). Gerald Gaus, again citing\nTuriel, writes that \u201ceven children see moral rules as\nnon-conventional\u201d (2010, 172). This is often a prelude to the\nclaim that moral judgments are generated by some special moral\nfaculty, or set of emotional reactions, or rational capacity, that\nputs them outside the space of social norms (and thus, many will\nargue, exempts them from cultural variability). (Heath 2017:\n277\u2013278)\n\n\nThe idea that moral judgments are generated by a \u201cspecial moral\nfaculty\u201d can be developed in a variety of ways, some of which\nhave led to a resurgence of interest in moral nativism. As noted\nearlier, Turiel and his fellow social domain theorists are\nconstructivists who reject nativist accounts of the morality. But a\nnumber of philosophers, including Susan Dwyer (Dwyer 1999, 2006, 2007;\nDwyer, Huebner, & Hauser 2010), Richard Joyce (2006a, 2006b), John\nMikhail (2014, 2022), and Shaun Nichols (2005) have used the findings\nof the social domain theorists in arguments aimed at establishing that\nsubstantial aspects of morality are innate. Some of these authors go\non to argue morality is the product of natural selection and that it\nis an adaptation. Other philosophers, notably Jesse Prinz (2007a: ch.\n7; 2007b) and Edouard Machery and Ron Mallon (2010) have elaborated\ndetailed responses.\n\nThe most extensive appeal to empirical work on the moral/conventional\ndistinction in the philosophical literature has been in the\nintertwined debates over moral internalism and the moral\nresponsibility of psychopaths. To explain these debates, a bit of\nbackground is needed. When someone judges that an action is the\nmorally right or morally required thing to do it is often the case\nthat she goes on to do it. Why? What is her motivation for\ndoing what she judges to be morally required? From the ancient Greeks\nonward, philosophers have been interested in moral motivation, and in\nrecent decades debates over the nature of moral motivation have played\na prominent role in metaethics. One central component in this\nmulti-faceted discussion is the debate between various versions of\ninternalism, which hold\n\n\nthat motivation is internal to moral judgment, in the sense that moral\njudgment itself motivates without need of an accompanying desire,\n\n\nand various versions of externalism which insist that\n\n\nmoral motivation occurs when a moral judgment combines with a desire,\nand the content of the judgment is related to the content of the\ndesire so as to rationalize the action.\n\n\nThe quotes are from Rosati\u2019s outstanding Stanford\nEncyclopedia of Philosophy overview of the moral motivation\nliterature (Rosati 2016: \u00a73; entry on\n moral motivation)\n in which she goes on to note that\n\n\ndebates between internalists and externalists often center on the\nfigure of the \u201camoralist\u201d\u2014the person who apparently\nmakes moral judgments, while remaining wholly unmoved to comply with\nthem.\n\n\nInternalists typically insist that the amoralist is a conceptual\nimpossibility, and that\n\n\nthe person who appears to be making a moral judgment while\nremaining unmoved, must really \u2026 be speaking\ninsincerely\u2026. [S]he judges an act \u201cright\u201d only in\nan \u201cinverted commas\u201d sense (R.M. Hare, 1963)\u2026.\n(Rosati 2016: \u00a73)\n\n\nHowever, some philosophers think that psychopaths provide a prima\nfacie challenge to this claim.\n\nPsychopaths, who are diagnosed using a standard psychopathy checklist\n(Robert Hare 1991) are individuals who appear to be cognitively\nnormal. They typically do not have impaired reasoning abilities, and\nthey are aware of and seem able to comprehend prevailing moral and\nsocial rules. However, psychopaths often engage in antisocial behavior\nand they manifest no guilt or remorse for their morally aberrant\nbehavior. Since psychopaths apparently can, and often do make moral\njudgments that they are not motivated to comply with, they seem to\npose a problem for internalists. Indeed, borrowing an apt locution\nfrom Roskies (2003), psychopaths would appear to be \u201cwalking\ncounterexamples\u201d to\n internalism.[26]\n\nIt\u2019s at this point that the moral/conventional distinction\nbecomes relevant. In an influential paper, psychologist R. James Blair\n(1995) reported using a version of the moral/conventional task with\nincarcerated psychopathic offenders of normal intelligence and with\nincarcerated non-psychopathic offenders, all of whom were charged with\nmurder or manslaughter. The responses of the non-psychopathic\noffenders were similar to those that social domain theorists have\nreported with normal adults, but the responses of the psychopathic\noffenders were notably different. They responded in the same way to\nmoral and conventional\n transgressions.[27]\n Similar results were reported in a study that compared children with\npsychopathic tendencies to non-psychopathic children who had other\nemotional and behavioral issues (Blair 1997). These results led a\nnumber of authors to conclude that psychopaths do not have\n\u201cnormal moral concepts\u201d (Prinz 2007a: 42\u201347), or\nthat their moral concepts are \u201cimpaired\u201d (Schroeder,\nRoskies, & Nichols 2010: 96; Nichols 2004: 19 & 113), and thus\nthat they \u201cdo not mean what the rest of us mean when using moral\nterms\u201d (Kennett & Fine 2007: 175). If that\u2019s right,\nthen, these authors maintained, psychopaths do not really make moral\njudgments, as ordinarily understood, and they pose no challenge to\ninternalism. However, Kumar (2016) argues that philosophers have often\noverinterpreted Blair\u2019s findings. Though the studies indicate\nthat psychopaths \u201cdo not have a full grasp of moral\nconcepts\u201d, Kumar maintains that the studies do not show that\npsychopaths \u201ccompletely fail to grasp them\u201d. So while\npsychopaths don\u2019t make \u201cfull-fledged moral\njudgments\u201d, they can and do make what Kumar calls \u201cproto\nmoral judgments\u201d. Because of this, Kumar maintains, the\nimplications of research on psychopaths for the debate between\ninternalists and externalists is \u201cless straightforward\u201d\nthen philosophers have assumed. In a similar vein, Roskies (2007: 204)\nargues that studies of psychopaths do not establish \u201cthat they\nlack moral concepts or an adequate understanding of them\u201d or\nthat they are \u201cincapable of anything but moral judgments in an\ninverted comma sense\u201d.\n\nIn addition to being invoked in debates between internalists and\nexternalists, Blair\u2019s studies have also played a role in\nphilosophical discussions of the conditions under which people are\nmorally responsible for their behavior. Neil Levy has argued that\npsychopaths \u201cought to be excused moral responsibility for their\nwrongdoing\u201d because their \u201cfailure to grasp the\nmoral/conventional distinction\u201d indicates that they do not\nunderstand \u201cwhat makes a moral norm moral\u201d (Levy 2007b:\n163\u2013164).\n\n\nPsychopaths know, at least typically, that their actions are widely\nperceived to be wrong, to be sure, but they are unable to grasp the\ndistinctive nature and significance of their wrongness. Psychopaths\napparently take harm to others to be wrong only because such\nharms are against the rules. For them, stealing from, or hurting,\nanother is no more wrong than, say, double-parking or line-jumping.\nBut the kind and degree of wrongness, and therefore blame, that\nattaches to infringement of the rules is very different, and usually\nmuch less significant, than the kind and degree attaching to moral\nwrongs. For psychopaths, all offences are merely conventional, and\ntherefore\u2014from their point of view\u2014none of them are all\nthat serious. Hence, their degree of responsibility is smaller,\narguably much smaller, than it would be for a comparable harm\ncommitted by a normal agent. Indeed, there are grounds for excusing\nthem from moral responsibility altogether. (Levy 2007a: 132)\n\n\nFine and Kennett defend a very similar conclusion:\n\n\n[W]hile psychopathic offenders certainly appear to know what acts are\nprohibited by society or the law (and therefore know that their\ntransgressions are legally wrong), they do not appear to have the\ncapacity to judge an act to be morally wrong\u2026. We would argue\nthat psychopathic offenders, who fail to understand the distinction\nbetween moral wrongs and conventional wrongs, cannot be considered to\nbe moral agents. (2004: 432)\n\n\nSince Levy, Fine, and Kennett all take moral responsibility to be\nnecessary for criminal responsibility, they maintain that psychopaths\nare not criminally responsible.\n\nOther authors draw quite different conclusions from Blair\u2019s\nstudies. Both Maibom (2008) and Vargas and Nichols (2007) note that\ndespite their apparent inability to distinguish moral from\nconventional transgressions, psychopaths are sensitive to the fact\nthat there are norms prohibiting a wide range of behaviors, and that\nviolating these norms can lead to sanctions. For Maibom, this\nawareness is enough to undergird both moral and criminal\nresponsibility. Endorsing a similar view, Vargas and Nichols note that\n\u201cwe do think it is appropriate to blame and punish transgressors\nof conventional rules\u201d. Why, they ask, \u201cis this not enough\nto blame and punish psychopaths?\u201d (2007: 159).\n\nDavid Shoemaker (2011) is skeptical about drawing any conclusions\nabout the moral or criminal responsibility of psychopaths based on\nBlair\u2019s studies. In support of his skepticism, he draws\nattention to critiques of work in the Turiel tradition by Nissan\n(1987); Haidt, Koller, and Dias (1993); Kelly et al. (2007); and\nothers. More pointedly, he stresses that judgments about the\nseriousness of a transgression play a central role in Blair\u2019s\nversion of the moral/conventional task, and he challenges the\nassumption that moral transgressions are judged to be more serious\nthan putatively conventional transgressions. Shoemaker references a\nstudy by Elizabeth Fitton and Ann Dowker who controlled for perceived\nseriousness and found that\n\n\nwhen the so-called conventional transgressions matched the so-called\nmoral transgressions in perceived seriousness \u2026 [normal]\nchildren failed to differentiate the domains \u201cin terms of rule\ncontingency, perceived obligations and the justifications used.\u201d\nIndeed, these children tended to judge that the conventional behaviors\nwere more obligatory than the moral ones. (Shoemaker 2011:\n107, italics in original, quoting a 2002 paper presented at the MOSAIC\nconference in Liverpool \u201cQualitative and Quantitative Dimensions\nof Domain Differentiation\u201d)\n\n\nShoemaker\u2019s skepticism about the philosophical importance of\nBlair\u2019s findings is reinforced by the work of Aharoni and\ncolleagues (2012) who undertook a conceptual replication of\nBlair\u2019s prisoner study using a modified version of the\nmoral/conventional task that focused on authority independence and\nused a forced-choice format to minimize strategic responding. Their\nstudy included 109 incarcerated criminal offenders. (In Blair\u2019s\noriginal study there were only ten psychopathic participants and 10\nnon-psychopaths.) To assess the level of psychopathy for each inmate\nparticipant, they used Hare\u2019s Revised Psychopathy Checklist\nalong with two other measures. The crucial finding was that\n\n\ntotal psychopathy score did not predict performance on the\n[moral/conventional] task.\n\n\nAharoni and colleagues conclude that\n\n\ncontrary to earlier claims, insufficient data exist to infer that\npsychopathic individuals cannot know what is morally wrong. (2012:\n484)\n\n\nThe moral/conventional task is not the only tool that psychologists\nhave used to explore deficits in moral reasoning. In a survey of the\nliterature, Schaich Borg and Sinnott-Armstrong (2013) review the\nfindings of studies with psychopaths using the moral/conventional task\nand five quite different tools. Their conclusion is hardly encouraging\nfor philosophers who hope that studies of moral cognition in\npsychopaths will yield important philosophical payoffs.\n\n\nThe studies reviewed in this chapter support a tentative and qualified\nconclusion: If psychopaths have any deficits or abnormalities in their\nmoral judgments, their deficits seem subtle\u2014much more subtle\nthan might be expected from their blatantly abnormal behavior. Indeed,\nthe current literature \u2026 suggests that psychopaths might not\nhave any specific deficits in moral cognition, despite their\ndifferences in moral action, emotion, and empathy. (2013: 123)\n\n\nThe take-home message of this section is that authors who invoke\nstudies using the moral/conventional task in arguing for philosophical\nconclusions should be very cautious. There are many different versions\nof the task, and it is far from clear that any of them give us\nreliable information about the nature of moral cognition or about the\nmoral cognition of children, psychopaths or other groups of\nphilosophical interest.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aharoni, Eyal, Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, and Kent A.
