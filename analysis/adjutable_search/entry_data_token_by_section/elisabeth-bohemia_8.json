    "main_text": "Correspondence with Ren\u00e9 Descartes || The Passions and Moral Philosophy\n4.5 Political Philosophy\n\nElisabeth\u2019s interest in properly evaluating actions and their outcomes\nis clearly related to her position as an exiled Princess, one with\nhopes that her family will regain some of their political power. She\nis particularly concerned with the problems that rulers face making\ndecisions that stand to impact a large group of people with incomplete\ninformation. To this end, she asks Descartes to present the central\nmaxims \u201cconcerning civil life\u201d (AT 4:406, 25 April 1646),\nand for his thoughts on Machiavelli\u2019s The Prince. Descartes\npolitely refuses the former, but offers his thoughts on the latter in\nhis letter of September 1646. Elisabeth offers her own reading in her\nletter of 10 October 1646. In her view Machiavelli\u2019s focus on a state\nthat is the most difficult to govern does provide useful guidance for\nachieving stability, but affords little for how to proceed in\ngoverning a stable state. Paganani (2021) situates this exchange\nwithin the broader 17th century context, both the political\nrealities and the political philosophy, and in particular, Hobbes. He\nargues that Elisabeth took Machiavelli\u2019s realism as a starting\npoint, to begin to work through her own solution to how to resolve the\nconflicts arising from competing evaluations of self-interested\nagents, each moved by their own desires and passions, and ensure\nmutual security, peace, and insofar as possible individual well-being.\nElisabeth rejects Descartes\u2019appeal to divine guarantee, and,\nperhaps rooted in her own actual practice and public role, favours a\npragmatic and operational approach to navigating charged political\nrealities. He argues that she puts forward a distinctive position on\nthe politics of moral action, and in particular on the problem of how\nnatural law applies in a wicked world.\n\nShapiro (2021) explores a remark Elisabeth makes in her letter to\nDescartes of 4 December 1649 on the apparent incompatibility of\ngoverning and philosophizing (AT 5:452), and argues that Elisabeth\nrecognizes that rulers, and not simply their subjects, inevitably have\ntheir own passions, which must be regulated according to the demands\nof their office. These practical demands, and in particular the time\nconstraints of their decision-making, can leave a ruler with a very\ndifferent affective profile from that of the philosopher.\n\nGiven the suggestion of Pal (2021) that Elisabeth\u2019s own\ninterests centred on how to govern well, this part of her\ncorrespondence gains significance. It is reasonable to assume that\nfurther consideration on these issues informed her management of the\nconvent at Herford, and perhaps led her to find a way both to govern\nand to pursue her intellectual interests at the same time.\n",
