    "main_text": "Brentano\u2019s Theory of Mind || Inner Perception, Unity of Consciousness and the Tripartition of Mental Phenomena\n3.1 Inner Perception, Unity of Consciousness and the Tripartition of Mental Phenomena\n\nAll mental phenomena have in common, Brentano argues, \u201cthat they\nare only perceived in inner consciousness, while in the case of\nphysical phenomena only external perception is possible\u201d\n(PES, 70) [\u201cda\u00df sie nur in innerem\nBewu\u00dftsein wahrgenommen werden, w\u00e4hrend bei den physischen\nnur \u00e4u\u00dfere Wahrnehmung m\u00f6glich ist.\u201d\n(PES 128)]. According to Brentano, the former of these two\nforms of perception provides an unmistakable evidence for what is\ntrue. Since the German word for perception (Wahrnehmung),\nliterally translated, means \u201ctaking-true\u201d, Brentano says\nthat it is the only kind of perception in a strict sense. He points\nout that inner perception must not be mixed up with inner observation,\nwhich would require that one is having a mental act, the act of\nobserving, that is directed towards another mental act, the act\nobserved. Inner perception, on the other hand, must not be conceived\nas a full-fledged act that accompanies another mental act towards\nwhich it is directed. It is rather interwoven with the latter: in\naddition to being primarily directed towards an object, every mental\nact is incidentally directed towards itself as a secondary\nobject. When I see a tree, for example, the primary object of my\nvisual experience is the tree. But I am also aware that I am\nseeing and not, say, hearing or touching the tree; I am, in\nother words, aware of the fact that I have a mental phenomenon that is\ndirected towards the tree. This is possible because one and the same\nmental phenomenon, my visual experience, is directed not only towards\nits primary object, the tree, it is incidentally directed\nalso towards itself as a secondary object. \n\n\u201cThe presentation of the sound and the presentation of the\npresentation of the sound form one single mental phenomenon; it is\nonly by considering it in its relation to two different objects, one\nof which is a physical phenomenon and the other a mental phenomenon,\nthat we divide it conceptually into two presentations. In the same\nmental phenomenon in which the sound is present to our minds we\nsimultaneously apprehend the mental phenomenon itself. What is more,\nwe apprehend it in accordance with its dual nature insofar as it has\nthe sound as content within it, and insofar as it has itself as\ncontent at the same time.\u201d (PES, 98)\n\n[\u201cDie Vorstellung des Tones und die Vorstellung von der\nVorstellung des Tones bilden nicht mehr als ein einziges psychisches\nPh\u00e4nomen, das wir nur, indem wir es in seiner Beziehung auf zwei\nverschiedene Objekte, deren eines ein physisches, und deren anderes\nein psychisches Ph\u00e4nomen ist, betrachten, begrifflich in zwei\nVorstellungen zergliederten. In demselben psychischen Ph\u00e4nomen,\nin welchem der Ton vorgestellt wird, erfassen wir zugleich das\npsychische Ph\u00e4nomen selbst, und zwar nach seiner doppelten\nEigent\u00fcmlichkeit, insofern es als Inhalt den Ton in sich hat, und\ninsofern es zugleich sich selbst als Inhalt gegenw\u00e4rtig\nist.\u201d (PES, 179)]\n\n\nAccording to Brentano, every mental phenomenon is directed\ntowards itself as a secondary object; inner perception is, thus, a\nform of mechanism on the basis of which we become aware of our own\nmental phenomena.\n\nAs a consequence, Brentano denies the idea that there could be\nunconscious mental acts: since every mental act is\nincidentally directed towards itself as a secondary object, we are\nautomatically aware of every occurring mental act. He admits, however,\nthat we can have mental acts of various degrees of intensity. In\naddition, he holds that the degree of intensity with which the object\nis presented is equal to the degree of intensity in which the\nsecondary object, i.e., the act itself, is presented. Consequently, if\nwe have a mental act of a very low intensity, our inner perception of\nthe act or, as he puts it, our secondary consciousness of it will also\nhave a very low intensity. From this Brentano concludes that sometimes\nwe are inclined to say that we had an unconscious mental phenomenon\nwhen actually we had a conscious mental phenomenon of very low\nintensity.\n\nConsciousness, Brentano argues, always forms a unity. While we can\nperceive a number of physical phenomena at one and the same time, we\ncan only perceive one mental phenomenon at a specific point in time.\nWhen we seem to have more than one mental act at a time, like when we\nare listening to a melody while tasting a sip of red wine and enjoying\nthe beautiful view from the window, all these mental phenomena melt\ninto one, they become moments or, to stick with Brentano\u2019s\nterminology, divisives of a collective. If one of the divisives ends\nin the course of time, e.g., when I swallow the wine and turn my eyes\nto the fireplace, but continue to listen to the music, the collective\ngoes on to exist. Brentano\u2019s views on the unity of consciousness\nentail that inner observation, as explained above, is strictly\nimpossible, for this would require us to have two distinct acts in the\nvery same moment. Of course it is possible to remember\nanother mental act one had a moment ago, or expect future mental acts,\nbut due to the unity of consciousness one cannot have two distinct\nmental acts, one of which being directed towards the other, at the\nsame time.\n\nThe fact that we can be directed towards one and the same object in\ndifferent ways allows Brentano to introduce a classification of mental\nphenomena. He distinguishes three basic kinds: presentations,\njudgments, and emotions (which he refers to as \u201cphenomena of\nlove and hate\u201d). These are not three completely distinct\nclasses, though. Presentations are the most basic kind of acts; we\nhave a presentation each time when we are directed towards an object,\nbe it that we are imagining, seeing, remembering, or expecting it,\netc. In his Psychology Brentano held that two presentations\ncan differ only in the object, towards which they are directed. Later\nhe modified his position, though, and argued that they can also differ\nin various modes, such as temporal modes (cf. PES 217 [This\ntext is part of the appendix to the second part of PES from\n1911 \u2013 for the German original cf. PES, vol II, 142]). The two\nother categories, judgments and phenomena of love and hate, are based\non presentations. In a judgment we accept or deny the existence of the\npresented object. A judgment, thus, is a presentation plus a\nqualitative mode of acceptance or denial. The third category, which\nBrentano names\u00a0\u201cphenomena of love and hate,\u201d\ncomprises emotions, feelings, desires and acts of will. In these acts\nwe have positive or negative feelings or attitudes towards an object.\n\n\nBrentano\u2019s tripartition of mental phenomena is a basic element\nof his theory that remained central for his whole life. The fact that\nhe saw himself constrained to make minor adjustments shows that\nBrentano did approach philosophy in a very systematic manner and\nalways had the bigger picture in mind. It can, thus, be taken as\nevidence that \u201cin his mind Brentano was continuously refining\nand chiseling away at a unified system, a system that harmonized and\nstabilized the bits and pieces in his messy literary state\u201d\n(Kriegel 2017a, 29). \n\nMoreover, his conception of secondary consciousness, in combination\nwith this thesis of the unity of consciousness have had a strong echo\nin the philosophy of mind, in particular in the recent debate\nconcerning the nature of consciousness. It has been suggested that\nBrentano\u2019s notion of secondary consciousness (i.e., the thesis\nthat every mental phenomenon is incidentally directed also towards\nitself as a secondary object) can provide the means to overcome\nhigher-order theories of consciousness that have been widely discussed\nin the late twentieth century. In this debate, the exact reading of\nBrentano\u2019s thesis was often at stake. Some philosophers have\nsuggested that Brentano\u2019s view, according to which every mental\nphenomenon is object of inner perception, was an early expression of a\nhigher-order perception theory of consciousness (cf., for example,\nG\u00fczeldere 1997, 789). This interpretation, however, does not pay\ndue attention to the fact that according to Brentano, inner perception\nis not a self-standing mental phenomenon of a higher level, but rather\na structural moment of every mental phenomenon. Moreover,\nwith his unity of consciousness thesis Brentano explicitly rejects the\nbasic assumption of all higher-order perception theories of\nconsciousness, i.e., the idea that we can have two mental phenomena\n(of distinct levels) at the same time, one of them being directed\ntowards the other: higher-order perception theories postulate what\nBrentano calls \u2018inner observation\u2019 (as opposed to inner\nperception), which according to him was impossible, as we have seen\nabove. \n\nAccordingly, a number of recent interpreters have suggested that\nBrentano was an advocate of a one-level account of consciousness:\n\u201cSince the features that make an act conscious are firmly\nlocated within the act itself rather than bestowed on it by a second\nact, this locates Brentano\u2019s view as a one-level view of\nconsciousness\u201d (Thomasson, 2000, 192). This reading has given\nplace to neo-Brentanian theories such as Thomasson\u2019s adverbial\naccount (cf. Thomasson 2000) or self-representational approaches (cf.,\nfor example, Kriegel 2003a, b) that build on the thesis that\n\u201cevery conscious state has a dual representational content. Its\nmain content is the normal content commonly attributed to mental\nrepresentations. But it also has a (rather peripheral) special\ncontent, namely, its own occurrence\u201d (Kriegel 2003a, 480), which\nthey take as Brentano\u2019s central thesis. Moreover, Kriegel\nsuggests that for Brentano this self-representational aspect is a\nnecessary condition for having a presentation (Kriegel 2013). \n\nOther interprets have taken more cautious lines. Mark Textor (2006),\nfor example, has stressed the ties between Brentano\u2019s notion of\nsecondary consciousness and his thesis of the unity of consciousness.\nA mental phenomenon, according to Textor\u2019s interpretation of\nBrentano\u2019s theory, does not become conscious by representing\nitself, but rather by its being unified or fused with an\nimmediately evident cognition of it. Dan Zahavi, on the other hand,\nhas insisted that Brentano does distinguish two levels of perception,\nwhich sheds doubts on the one-level interpretation: \u201cIt could be\nargued that Brentano\u2019s claim that every conscious intentional\nstate takes two objects, a primary (external) object and secondary\n(internal) object, remains committed to a higher-order account of\nconsciousness; it simply postulates it as being implicitly contained\nin every conscious state\u201d (Zahavi, 2006, 5). In short,\nBrentano\u2019s distinction between primary and secondary\nconsciousness \u201cintroduces some kind of level-distinction into\nthe structure of experience\u201d (Brandl 2013, 61) but does not\nconceive of higher-perception as a full-fledged mental phenomenon at\nits own, which is why Brandl has recently proposed to regard it a\n\u2018one-and-a-half-level theory\u2019 (Brandl 2013, 61f).\n\nWhile the debate concerning the exact interpretation of his views\nconcerning secondary consciousness is still open, it underlines the\nrelevance of Brentano\u2019s contributions to contemporary philosophy\nof mind. \n",
