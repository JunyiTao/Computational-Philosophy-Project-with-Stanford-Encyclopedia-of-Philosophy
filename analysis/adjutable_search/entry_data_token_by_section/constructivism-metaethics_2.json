    "main_text": "Varieties of Kantian Constructivism || Kant\u2019s Constructivism\n2.1 Kant\u2019s Constructivism\n\nJohn Rawls first proposed a constructivist interpretation of\nKant\u2019s account of moral obligation and practical reason (Rawls\n1980, 2000). On Rawls\u2019 reading, Kant\u2019s analysis of\nobligation commits him to a kind of constructivism, which is best\nunderstood in contrast to competing views of moral obligation (Rawls\n1980, 1989, 2000). Kant holds that all previous ethical theories have\nfailed to account for moral obligation because they have failed\nas theories of practical reason (Kant G 4:\n441\u2013444; C2 5: 35\u201341, 153, 157). They fail to\nexplain how reason plays a role in our lives because they\nmisunderstand its practical function and mischaracterize its relation\nwith the ends of choice. Kant\u2019s charge is directed against all\nprevious moral doctrines, but his arguments specifically address\nsentimentalism and \u2018dogmatic rationalism\u2019. Sentimentalism,\nchampioned by Francis Hutcheson, David Hume, and Adam Smith, holds\nthat ethical judgments stem from sentiments and regards reason as\nincapable of moving us to action on its own. According to the\nsentimentalist, the role of reason is solely instrumental. That is,\nreason merely finds the means to satisfy an agent\u2019s ends, and it\nis not capable of indicating which ends are worth pursuing. This claim\nexposes sentimentalism as a \u201cheteronomous\u201d doctrine, which\nfails to establish the objectivity of moral obligations. This is\nbecause sentimentalism treats moral obligations as conditional upon\nour interests, and thus as having limited authority.\n\nKant raises the same objection against dogmatic rationalism,\nchampioned by Christian Wolff and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, which\nholds that there are real moral truths that we apprehend by rational\ninsight (Kant G 4: 443; Rawls 2000: 50, 228). This view\nappears to be an intuitionist form of moral realism according to which\nreason recognizes objective values or moral ends that exist prior to\nand independently of our reasoning and of the kinds of agents that we\nare. In discovering such ends, moral agents do not actively exercise\nreasoning; they are as passive as in sensory perception. For Kant,\ndogmatic rationalism fails to secure the conclusion that moral\nobligations have unconditional authority over us (Kant G, 4:\n441). This is because, for dogmatic rationalism, moral truths guide us\nonly on the condition that we have a corresponding desire to be guided\nby what is rational (Rawls 1980: 343\u201346; Rawls 1989:\n510\u201313).\n\nKant\u2019s diagnosis is that all such doctrines fail to capture the\npractical function of reason because they are heteronomous. They deny\nthe authority and efficacy of reason, either holding that reason can\nonly recognize objective ends that exist independently of its\noperations, or claiming that reason can bind agents only with the help\nof inclination or interest. For Kant heteronomy is a form of moral\nskepticism, understood as skepticism about the power of reason to\nestablish moral truths and their authority. On this reading, then,\nconstructivism is part of Kant\u2019s overall argument for grounding\nethics in reason, against the skeptical view that there are no\nnormative truths (Korsgaard 1996a; Stern 2013; Wallace 2012).\nSkepticism is avoided only if reason is accounted as autonomous, and\nits authority does not derive from anything outside it. Reason is\nautonomous if its authority rests on its proper activity, rather than\nbeing derived from elements of the world outside of reason. Thus, the\nnorm governing the activity of reason must be internal to reason,\nrather than dependent on any given value, interest, or desire. That is\nto say that reason is a \u201cself-legislative activity\u201d (Kant\nG 4: \u00a72), and its legislative activity is governed by a\nnorm, which Kant calls the \u2018Categorical Imperative.\u2019 The\nCategorical Imperative expresses the autonomy of reason and is its\ngoverning principle. It is not a mere decision-procedure to determine\nwhat to do, but the \u2018constitutive norm\u2019 of reason, that\nis, the basic standard of rationality in thinking and acting (Rawls\n1989: 498\u2013506; Rawls 2000: 166, 240\u2013244; Korsgaard 1996a:\n36\u201337; O\u2019Neill 1989b: 18\u201319, 59n, 128, 180; Bagnoli\n2013b; Reath 2006: 221\u2013222; Reath & Timmermann 2010;\nEngstrom 2009: Chapter 5).\n\nKant gives several formulations of the Categorical Imperative, which\nhe regards as equivalent (G 4: 421, 429, 431, 433); but\nultimately, it is the requirement that in deliberating, we test our\nmotives by considering whether the principle they express can be\nendorsed as a universal law, a principle that applies to and binds all\nagents endowed with rational capacities. Kant is committed to the\n\u201cconstitutivist view\u201d that the source of the categorical\nforce of moral obligations lies in the constitutive features of\nrational agency (Rawls 2000: 263\u2013265; O\u2019Neill 1989a,\nKorsgaard 1996a: 236ff). We will return to this point in\n section 7.\n\nScholars are divided about the significance of the arguments in\nsupport of a constructivist interpretation of Kant\u2019s theory of\npractical reason, even though nobody denies that, for Kant, the laws\nof the mind are laws of reason (compare Guyer 2013 and Engstrom 2013;\nBagnoli 2013b). The most general source of reservations about the\nconstructivist interpretation is that constructivism builds upon the\ncritique of realism, but Kant\u2019s claims about objective moral\nknowledge seem best vindicated by moral realism. In this dispute,\nconstructivism is generally taken to be a form of antirealism (Ameriks\n2003: 268, 274; Wood 2008: 108, 337, 374\u2013375). It should be\nnoted, however, that Rawls introduced Kant\u2019s constructivism as a\nnovel alternative to both realism and antirealism, where the latter\nincludes subjectivism and relativism (Rawls 1980; O\u2019Neill 1989a:\n1; Engstrom 2013: 138ff).\n\nAccording to some interpreters, Kant\u2019s defense of the autonomy\nof reason takes place within a project of identifying the foundation\nof morality, which is realist in spirit because it appeals to the\nabsolute value of humanity (Wood 1999: 157, 114; Rauscher 2002;\nLangton 2007; Johnson 2007; Hills 2008; Krasnoff 1999; Kain 2006a,b;\nIrwin 2009; Galvin 2011). There are different ways to argue for this\npoint. First, critics point out that Kant\u2019s defense provides a\ntranscendental argument, an argument that highlights the conditions\nunder which it is possible for something to be the case. The value of\nhumanity is the condition of the possibility of all valuing. To such\ncritics, the appeal to a transcendental argument for the value of\nhumanity already counts as a markedly realist move (Larmore 2008: 121;\nWatkins & Fitzpatrick 2002; Fitzpatrick 2005; Tiffany 2006). The\nissue revolves around the nature of transcendental arguments, and\nwhether they commit us to moral realism, something that\nconstructivists deny.\n\nSecond, critics hold that the constructivist interpretation of Kant\nheavily rests its case on a text that contains seemingly realist\narguments. In the Critique of Practical Reason, Kant refers\nto our consciousness of the moral law as \u201cthe fact of\nreason\u201d (Kant C2 5: 46\u201348). We know the moral law\nas a \u201cfact\u201d, and we feel its pull in the guise of\nreverence for the law. This immediate consciousness of the moral law\nalso shows that we have an interest in morality, which arises\nindependently of self-interested motives (Kant C2 5:\n42\u201343). Realist interpreters take the argument from the fact of\nreason to show that Kant\u2019s claim about the objectivity of moral\nobligations ultimately relies on perception of some moral facts (the\nfact of reason), hence on a realist foundation (Ameriks 2003:\n263\u2013282; Kleingeld 2010: 55\u201372). By contrast,\nconstructivist interpreters tend to downplay the role of the fact of\nreason in Kant\u2019s general argument for the objectivity of moral\nobligations (O\u2019Neill 2002: 81\u201397; \u0141uk\u00f3w 1993:\n204\u2013221). Rawls takes the fact of reason to show that Kant\ndevelops \u201cnot only a constructivist conception of practical\nreason, but a coherentist account of its authentication\u201d (Rawls\n1999: 524; Rawls 2000: 268\u2013273). In his view, the fact of reason\nindicates that the deliverances of practical reason cohere with our\nmoral experience. This congruence is an integral part of Kant\u2019s\nvindication of ethical objectivity, but it is no commitment to\nrealism. Rather, it simply confirms that there is no discrepancy\nbetween the requirements of practical reason (which are expressed by\nthe Categorical Imperative) and our ordinary experience of morality\n(Rawls 1980: 340; Rawls 1989: 523\u2013524; Rawls 2000:\n253\u2013272, 268, 273; Kant C2, 5: 15). Rawls thinks that\nthe realist notion of objectivity is \u201cunnecessary for\nobjectivity\u201d (1980: 570). But Rawls\u2019 argument in support\nof a coherentist conception of practical reason may seem too weak to\ncapture Kant\u2019s view of moral obligations as objective rational\nrequirements (Larmore 2008: 83\u201384; Stern 2012a: 7\u201340). For\nthis reason, some interpreters argue that Kant is constructivist about\nthe authority of moral obligations and practical laws for finite\nagents, but not about the contents of such laws, which apply to all\nrational agents as such (Engstrom 2009, 2013; Bagnoli 2009; Sensen\n2013).\n\nUnderstanding this scholarly debate is important for assessing the\nprospects of constructivism, especially as a metaethical view distinct\nfrom realism (Bagnoli forthcoming: \u00a71). First, critics dispute\nthe force and the target of the objection of heteronomy. Some doubt\nthat \u2018moral realism\u2019 is Kant\u2019s own intended target,\nhence suggesting that Kant\u2019s constructivism does not build upon\na critique of moral realism (Stern 2012a: 7\u2013 68, 2012b).\nRelatedly, they deny that claims about the autonomy of reason or its\npractical function commit one to constructivism.\n\nThe constructivist interpretation is meant to capture Kant\u2019s\ndistinctive insights about practical reason and the\nself-authenticating nature of reason as a self-legislative activity.\nThe distinctive character of this conception resides in the idea that\nreason itself should be scrutinized by reason in order for its\nverdicts to be justified. Constructivists hold that practical reason\nitself is constructed in the sense that its legitimacy and authority\nare established by reasoning, rather than by appeal to some facts\nabout the way the world is (O\u2019Neill 1989b; Rawls 2000: 238;\nO\u2019Neill 2015; Bagnoli 2013b).\n\nContemporary constructivists have largely emphasized the\nantimetaphysical implications of Kant\u2019s views. Kant embarks on\nthe project of vindicating reasoning, starting from very modest\nconsiderations about rational agency. Such starting points are not\nsufficient \u201cto sustain or revive classical philosophical\nambitions to build vast metaphysical structures on reason alone\u201d\n(O\u2019Neill 2015: 3; C1: A xiii). The constructivist interpretation\nof Kant\u2019s ethics emphasizes the cooperative nature of the\nstandards of reasoning: \n\n\nKant\u2019s repeated use of metaphors of construction and\ncollaboration in his discussion of reasoning make it natural\nto speak of his approach and method as constructivist, and of\nhis aim as the construction of reason\u2019s authority, and\nthereby of a basis for offering others reasons for truth claims and\nmoral claims, reasons for favouring some rather than other practical\nand political aims. (O\u2019Neill 2015: 4) \n\n\nBasically, the standards of reasoning are justified by their function:\nthey must ensure that reasoning is followable by others, \u201cit\nmust exhibit patterns that others could discern, and thus it must be\nlaw-like\u201d (O\u2019Neill 2015: 4).\n",
