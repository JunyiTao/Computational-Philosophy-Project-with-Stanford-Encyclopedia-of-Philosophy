    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nPragmatics deals with utterances, by which we will mean\nspecific events, the intentional acts of speakers at times and places,\ntypically involving language. Logic and semantics traditionally deal\nwith properties of types of expressions, and not with\nproperties that differ from token to token, or use to use, or, as we\nshall say, from utterance to utterance, and vary with the particular\nproperties that differentiate them. Pragmatics is sometimes\ncharacterized as dealing with the effects of context. This is\nequivalent to saying it deals with utterances, if one collectively\nrefers to all the facts that can vary from utterance to utterance as\n\u2018context.\u2019 One must be careful, however, for the term is\noften used with more limited meanings.\n\nDifferent theorists have focused on different properties of\nutterances. To discuss them it will be helpful to make a distinction\nbetween \u2018near-side pragmatics\u2019 and \u2018far-side\npragmatics.\u2019 The picture is this. The utterances philosophers\nusually take as paradigmatic are assertive uses of declarative\nsentences, where the speaker says something. Near-side\npragmatics is concerned with the nature of certain facts that are\nrelevant to determining what is said. Far-side pragmatics is\nfocused on what happens beyond saying: what speech acts are\nperformed in or by saying what is said, or\nwhat implicatures (see below for an explanation of these\nterms) are generated by saying what is said.\n\nNear-side pragmatics includes, but is not limited to resolution of\nambiguity and vagueness, the reference of proper names, indexicals and\ndemonstratives, and anaphors, and at least some issues involving\npresupposition. In all of these cases facts about the utterance,\nbeyond the expressions used and their meanings, are needed.\n\nWe can divide these facts into several categories. For indexicals such\nas \u2018I,\u2019 \u2018now,\u2019 and \u2018here,\u2019 basic\nfacts about the utterance are required: the agent, and when and where\nit occurred. For other indexicals and demonstratives, speaker\nintentions are also relevant. While it seems the referent of\n\u2018you\u2019 must be a person addressed by the speaker, which of\nseveral possible addressees is referred to seems up to the\nspeaker\u2019s intentions. Within syntactic and semantic constraints,\nanaphoric relations seem largely a matter of speaker\u2019s intent.\nSpeaker\u2019s intentions and the way the speaker is connected to the\nwider world by causal/historical \u2018chains of reference\u2019 are\nrelevant to the reference of proper names.\n\nFar-side pragmatics deals with what we do with language,\nbeyond what we (literally) say. This is the conception\naccording to which Voltaire\u2019s remarks belong to pragmatics.\nIt\u2019s up to semantics to tell us what someone literally says when\nthey use expressions of a given type; it\u2019s up to pragmatics to\nexplain the information one conveys, and the actions one performs, in\nor by saying something.\n\nPragmatics is usually thought to involve a different sort of\nreasoning than semantics. Semantics consists of conventional\nrules of meaning for expressions and their modes of combination. Locke\nsupposed that communication was basically a matter of a speaker\nencoding thoughts into words and the listener decoding words back into\nthoughts. The same basic picture is found fairly explicitly in\nSaussure and other influential theorists. This picture seems to fit\nreasonably well with the picture that emerged from the logicians and\nphilosophers of language in the tradition of logical analysis, of\nlanguage as a system of phonological, syntactic and semantic rules, of\nwhich competent speakers and interpreters have implicit mastery.\nParadigmatically, the sincere speaker plans to produce an utterance\nwith the truth-conditions of a belief she wishes to express; she\nchooses her words so that her utterance has those truth-conditions;\nthe credulous interpreter needs to perceive the utterance, and\nrecognize which phones, morphemes, words and phrases are involved, and\nthen using knowledge of the meanings, deduce the truth-conditions of\nthe utterance and of the belief it expresses.\n\nIn contrast, pragmatics involves perception augmented by some species\nof \u2018ampliative\u2019 inference \u2014 induction, inference to\nthe best explanation, Bayesian reasoning, or perhaps some special\napplication of general principles special to communication, as\nconceived by Grice (see below) \u2014 but in any case a sort of\nreasoning that goes beyond the application of rules, and makes\ninferences beyond what is established by the basic facts about what\nexpressions are used and their meanings.\n\nThe facts with which pragmatics deals are of various sorts,\nincluding:\n\nFacts about the objective facts of the utterance, including: who\nthe speaker is, when the utterance occurred, and where;\nFacts about the speaker\u2019s intentions. On the near side, what\nlanguage the speaker intends to be using, what meaning she intends to\nbe using, whom she intends to refer to with various shared names,\nwhether a pronoun is used demonstratively or anaphorically, and the\nlike. On the far side, what she intends to achieve by saying what she\ndoes.\nFacts about beliefs of the speaker and those to whom she speaks,\nand the conversation they are engaged in; what beliefs do they share;\nwhat is the focus of the conversation, what are they talking about,\netc.\nFacts about relevant social institutions, such as promising,\nmarriage ceremonies, courtroom procedures, and the like, which affect\nwhat a person accomplishes in or by saying what she does.\n\n\nWe will divide our discussion, somewhat arbitrarily, into the\n\u2018Classic Pragmatics\u2019 and \u2018Contemporary\npragmatics.\u2019 The Classic Period, by our reckoning, stretches\nfrom the mid-sixties until the mid-eighties.\n",
