    "main_text": "Divine Inspiration || Phaedrus\n4. Imitation, Inspiration, Beauty\n\nMim\u00easis fails in two ways. 1) It originates in\nappearance rather than in reality, so that judged on its own terms the\nproduct of imitation has an ignoble pedigree (Republic 603b).\n2) The imitative arts positively direct a soul toward appearances,\naway from proper objects of inquiry. A mirror reflection might prompt\nyou to turn around and look at the thing being reflected; an imitation\nkeeps your eyes on the copy alone. Imitation has a base cause and\nbaser effects.\n\nAlthough the dialogues offer few arguments for the second claim, the\nperverseness with which mim\u00easis leads one to prefer\nappearance partly follows from a contrast between traditional visual\nart and its later developments. Aeschylus had, they say, already\npraised the religiosity of the rougher old visual forms, by comparison\nwith later visually exciting statues that inspired less of a sense of\ndivinity (Porphyry On Abstinence from Animal Food 2.18).\nEarly votive objects, sometimes no more representative than a plank or\noblong stone, were treated as markers of the gods\u2019 presence and points\nof contact with unseen powers (Faraone 1992, Collins 2003). Stone and\nwooden figures could serve as surrogates for absent humans, as when\nmourners buried an effigy in place of an irrecoverable body (Herodotus\nHistories 6.58; Vernant 2006, 322; Bremmer 2013), or treated\na grave marker as if it were the buried person (Euripides\nAlcestis 348\u2013356; see Burkert 1985, 193\u2013194).\nWhereas the mimetic relationship connects a visible likeness with its\nvisible original, such objects though visible link to invisible\nreferents.\n\nPlato seems to distinguish between the pious old art and its\nmodernized forms, as he distinguishes analogously among poems. Statues\nsuggest communication with divinities (Laws 931a,\nPhaedrus230b). Wax likenesses participate in the magic of\neffigies (Laws 933b). Metaphorically the dialogues imagine a\nbody as a statue that invites comparison with its invisible referent\nthe soul (Charmides 154c, 157d-158c; Symposium 215b,\n216d-e), or as a s\u00eama \u201ctomb\u201d but also\n\u201csign\u201d of the soul within (Cratylus 400b-c,\nGorgias 493a). Compared to such referential relations, the\nmimetic art object\u2019s reference to what is visible can feel like a\nforcible misdirection of attention to appearances and to delight with\nvisibility as such.\n\nBeauty by comparison begins in the domain of intelligible objects,\nsince there is a Form of beauty. And more than any other property for\nwhich a Form exists, beauty engages the soul and draws it toward\nphilosophical deliberation, toward thoughts of absolute beauty and\nsubsequently (as we imagine) toward thoughts of other concepts.\n\nPlato therefore hates to acknowledge that poems contain any beauty. He\ndoes not go so far as to call mim\u00easis beauty\u2019s\ncontrary, accusing poems or paintings of ugliness. He hardly could. It\nis bad enough for his view that he does not account for an imitative\npoem\u2019s appeal; to deny the appeal would rob his account of all\nplausibility.\n\nNor can a good (philosophical) version of imitation work as opposite\nto the poetic kind. Plato recognizes a salutary function that\nimitations sometimes have, even the function of drawing the mind\ntoward knowledge. But he offers no more than hints about positive\nmim\u00easis. There is no account of sound imitation that\nwould counterweigh the attacks in the Republic. In any case\nthis is a constructive turn that never seems to be made available to\npoems or paintings. If good imitation does exist, its home is not\namong the arts. Still the idea invites a worthwhile question: Is there\nanything human beings can produce that would function\noppositely to mimetic poetry? Inspiration is the most promising\npossibility.\n\nThe cause behind inspiration is unimpeachable, for it begins in the\ndivine realm. Is that a realm of Forms? The Phaedrus comes\nclosest to saying so, both by associating the gods with Forms\n(247c\u2013e), and by rooting inspired love in recollection (251a).\nBut this falls short of showing that the poets\u2019 divine madness\nlikewise originates among objects of greater reality. It might, but\ndoes not have to.\n\nThe Ion says less about poetry\u2019s divine origins than the\nPhaedrus, certainly nothing that requires an interpreter to\ndiscover Forms within the Muse\u2019s magnetism. Laws 682a and\nMeno 99c\u2013d credit the inspired condition with the\nproduction of truths, even in poetry. Neither passage describes the\ntruths about Forms that philosophical dialectic would lead to, but\nthat might be asking too much. Let it suffice that inspiration\noriginates in some truth.\n\nWhat about the effects of inspired poetry? Could such poetry\nturn a soul toward knowledge as beautiful faces do? Would it always do\nso? Poetry\u2019s defenders will find scant support for that proposal in\nthe dialogues. Inspired poetry has its merits but Plato rarely credits\nit with promoting philosophical knowledge. In fact the Ion\nconceives inspiration as the cause of the worst cognitive state, for\nthe poet\u2019s possession by the Muses is what attaches the audience\n(irrationally, particularly-minded) to that one poet. The\nPhaedrus does say that Muse-made poems teach future\ngenerations about the exploits of heroes. Inspired poetry at least\nmight set a good example. But one can find good examples in verse\nwithout waiting for inspiration. Even Republic 3 allows for\ninstances in which the young guardians imitate virtuous characters.\nThe educational consequences of inspired poetry do not set it apart\nfrom imitative poetry, and they never include philosophical\neducation.\n\nA clear opposition between imitation and inspiration, or any clear\nrelationship between them, would suggest a coherent whole that can be\ntitled \u201cPlato\u2019s aesthetics.\u201d In the absence of such a\nrelationship it is hard to attribute an aesthetic theory to Plato as\none can straightforwardly do with Aristotle.\n\nIf unification is possible for the elements of Plato\u2019s aesthetics,\nthat may arrive from another direction. Religion has not been explored\nas much as it should in connection with Plato\u2019s aesthetics, even\nthough a religious orientation informs what he has to say about\nbeauty, inspiration, and imitation. The quasi-divine status that\nbeauty has in the Symposium; the Republic\u2019s\ncharacterization of the imitator as enemy to Athena and other gods;\nand of course inspiration, which cannot be defined without appeal to\ndivine action: All three subjects suggest that Plato\u2019s aesthetics\nmight come together more satisfactorily within Plato\u2019s theology. The\nquestion is worth pursuing now, for scholarship of recent decades has\nadvanced the study of Greek religion, providing unprecedented\nresources for a fresh inquiry into the fundamental terms out of which\nPlato constructs his aesthetics.\n",
