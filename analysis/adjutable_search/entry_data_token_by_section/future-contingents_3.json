    "main_text": "The Solutions Based on Rejection of the Principle of Future Excluded Middle\n4. The Solutions Based on Rejection of the Principle of Future Excluded Middle\n\nA truth-theory may involve the rejection of the principle of future\nexcluded middle, (P5), for at least two different reasons:\n\nThe theory may imply that future contingents are neither true nor\nfalse, but undetermined (often conceived as a third truth-value).\nThe theory may be based on the idea that all future contingents\nare false.\n\n\nA possible third position would be to maintain that all future\ncontingents are true. Strictly speaking, such a claim does not\ncontradict (P5) as mentioned in section 2, although it does in fact\ncontradict a version of (P5) formulated in terms of an exclusive\ndisjunction. However, from a philosophical point of view, such a claim\nhas had no serious role to play in the debate, even though the\nassumption of all future contingents being true is in fact what holds\nin the early tense-logical systems, \\(\\mathrm{K}_t\\) and\n\\(\\mathrm{K}_b\\), introduced in (Prior 1967, p. 187) and in (Rescher\nand Urquhart, p. 68 ff.). The problem is that it is highly\ncounter-intuitive to accept both \u201cTomorrow there will be a\nsea-battle\u201d and \u201cTomorrow there will not be a\nsea-battle\u201d as true now. It seems that if one of these\npropositions is true now, then the other has to be false. On these\ngrounds, we shall not consider this possibility any further in this\ncontext.\n\nIn the two following subsections, we shall briefly consider some\nsolutions corresponding to the possibilities 1 and 2 mentioned\nabove.\n",
