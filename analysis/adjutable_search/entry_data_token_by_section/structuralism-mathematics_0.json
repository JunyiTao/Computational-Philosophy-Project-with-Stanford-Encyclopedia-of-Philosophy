    "main_text": "Eliminative vs. Non-Eliminative Structuralism || Beginnings of the Structuralism Debate in the 1960s\n1.1 Beginnings of the Structuralism Debate in the 1960s\n\nThe discussion of structuralism, as a major position in\nEnglish-speaking philosophy of mathematics, is usually taken to have\nstarted in the 1960s. A central article in this connection was Paul\nBenacerraf\u2019s \u201cWhat Numbers Could Not Be\u201d (1965; cf.\nalso Benacerraf 1996, a later follow-up). The background and foil for\nthis article was the position, dominant at the time, that axiomatic\nset theory provides the foundation for modern mathematics, including\nallowing us to identify all mathematical objects with sets. For\nexample, the natural numbers 0, 1, 2, \u2026 can be identified with\nthe finite von Neumann ordinals (starting with \\(\\emptyset\\) for 0 and\nusing the successor function \\(f: x \\rightarrow x\\cup \\{x\\})\\);\nsimilarly, the real numbers can be identified with Dedekind cuts\nconstructed set-theoretically. Arithmetic truths are then \ntruths about these set-theoretic objects; and this generalizes \nto other mathematical theories, all of whose objects are\ntaken to be sets as well.\n\nAccording to Benacerraf, such a set-theoretic foundationalist position\nmisrepresents the structuralist character of arithmetic in particular\nand of mathematics more generally. To begin with, instead of working\nwith the finite von Neumann ordinals, we can equally well work with\nthe finite Zermelo ordinals (starting again with \\(\\emptyset\\) for 0\nbut using the alternative successor function \\(f: x \\rightarrow\n\\{x\\})\\); and there are infinitely many other choices that are\nequivalent. Similarly, instead of working with a set-theoretic\nconstruction of the real numbers in terms of Dedekind cuts, we can\nwork with a construction based on equivalence classes of Cauchy\nsequences on the rational numbers as suggested by Cantor and\nothers. This basic observation is hard to deny, and even set-theorist\nfoundationalists can agree with it (more on that below). But\nBenacerraf draws some further, more controversial conclusions from\nthis basic observation. \n\nBenacerraf argues, in particular, that the natural numbers should not\nbe identified with any set-theoretic objects; in fact, they should not\nbe taken to be objects at all. Instead, numbers should be treated as\n\u201cpositions in structures\u201d, e.g., in \u201cthe natural\nnumber structure\u201d, \u201cthe real number structure\u201d,\netc. All that matters about such positions are their structural\nproperties, i.e., those \u201cstem[ming] from the relations they bear\nto one another in virtue of being arranged in a progression\u201d\n(1965: 70), as opposed to further set-theoretic properties of the von\nNeumann ordinals, Dedekind cuts, etc. What we study and try to\ncharacterize in modern mathematics, along such lines, are the\ncorresponding \u201cabstract structures\u201d. It is in this sense\nthat Benacerraf suggests a structuralist position concerning\nmathematics. The details of the position are left open and somewhat\nvague, however, including how we should think about Benacerraf\u2019s\nabstract structures in the end, except that they are not to be\nidentified with set-theoretic relational systems (consisting of sets\nas domains, with set-theoretic relations and functions defined on\nthem). \n\nA second article from the 1960s that was influential in the rise of\nstructuralism is Hilary Putnam\u2019s \u201cMathematics without\nFoundations\u201d (1967). Like in Benacerraf\u2019s case, for Putnam\nthe foil was a set-theoretic foundationalist position. This position\nis sometimes, although not always, understood in a realist sense\n(e.g., by G\u00f6del), i.e., as the description of an independent\nrealm of abstract objects, namely the universe of sets characterized\nby the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms. In opposition to that position, Putnam\nsuggests a form of \u201cif-then-ism\u201d (which can be traced back\nto Russell).  That alternative can again be illustrated in terms of\nthe natural numbers. How should an arithmetic theorem, say\n\u201c\\(2+3=5\\)\u201d, \nbe understood now? It should be analyzed as having this form: \n\n\n\nFor all relational systems M, if M is a model of the\nDedekind-Peano axioms [the basic axioms for arithmetic], then \\[2_M\n+3_M =5_M\\]\n\n \n\n\n(where \\(2_M\\), \\(3_M\\), and \\(5_M\\) are what \u201cplay the\nroles\u201d of 2, 3, and 5 in the model M). Similarly for the\nreal numbers (see Reck & Price 2000 for details).\n\nInstead of talking about if-then-ism in this connection, one can\ndescribe Putnam\u2019s position also as a kind of \u201cuniversalist\nstructuralism\u201d (see again Reck & Price 2000), since it\ninvolves universal quantification over relevant systems and since our\ntwo structuralist slogans above seem satisfied.  Often an objection to\nthis position is the \u201cnon-vacuity problem\u201d. It is based on\nthe observation that if-then statements of the given form are\nvacuously true if there is nothing that satisfies the antecedent,\ne.g., if there is no model of the Dedekind-Peano axioms. (As this\nwould also be the case for, say, \u201c\\(2+3=6\\)\u201d, the overall\nresult is clearly not desirable.) In response, one can invoke\naxiomatic set theory as providing the needed models.  But from\nPutnam\u2019s point of view this has two drawbacks: First, it relies\non a realist and foundationalist view about set theory, it would seem,\nthus undermining the thrust of if-then-ism. Second and more basically,\nit forces us to treat set theory differently from other mathematical\ntheories, on pain of circularity. As a way out of these dilemmas,\nPutnam suggests to employ modal logic. However, the details are again\nleft open and largely unexplored, especially for the case of set\ntheory.\n",
