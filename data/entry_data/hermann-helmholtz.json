Theory of Perception\n\nHelmholtz\u2019s earliest study of physiology was with Johannes\nM\u00fcller. M\u00fcller (1801\u20131858) was a keen experimenter and\nnaturalist along the lines of Ernst Haeckel and Alexander von\nHumboldt, sailing to the tropics to find specimens for his studies\n(Otis 2007, 6\u201314). Early in his career, M\u00fcller was also a\nproponent of Schelling\u2019s Naturphilosophie.\nNaturphilosophie took its cue from what Schelling took to be\nKant\u2019s assertion that, while each part of an organism supported\nthe whole, the only purpose of a living organism was itself.\n\u201cM\u00fcller\u2019s enormously influential Handbook of\nHuman Physiology, written and rewritten between 1833 and 1844,\nshows his simultaneous commitments to vitalism, philosophy, and\nrigorous science\u201d (Otis 2007, 21).\n\nAccording to the \u201cprojection\u201d theory of the physiology of\nperception, a stimulus causes its response directly. That is, our\nnerves are malleable, like wax, and the objects \u201cproject\u201d\nsignals onto the nerves directly, like a key pressed into the wax.\nBased on experiments in his laboratory, and on the phenomena of\nbinocular vision revealed by the stereoscope Charles Wheatstone\ninvented in the 1830s, M\u00fcller observed that several phenomena of\nthe physiology of perception contradict the projection theory. One\nsuch phenomenon is stereoscopic binocular vision, in which the two\nimages on our retinas are resolved into one image, the image we see.\nIf images are projected directly onto the sense nerves, M\u00fcller\nasked, then how is stereoscopic vision possible? M\u00fcller also\ncited the fact that images from objects are projected onto the retina\nupside down, but we see them as right side up. The projection theory\nhas no explanation of these effects.\n\nIn response to experimental data, M\u00fcller constructed the\n\u201claw of specific sense energies\u201d\n[Sinnesenergien]. M\u00fcller argued that each nerve is\nconfigured to receive a specific range of signals, as a radio is tuned\nto receive sound on a certain wavelength (of course, M\u00fcller did\nnot use this analogy). M\u00fcller called the configuration a\n\u201cspecific sense energy.\u201d M\u00fcller explained\nstereoscopic vision by arguing that each retina is able to perceive\nitself, that is, to perceive a priori the manifold, or grid, of points\nthat can be projected onto the retina. M\u00fcller hypothesized that\nthere was an organic correlation between the left and the right\nretinas of the eye (M\u00fcller 1837\u20131840, 2: 351\u2013385, see\nalso Turner 1993, 159\u2013160). Each point on the left retina is\nindexed to one and only one point on the right retina. M\u00fcller\nargues that for each point seen in stereoscopic vision, the two\nsignals from the corresponding points on the two retinas are projected\nonto a single point.\n\nM\u00fcller\u2019s explanation appeals to an a priori perception of\nthe retina by itself, and to the activity of projecting two points\nonto a theoretical projection surface a priori. M\u00fcller tries to\nuse Kantian philosophy to support his theory, arguing that by the\n\u201cmanifold accessible to pure intuition\u201d Kant meant, or\ncould have meant, the a priori possible manifold of physical points\nthat could be perceived by the retina. Robert DiSalle presents\nevidence that this view is not Kantian (DiSalle 1993, 502ff).\n\nFrom 1838 to 1842, Helmholtz studied medicine under M\u00fcller. From\n1842 to 1848, while working as an army surgeon in Potsdam, Helmholtz\nmade many trips to Berlin to work in Gustav Magnus\u2019s library.\nDuring these trips, Helmholtz stayed in contact with fellow students\nof M\u00fcller\u2019s he had met while working in M\u00fcller\u2019s\nlaboratory, Emil du Bois-Reymond and Ernst Br\u00fccke. In 1845,\nHelmholtz joined the Berlin Physical Society, which was founded by du\nBois-Reymond and also counted among its members Br\u00fccke and Werner\nvon Siemens. Du Bois-Reymond founded the Physical Society to support\nexperiment and to banish vitalism from scientific research. For more\non Helmholtz\u2019s early career and relationship with the Physical\nSociety, see Sulloway 1992, 14ff and 65ff, and Cahan 2012.\n\nWhile Helmholtz did not contradict M\u00fcller by name in his writings\non physiology, Helmholtz\u2019s research, in M\u00fcller\u2019s and\nMagnus\u2019s labs and later in his own labs in Bonn and\nK\u00f6nigsberg, is in conflict with the doctrine of specific sense\nenergies (see Otis 2007, 129\u2013130). Helmholtz proposes a\n\u201csign\u201d theory, according to which sensations symbolize\ntheir stimuli, but are not direct copies of those stimuli. While\nM\u00fcller explains the correspondence between sensation and object\nby means of an innate configuration of sense nerves, Helmholtz argues\nthat we construct that correspondence by means of a series of learned,\n\u201cunconscious inferences.\u201d\n\nIn his sign theory of perception as expressed in his early career\n(1848\u20131868), Helmholtz argues that the mind makes a series of\nmental adjustments, \u201cunconscious inferences,\u201d to construct\na coherent picture of its experiences. Helmholtz argues that spatial\nposition, often used as a criterion to individuate objects, is an\ninterpretation of our sensations, and not their immediate result.\nAgain, stereoscopic vision shows that what may appear, to us, as a\nsingle image is in fact two images resolved into one. Perspective can\ndistort size, as when one puts a finger in front of the moon.\nHelmholtz believes that we learn how to interpret spatial concepts\nthrough experience, which means that he has what he calls an empirical\ntheory of spatial perception. This theory coexists, in\nHelmholtz\u2019s epistemology, with his above commitment to the sign\ntheory, according to which spatial properties are only properties of\nrepresentations. Helmholtz\u2019s invention of the ophthalmoscope in\n1850\u20131851 contributed to his understanding of the physiology of\nperception (Schett 1999; for images of the original Helmholtz\nophthalmoscope see De Schweinitz and Randall 1899, 172ff).\nPhilosophically, Helmholtz\u2019s epistemology commits him to the\nview that representations arise in a physical process, but are signs\nand not copies of their objects.\n\nHelmholtz was inspired by the theory of\n Hermann Lotze\n (1817\u20131881) in his explanation of these phenomena. For Lotze,\nHelmholtz observes, \u201cto the sensations from spatially distinct\nnerve endings correspond various determinate Localzeichen\n[literally: place signs], whose spatial meaning is learned\u201d\n(Helmholtz 1968 [1869], 57). My various sensations of my finger are\noriginally unrelated, but I can relate them to each other by means of\nthe concept \u201cmy finger,\u201d which serves as a mental\nLocalzeichen that contains the data of all the sensations.\nThe space of perception is a general Localzeichen that\nrelates all possible sensations to each other. The usefulness of\nLotze\u2019s theory is that all psychological sensations are mapped\ndirectly onto mental concepts, and even space becomes a tool for\nconstructing an interpretation of sense-data, akin to a language.\n\nAccording to Helmholtz\u2019s explanations of the physiology of\nperception, the qualities of sensations \u201cbelong only to our\nnervous system,\u201d and we acquire our knowledge of spatial\nordering through perceiving an unchanging sequence of sense\nimpressions of the same object:\n\nIt is easy to see that by moving our fingers over an object, we can\nlearn the sequences in which impressions of it present themselves and\nthat these sequences are unchanging, regardless which finger we use.\nIt is thus that our knowledge of the spatial arrangement of objects is\nattained. Judgments concerning their size result from observations of\nthe congruence of our hand with parts or points of an object\u2019s\nsurface, or from the congruence of the retina with parts or points of\nthe retinal image. A strange consequence, characteristic of the ideas\nin the minds of individuals with at least some experience, follows\nfrom the fact that the perceived spatial ordering of things originates\nin the sequences in which the qualities of sensations are presented by\nour moving sense organs: the objects in the space around us appear to\npossess the qualities of our sensations. They appear to be red or\ngreen, cold or warm, to have an odour or a taste, and so on. Yet these\nqualities of sensations belong only to our nervous system and do not\nextend at all into the space around us. Even when we know this,\nhowever, the illusion does not cease, for it is the primary and\nfundamental truth. The illusion is quite simply the sensations which\nare given to us in spatial order to begin with (Helmholtz 1971 [1878],\n376\u20137).\n\n\nAs a concrete example of a judgment of relative spatial position,\nHelmholtz gives the case of someone grasping a pen in her fingers. She\ncannot infer directly from the sensation of the pen that it is in one\nplace, because each finger feels only the position of the pen relative\nto the finger itself. She would have exactly the same sensations if\nher fingers were touching two or three different pens, separated in\nspace. The belief that the pen is in one place only is based on her\nknowledge that his fingers are close enough together that only one pen\nwill fit between them. As Helmholtz remarks,\n\nWhen two different parts of the skin are touched at the same time, two\ndifferent sensitive nerves are excited, but the local separation\nbetween these two nerves is not a sufficient ground for our\nrecognition of the two parts which have been touched as distinct, and\nfor the conception of two different external objects which follows.\nIndeed, this conception will vary according to circumstances. If we\ntouch the table with two fingers, and feel under each a grain of sand,\nwe suppose that there are two separate grains of sand; but if we place\ntwo fingers one against the other, and a grain of sand between them,\nwe may have the same sensations of touch in the same two nerves as\nbefore, and yet, under these circumstances, we suppose that there is\nonly a single grain. In this case, our consciousness of the position\nof the fingers has obviously an influence upon the result at which the\nmind arrives\u2026 What, then, is it which comes to help the\nanatomical distinction in locality between the different sensitive\nnerves, and, in cases like those I have mentioned, produces the notion\nof separation in space? (Helmholtz 1995 [1868], 175\u20136)\n\n\nHelmholtz argues that perceived properties such as separation in space\nare well-founded inferences from two sources of knowledge: our\nexperience, and the properties of our sense organs. For Helmholtz,\nknowledge of the way our physiology works in perception is essential\nto any epistemological account of spatial properties. Helmholtz argues\nthat the more we know about the physiology of perception, the more\naccurate our inferences about our experience will be. In the case of a\nperson grasping a pen or touching a grain of sand, Helmholtz argues\nthat we become aware that the object touched is a single object by\nstudying the position of our sense organs: the nerve endings in our\nfingers, in this case. Our awareness of distinction of spatial\nposition, necessary for depth perception and perception of distance,\nis learned and not innate. Lenoir (2006) is a rich history of\nHelmholtz\u2019s influences on this score, including Johann Herbart,\nWilhelm Wundt, Carl Friedrich Gauss, and an analysis of\nHelmholtz\u2019s theory of perception as\n\u201coperationalizing\u201d the Kantian view.\n\nIn Helmholtz\u2019s early work, and in some later essays, perceptual\nspace is a mental generalization of our orientation with respect to\nobjects in space. We learn the general properties of space by\ndiscovering what spatial properties do not change when objects move,\nand when we move relative to the objects. The insight that the\nspatially relevant properties of objects are the properties that\nremain invariant when objects change position, or when we change\nposition relative to the objects, is fundamental to Helmholtz\u2019s\nlater work on topology.\n\nIn the third part of Helmholtz\u2019s Handbook of Physiological\nOptics, Helmholtz draws a distinction between nativism and\nempiricism in the physiology of perception. In drawing up the\nHandbook, Helmholtz\u2019s \u201ctask was to survey the\nfield of physiological optics for the purpose of writing a work that\nwould appear as volume nine of Karsten\u2019s Encyklop\u00e4die\nder Physik. The format of the Karsten series dictated that\nHelmholtz provide a thorough review of both past and present work, a\ntask he performed diligently. Wishing to provide a systematic\ntheoretical framework for his survey of the field, Helmholtz divided\nthe major theoretical positions with respect to spatial perception\ninto two groups, which he characterized with the adjectives\nempiristisch and nativistisch\u201d (Hatfield 1991,\n274\u2013275. I follow Hatfield in translating the term\n\u201cempirismus\u201d as \u201cempirism.\u201d). Turner (1993)\nhas argued that Helmholtz\u2019s empirism was pragmatic \u2013 that\nHelmholtz adopted an empirist stance to meet the challenges of\n\u201cimposing order on a chaotic new field of investigation\u201d\nand of defending his stance in his lifelong debate with Ewald Hering\n(Turner 1993,155).\n\nSignificant questions in the empirism \u2013 nativism debate include\nhow to explain perception of depth and relief (Turner 1993, 156). The\n\u201cprojection\u201d theory explained relief perception by\nclaiming that the mind interprets visual cues to construct a combined,\nrelief picture out of two flat pictures provided by the eyes (Turner\n1993, 158). By 1867, when Helmholtz published his Handbook of\nPhysiological Optics, Helmholtz had developed his\n\u201csign\u201d theory, according to which the brain\u2019s\nconstruction of phenomena such as depth and separation in space is\nlearned. This account brought Helmholtz into conflict with Hering.\n\nNativism [Hering\u2019s account] is the view that at birth (or\nsometime thereafter, depending upon the ontogenetic timetable) the\norganism, upon visual stimulation, will experience a spatially\norganized array of colored areas. The key notion is that the\ndisposition to have spatially organized visual experience is inborn\nand does not depend upon a process of learning. A nativist need not\nassert that an innately endowed organism will be visually competent at\nbirth, for the visual system might become functional only after a\nfurther period of maturation. Empirism [Helmholtz\u2019s account] is\nthe view that at least some of the spatial organization found in the\nvisual experience of the adult is the result of learning; it asserts\nthat some or all of the ability to perceive a spatially organized\nvisual world is acquired (Hatfield 1991, 276).\n\n\nThe debate between Helmholtz and Hering focused on several specific\ncases, in particular, how to account for the so-called\n\u201choropter\u201d problem. The horopter is the set of points that\nthe eye perceives as equidistant from the perceiving subject when the\neye is focusing on a single point. The eye perceives points on the\nhoropter as if they were lying on a straight line at a fixed distance\nfrom the eye. However, in reality the horopter line is a curve, that\nis, in reality the points are not equally distant from the eye.\n\nWhen looking at a single object, some points on the object stimulate\nboth eyes, but some points stimulate only the right or the left eye.\nThe brain resolves these common and distinct stimuli into a single\nimage (Hershenson 1999, 29\u201330). The fact that the brain must\nresolve two distinct images into one accounts for the horopter effect.\nWhen the eyes are focusing on a single point, the left and the right\neyes give different inputs to the brain about objects to the left or\nright of the point of focus. The brain corrects for the different\ninputs coming from the left and the right eyes by representing them as\nequally distant from the eyes as the object of focus.\n\nHering and Helmholtz disagree, not about the empirical results or the\nconcept of the horopter itself, but about how to explain the\nbrain\u2019s resolution of two images into one. Helmholtz argues that\nthe brain adjusts the retinal images by a process of\n\u201cunconscious inferences.\u201d Helmholtz contends that a\nchild\u2019s brain learns to respond to stimuli as the child\ndevelops, and that the brain unconsciously adjusts itself to produce a\ncoherent experience \u2014 for instance, to resolve retinal\ndisparities. For recent work on unconscious inference see De Kock\n2014a, De Kock 2014b, Patton 2018, Patton 2019.\n\nHering argues that the ability to experience objects as a single,\nspatially ordered image is a disposition inborn in human children, and\nnot acquired. While children may not be born with the ability to\nresolve two images into one, Hering claims that the ability develops\nwhen a child grows to maturity, and is not learned. Hering argues that\ndepth perception and stereoscopic vision are inherent physical\nabilities, like running or even breathing, that can be honed but are\nnot learned wholesale from experience. In fact, to Hering, the\nadjustments the brain and eyes make to different inputs are automatic\nand involuntary, like a heartbeat. Helmholtz contends that depth\nperception and stereoscopic vision require reciprocal adjustment to\nobjects and thus are skills that must be learned through experience,\nlike shaving in front of a mirror (an example he takes from\nM\u00fcller, see Otis 2007, 129). When shaving in front of a mirror,\none must learn to distinguish right from left in the mirror, and to\nturn the right or left side of one\u2019s face to the mirror\ncorrectly, even though the apparent motion in the mirror is the\nopposite of the felt motion in one\u2019s body. Helmholtz argues that\nthe ability to shave in front of a mirror cannot be innate, because it\nrequires learned adjustments to the properties of one\u2019s\nenvironment, that reflections in a mirror are inverted, for\ninstance.\n\nPatton (2022) argues that the Helmholtz-Hering debate \u201crevealed\ndeep fissures in nineteenth century accounts of scientific\nexplanation, as well as in the conception of how physiology,\npsychology, physics, and philosophy are related\u201d: \u201cHering\nwas a pioneer of Lamarckian explanations, arguing for an early version\nof the biogenetic law. Hering explains physical processes, including\nperception, in terms of \u2018organic memory\u2019 that is supported\nby \u2018vital forces\u2019 located throughout the body. Helmholtz,\non the other hand, argues that vital forces are in direct conflict\nwith the results he and others proved in the 1840s and 50s on the\nconservation of force.\u201d \n\nOtis (2007) and Turner (1993) argue that the most significant\ndifference between Hering and Helmholtz is not in their distinct\nexplanations of the empirical evidence. Rather, the difference is in\nthe epistemological consequences of their higher-order commitments. If\nHelmholtz is right, then our access to objective properties is not\ndirect, but constructed. In his early \u201csign\u201d theory,\nHelmholtz argues that perceptions of objects are not impressions like\nthe imprint of a key on wax, but are symbols or signs of their\nobjects, as a name is a symbol of a person. For Helmholtz, the degree\nof resemblance between perception and object may be as remote as the\ndegree of resemblance between a written name and the physical person\nto whom the name refers (Helmholtz 1882, 2:608, Helmholtz 1903,\n1:41ff; cited in Schiemann 1998, 26). Hering objects strenuously to\nthese epistemological consequences of Helmholtz\u2019s sign theory,\nand argues that we have direct access to real objects in\nperception.\n\nThere is significant debate over the question of how far\nHelmholtz\u2019s theory was influenced by Kantianism. David Galaty,\nNicholas Pastore, and David Leary have argued that Helmholtz was\nKantian in his approach (Galaty 1971, 159\u201366; Pastore 1978,\n355\u201376; and Leary 1982, 36; cited in Hatfield 1991, 325). As\nMichael Heidelberger has observed recently, the Neo-Kantian Alois\nRiehl refers to Kant as a \u201cman of the physiologists,\u201d and\nRiehl refers to Helmholtz\u2019s \u201cKantian understanding of\nsensory perception,\u201d although Heidelberger himself may not read\nHelmholtz as a Kantian (Riehl 1876, v and 5; Heidelberger 2007, 30).\nGary Hatfield and Edwin Boring have argued that Helmholtz\u2019s\nempiricism outweighs his Kantianism. Boring\u2019s classic history of\npsychology inaugurated the contemporary reading of Helmholtz as an\nempiricist or empirist (Boring 1942, chapter 15). Hatfield argues\nthat, while Helmholtz maintained some Kantian doctrines for a time,\nhis mature view departs from Kantianism (Hatfield 1991,\n325\u2013326), and Lenoir concurs (2006, 200\u2013204). In a 1918\narticle, the Marburg Neo-Kantian Ernst Cassirer supports this mixed\nreading of Helmholtz. According to Cassirer, although\nHelmholtz\u2019s view was \u201clinked deliberately to Kant,\u201d\nand Helmholtz was very influential in the origins of Neo-Kantianism,\nHelmholtz made the a priori dependent on the results of natural\nscience, a significant departure from Kantianism (Cassirer 2005\n[1918], 96). Edgar (2018) addresses the broader question of the place\nof Helmholtz in the neo-Kantian tradition.\n\nOne area of debate centers on the influence of Johann Gottlieb Fichte\non Helmholtz\u2019s work. Heidelberger (1995) and De Kock (2018)\nemphasize the influence of Fichtean idealist philosophy on Helmholtz,\nnoting, for instance, that Fichte\u2019s distinction between the\n\u201cI\u201d and the \u201cnot-I\u201d is employed in\nHelmholtz\u2019s analysis of perceptual experience and in the\ndistinction between subjectivity and objectivity. Hatfield (2018)\nresponds that Helmholtz \u201crejected Fichtean idealism\u201d and\nwas influenced more profoundly by empirical physiologists of\nperception, including M\u00fcller and Wundt but also Johann Georg\nSteinbuch and Caspar Theobald Tourtual. Hatfield argues that\nHelmholtz\u2019s view in 1867 is better understood as \u201ca form\nof modest realism, a kind of structural realism\u201d avant la\nlettre, \u201cand that, in 1878, he consolidated this position in a\nway that renders it metaphysical\u201d (2018, 33).\n\nSwanson (2016) has argued that the \u2018predictive processing\u2019\nparadigm in contemporary cognitive and computational neuroscience has\nroots in Kant and Helmholtz. Predictive processing means\n\u201cperception involves the use of a unified body of acquired\nknowledge (a multi-level \u2018generative model\u2019) to predict\nthe incoming sensory barrage\u201d (Clark 2015). As Swanson notes,\n\u201cThe current PP paradigm emerged from early work on generative\nmodels, and this work explicitly identifies itself as being directly\ninspired by \u2026 Hermann von Helmholtz \u2026 For example, the\nseminal article on the use of generative models in machine perception,\ntitled \u2018The Helmholtz Machine,\u2019 states that\n\u2018Following Helmholtz, we view the human perceptual system as a\nstatistical inference engine whose function is to infer the probable\ncauses of sensory input\u2019\u201d (Swanson 2016, 10; Dayan et al.,\n1995, 89).\n\nTracz (2018) defends a reading that Helmholtz is a relationalist about\nperceptual properties, drawing on a related argument from Allais\n(2015) that transcendental idealism is a form of relationalism.\n\u201cHelmholtz\u2019s relationalism should be of interest to\nreaders of Kant, for according to one of the main strands of\ninterpretation, Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism treats all\nproperties that appear in perception as relational properties\u201d\n(2018, 65). Moreover, \u201crelationalism, particularly color\nrelationalism, is alive in contemporary philosophy of perception\n(e.g., Chirimuuta 2015, Cohen 2009). Despite this, the history of\nrelationalism is rarely thematized, so Helmholtz\u2019s views provide\nsome historical context of interest to present work in philosophy of\nperception\u201d (Tracz 2018, 65). Patton (2019, 73) adds that\n\nWhile the relationalist reading of Helmholtz is certainly defensible,\nit is not the end of the story: restricting ourselves to an argument\naccording to which Helmholtz only is defending contemporary\nrelationalism would risk losing some of the force and complexity of\nHelmholtz\u2019s view\u2026 for Helmholtz, habit and\ninference \u2013 and even deliberate interference \u2013\ncan change the relational properties involved, and thus change my\nperceptual experience\u2026 for Helmholtz, Fechner, and Weber,\nperceptual experience of complex phenomena like music and colored\nobjects is not reducible to the ground-level sensory response to\nphysical stimuli. (Patton 2019, 73)\n\n\nGiulio\u00a0Peruzzi and Valentina Roberti (2023) nominate Helmholtz as\none of the \u201cchief architects of the new color theory\u201d, who\ndefined \u201cthe first non-Euclidean line element in color space,\ni.e., a three-dimensional mathematical model used to describe color\ndifferences in terms of color distances\u201d. Hyder (2009), Turner\n(1996), and Kremer (1993) trace Helmholtz\u2019s engagement with the\nwork of James Clerk Maxwell and Hermann Grassmann on color. \n3. The geometry of physical space and topology\n\nEven when he was writing about physiology, Helmholtz\u2019s vocation\nas a mathematical physicist was apparent. Helmholtz used mathematical\nreasoning to support his arguments for the sign theory, rather than\nexclusively philosophical or empirical evidence. Throughout his\ncareer, Helmholtz\u2019s work is marked by two preoccupations:\nconcrete examples and mathematical reasoning. Helmholtz\u2019s early\nwork in physiology of perception gave him concrete examples of how\nhumans perceive spatial relations between objects. These examples\nwould prove useful to illustrate the relationship between metric\ngeometry and the spatial relations between objects of perception.\nLater, Helmholtz used his experience with the concrete science of\nhuman perception to pose a problem for the Riemannian approach to\ngeometry.\n\nHelmholtz\u2019s work on geometry was made public from 1868, the year\nhe gave a lecture, \u201cOn the Actual Foundations of\nGeometry,\u201d in Heidelberg, and published his \u201cOn the Facts\nUnderlying Geometry.\u201d The latter \u201castonished\u201d the\nacademic public, who had considered Helmholtz primarily an\nexperimental scientist and physiologist (K\u00f6nigsberger 1906, 254).\nHowever, Helmholtz had initially wanted to be a physicist, and had\nalways been alive to the mathematical consequences of his work in\nphysiology. Riemann\u2019s work revolutionized mathematics and\nphysics, and philosophy by extension, and Helmholtz was perhaps the\nfirst to recognize the extent of the revolution. Indeed, Helmholtz\nclaimed that he had come to results similar to Riemann\u2019s, though\nperhaps slightly later. Although the publication of Riemann\u2019s\nHabilitationsrede, \u201cOn the Hypotheses Underlying\nGeometry,\u201d meant that Helmholtz\u2019s own results would not be\nseen as original, Helmholtz says in his own essay that he is content\nthat \u201cso distinguished a mathematician [as Riemann] should have\nconsidered these questions as worthy of his attention\u201d\n(Helmholtz 1883 [1868], cited in K\u00f6nigsberger 261). With his 1868\nessay, Helmholtz saw himself as contributing to the Riemannian\napproach to the foundations of geometry (K\u00f6nigsberger 1906, 254).\nHelmholtz\u2019s title, \u201cOn the Facts Underlying\nGeometry,\u201d is a deliberate echo of Riemann\u2019s \u201cOn the\nHypotheses Underlying Geometry.\u201d The difference in the titles,\nfacts versus hypotheses, underscores the fact that while\nHelmholtz\u2019s approach is very similar to Riemann\u2019s, there\nis at least one significant difference.\n\nIn \u201cOn the Hypotheses Underlying Geometry,\u201d Riemann\nfocuses on how to determine the overall topological properties of\nspace. Topological properties are those spatial properties of figures\nthat are invariant under transformation, that is, that stay the same\nwhen the figures move. Riemann proves that a space of n dimensions,\nthat is, a space determined by n continuously and independently\nvarying magnitudes, has constant curvature, but only under the\nhypothesis that all spatial figures can be moved or rotated anywhere\nin space without changing their form, the so-called \u201cAxiom of\nFree Mobility\u201d (cf. K\u00f6nigsberger 1906, 260\u2013261). For\nthe case of astronomy, Riemann observes:\n\nIf one assumes that bodies exist independently of place, then the\nmeasure of curvature is constant overall, and then it follows from\nastronomical measurements that the measure of curvature cannot be\ndistinguished from null\u2026 However, if bodies are not independent\nof place, then one cannot deduce infinitely small mass relationships\nfrom the relationships between large masses. In that case, between any\ngiven points in three dimensions the measure of curvature can have any\nrandom value, provided that the entire curvature of any measurable\npart of space is not distinguishable from null (Riemann 1892 [1854],\n285, my translation).\n\n\nThe assumption \u201cthat bodies exist independently of place\u201d\nis valid if and only if the properties of bodies remain invariant when\nmoved. That is, if a body changes place, that is a movement, and if\nthe body continues to have the same properties in any different place,\nthen its properties are invariant under transformation. Riemann goes\non to say that, without this assumption, the units of comparison that\nare the basis for astronomical and other measurements \u2014 rays of\nlight as the shortest path between two points, rigid bodies like meter\nsticks as the basis of distance measurement \u2014 no longer have the\ninvariant properties on which one can base valid measurements.\n\nIn \u201cOn the Facts Underlying Geometry,\u201d Helmholtz\ninvestigates a related, but distinct question. He agrees with Riemann\nthat geometry is not possible unless we can compare figures to each\nother and measure them, and that measurement is not possible unless at\nleast some properties of the figures we are measuring do not change\nwhen the figures move. Helmholtz asks, what are the most general\naxioms of geometry that must hold for such motions, motions preserving\nthe spatial properties of figures, to be possible?\n\nHelmholtz presents the idea of \u201crigid motions\u201d to account\nfor these invariant properties. \u201cRigid motions\u201d are those\nmotions that preserve a set of properties of the objects. For\ninstance, when a sphere rotates around its central vertical axis, that\nmotion preserves the sphere\u2019s symmetries about the x and y axes,\nand thus these symmetries are invariant under that particular\ntransformation (rotation). A given object may have a group of\nproperties that remain invariant under transformation and a group that\nchange, that is, when objects move in a certain way they may stretch\nor lose symmetry about an axis. After the publication of\nHelmholtz\u2019s work, Sophus Lie argued that rigid motions form\ngroups, and described the set of rigid motions in the mathematical\nterms of group theory.\n\nWhile Riemann tries to describe the general properties of space,\nHelmholtz asks what the most general geometrical axioms are that can\naccount for our empirical measurement of objects. These will be the\naxioms that preserve observed rigid motions, given an underlying\nsystem of geometry. Helmholtz investigates the question of which\nsystems of geometry (Euclidean, Lobachevskian, and Riemannian) are\npossible under which assumptions. Here Helmholtz makes an initial\nmistake, and argues that only Euclidean geometry can account for our\nactual physical measurements. In April 1869, Eugenio Beltrami pointed\nout in a letter to Helmholtz that Lobachevskian geometry could be\nadequate to the task under the assumption that we live in a\n\u201cpseudosphere\u201d (see Other Internet Resources). Helmholtz\nconcedes the point immediately (K\u00f6nigsberger 1906, 263). In 1870,\nin \u201cOn the Origin and Significance of the Axioms of\nGeometry,\u201d Helmholtz investigates in much closer detail the\nquestion of whether non-Euclidean geometries can be visualized. This\nessay, perhaps even more than \u201cOn the Facts Underlying\nGeometry,\u201d was widely influential. Moritz Schlick and Hans\nReichenbach engaged with Helmholtz\u2019s views in the 1870 essay\n(see, e.g., Reichenbach 1920, Schlick\u2019s notes to Helmholtz\n1921). A related article, \u201cThe Origin and Meaning of Geometrical\nAxioms,\u201d was published in Mind in 1878, and Russell\nresponds to it in his doctoral dissertation.\n\nIn Space, Number, and Geometry from Helmholtz to Cassirer,\nFrancesca Biagioli (2016) analyzes Helmholtz\u2019s theories of\ngeometry and of measurement, including their origins in the work of\nKant, Riemann, and Gauss, and the reception, development, and\nextension of Helmholtz\u2019s work through engagement with Felix\nKlein\u2019s Erlanger Programm, Sophus Lie\u2019s theory of groups,\nthe conventionalism of Henri Poincar\u00e9, and neo-Kantian\nreception in Alois Riehl, Hermann Cohen, Ernst Cassirer, and Bruno\nBauch. Biagioli (2016), Biagioli (2014), and Biagioli (2018) deal with\nthe question of how Helmholtz and neo-Kantians, especially Ernst\nCassirer, could claim that space is transcendental without also\narguing for the universality of Euclidean geometry. Matthias Neuber\n(2012, 163) argues that, while \u201cHelmholtz\u2019s theory of\nspace had significant impact on Schlick\u2019s early \u2018critical\nrealist\u2019 point of view\u201d, Schlick ends up radically\ntransforming Helmholtz\u2019s account.\n\nMarco Giovanelli (2017) argues that the mathematical core of the\ndevelopment of special relativity is found in the Riemannian tradition\nand especially in the work of Christoffel, Lipschitz, Ricci, and,\nlater, Levi-Civit\u00e1 (Giovanelli 2017, 328). Giovanelli argues\nthat the claims for the Helmholtzian tradition as the sole progenitor\nof special relativity are exaggerated, and that the real development\nwas a \u2018collision\u2019 of traditions, in the sense well known\nfrom John Norton\u2019s paper on the Kleinian and Riemannian\ntraditions in general relativity.\n\nBiagioli (2023 and 2016), Darrigol (2003), Paula Cant\u00f9 (2018),\nand Matthias Neuber (Neuber 2018a, Neuber 2018b) delve into\nHelmholtz\u2019s work on the theory of measurement, including his\nessay \u201c\u00dcber Z\u00e4hlen und Messen,\u201d as a precursor\nof more recent treatments of the topic. Cant\u00f9 focuses on the\nquestion of the applicability of mathematics in general, a question\nalso found in Frege, Hale, Wright, and Batitsky, while Neuber and\nBiagioli (2016) focus on Helmholtz\u2019s account of the a priori and\nempirical conditions for measurement in physics and mathematics.\nBiagioli (2023) focuses on Helmholtz\u2019s contributions to the\npsychophysical problem of the measurement of sensation.\n\nFor more detailed explanations of the notions in this section, see the\nentry on\n 19th century geometry.\n\nSee Section 7 of this entry for references to work on the\nphilosophical implications of Helmholtz\u2019s theory of\ngeometry.\n4. Conservation laws, electrodynamics, and acoustics \n4.1 Conservation of energy: 1842\u20131854\n\nFrom 1841 to 1842, Helmholtz finished his studies with Johannes\nM\u00fcller in Berlin. As seen above in the section on physiology,\nM\u00fcller\u2019s endorsement of experimental science was in\npragmatic conflict with his commitment to Naturphilosophie,\nand in particular, to vitalism. According to vitalist theories, in\naddition to the mechanical and physical forces present in a living\nbody, there is a \u201cvital force\u201d that makes the parts of the\nbody work together as an organism. The term for momentum, vis viva,\nillustrates the belief. In the early part of the 19th\ncentury, Ernst Heinrich Weber argued that the so-called \u201cvital\nforces\u201d are in fact physical forces, and he argued that the most\npressing problem for 19th century physiology was to explain\nthe so-called vital forces in physical terms, and thus to banish\nvitalism. According to at least one account, M\u00fcller took his cue\nfrom Weber in setting problems for the students working in his lab,\nincluding Helmholtz, Emil du Bois-Reymond, Rudolf Virchow, and Ernst\nBr\u00fccke, although M\u00fcller knew that Weber\u2019s view was\ninconsistent with his own commitments (K\u00f6nigsberger 1906, 25). It\nis evidence in favor of this view that in 1843, M\u00fcller published\nHelmholtz\u2019s first essay, \u201cOn the Nature of Fermentation\nand Putrefaction,\u201d written in support of Justus von\nLiebig\u2019s anti-vitalist arguments against spontaneous generation,\nin his own journal, M\u00fcller\u2019s Archiv.\n\nAfter receiving his medical degree in 1842, Helmholtz worked as a\nmilitary surgeon in Potsdam from 1843 to 1848. However, he took\nfrequent trips to Berlin to work in Gustav Magnus\u2019s lab, and to\ntalk with M\u00fcller\u2019s other former students and with Carl\nLudwig. As mentioned above, in 1845 Helmholtz joined the Berlin\nPhysical Society, which du Bois-Reymond and Br\u00fccke founded with\nthe express intention of banishing vitalism. Also in 1845, Helmholtz\ntook a five month leave from his work as a surgeon to take his\nqualifying exams. He used the time to work in the lab in Berlin, and\ncontinued to focus on the consequences of Weber\u2019s and\nLiebig\u2019s attacks on vitalism.\n\nLiebig had focused attention on the question of whether an\norganism\u2019s metabolism produces all its heat and mechanical\nenergy. If so, then appealing to a vital force to explain these\nphenomena would be superfluous. Through experiments on frogs\u2019\nmuscles using electrical currents, Helmholtz showed that the heat the\nfrogs\u2019 muscles produced was accounted for by metabolism and\nmuscular action. He published his results in 1845, again in\nM\u00fcller\u2019s journal, in \u201cOn Metabolism during Muscular\nActivity\u201d (see Bevilacqua 1993, 297ff). Helmholtz realized,\nagain in 1845, that the question of whether forces could be accounted\nfor by mechanical means had a much more general application. The\npresupposition of vitalism, that there is an inexhaustible\n\u201cvital force\u201d that powers living bodies, had led some\ninvestigators to posit that there is an inexhaustible force, whether\nmechanical or not, that can power a machine indefinitely: a perpetual\nmotion machine, perpetuum mobile. The realization was\nprompted by Helmholtz\u2019s study of the 18th century classics of\nmathematical analysis: Euler, Bernoulli, D\u2019Alembert, and\nLagrange. As Helmholtz remarked years later, by the end of the 18th\ncentury these mathematicians had established the impossibility of a\nperpetual motion machine powered by mechanical forces:\n\nfor all purely mechanical, that is to say, for moving\nforces,\u2026all our machinery and apparatus generate no force, but\nsimply yield up the power communicated to them by natural forces,\nfalling water, moving wind, or by the muscles of men and animals.\nAfter this law had been established by the great mathematicians of the\nlast century, a perpetual motion, which should make use only of pure\nmechanical forces\u2026could only be sought after by bewildered and\nill-instructed people (Helmholtz 1995 [1854], 24).\n\n\nBut what about the non-mechanical forces: heat, light, electricity and\nmagnetism? When Helmholtz started to look into the question of the\ncharacter of non-mechanical forces, instead of looking for perpetual\nmotion, he asked \u201cif perpetual motion is impossible, what is the\nrelationship between natural forces that must hold?\u201d\n\nOn the 23rd of July in 1847, Helmholtz gave an address, \u201cThe\nConservation of Force,\u201d at the Physical Society.\n\u201cForce\u201d [Kraft], as Helmholtz uses it, is equivalent to\nthe modern term \u201cenergy.\u201d Helmholtz\u2019s address was\nvery well received by the Society, but Helmholtz was forced to publish\nit as a pamphlet after Poggendorff rejected it for his\nAnnalen as too speculative.\n\nHelmholtz summarizes his conclusions in the essay as follows:\n\nThe deduction of the propositions contained in the memoir may be based\non either of two maxims; either on the maxim that it is not possible\nby any combination whatever of natural bodies to derive an unlimited\namount of mechanical force, or on the assumption that all actions in\nnature can be ultimately referred to attractive or repulsive forces,\nthe intensity of which depends solely on the distances between the\npoints at which the forces are exerted. That both these propositions\nare identical is shown at the commencement of the memoir itself\n(Helmholtz 1853 [1847], 114\u2013115; cited in K\u00f6nigsberger\n1906, 39).\n\n\nHelmholtz argues that a proof that all natural actions can be\naccounted for by universal action at a distance is equivalent to a\nrefutation of perpetual motion.\n\nIn 1842\u20131843, Robert Mayer and James Joule had formulated\nprinciples of the conservation of energy. Their work asserted the\nconservation of mv2, the mass of a particle times the\nsquare of its velocity. Further, Joule and Mayer argued that heat and\nmechanical work are interchangeable (see Kuhn 1969, Mach 1911).\nHelmholtz called on Joule\u2019s work (though he claimed to be\nunaware of Meyer\u2019s) to achieve three results. As Bevilaqua\n(1993) sums it up, Helmholtz concluded that:\n\nThe principle of conservation of force implies that the maximum\nquantity of work available from a system is a determined, finite\nquantity if the acting forces do not depend on time and velocity; if\nthey do so depend, or if the forces act in directions other than that\njoining the active material points, the \u201cforce\u201d can be\ngained or lost ad infinitum; and under non-central forces, a system of\nbodies at rest could be set in motion by the effect of its own\ninternal forces (Bevilaqua 1993, 315).\n\n\nKenneth Caneva (2019) argues that Helmholtz\u2019s principle is a\n\u201ccreative refashioning\u201d of the tradition of rational\nmechanics, especially the principles of vis viva and its\nconservation.\u00a0 Bevilacqua argues that the main innovation of\nHelmholtz\u2019s work was to unite two fields, and to anticipate the\nintegration of potential energy into mechanics:\n\nIn the tradition of analytical mechanics, the stress had been on the\nconservation of vis viva; in the tradition of mechanical\nengineering on the conservation of work. Helmholtz, by contrast,\nstressed the equivalence of the two. It was the introduction of the\nterm Spannkraft that brought the real shift in meaning: with\ntension forces we are very far from the concept of work and very close\nto that of potential energy (Bevilaqua 1993, 315).\n\n\nWhile Helmholtz\u2019s work was published in pamphlet form in\nGermany, it was picked up quickly by English scientists and published\nin English translation almost immediately. Helmholtz\u2019s work\nbecame known quickly in English scientific and philosophical circles,\nwhich contributed to his lasting influence in both fields (see Cahan\n2012).\n\nHelmholtz acknowledged in his essay that earlier scientists, including\nJoule, Newton, Bernoulli, and Rumford, had arrived at various forms of\nthe principle of energy conservation. In his history of mechanics,\nErnst Mach argues that some form of Helmholtz\u2019s principle was\nknown to \u201calmost all eminent investigators\u201d in history\n(Mach 1911, 20). In his landmark study of energy conservation, Thomas\nKuhn presents the work of Joule, Mayer, and others from the 1830s,\nwhich argues that heat and work can be substituted for each other\nquantitatively, which is a significant component of Helmholtz\u2019s\nprinciple (Kuhn 1969, 321). Kuhn argues that the discovery of the\nprinciple of energy conservation is a case in which several scientists\nlay the experimental and conceptual framework for a principle\ntogether.\n\nKuhn does insist that Helmholtz formulated the principle. Robert\nPurrington observes, following Kuhn, that \u201cThere was a widely\nheld, intuitive view that the total quantity of force (or motion)\nmight be somehow constant, but it did not necessarily imply an ability\nto distinguish the vector nature of force or momentum from the scalar\nenergy\u201d (Purrington 1997, 105). In his \u201cPhilosophical\nIntroduction\u201d to the essay, Helmholtz himself argues that his\ntask in the essay is not to find new experimental evidence or a\ncompletely new principle, but rather to explain the \u201cunknown\ncauses\u201d of the phenomena from their \u201cvisible\nactions\u201d according to the \u201claws of causality\u201d:\n\nThe problem of the sciences\u2026is, in the first place, to seek the\nlaws by which the particular processes of nature may be referred to,\nand deduced from, general rules. These rules\u2014for example, the\nlaw of the reflection and refraction of light, the law of Mariotte and\nGay-Lussac regarding the volumes of gases\u2014are evidently nothing\nmore than general ideas by which the various phenomena which belong to\nthem are connected together. The finding out of these is the office of\nthe experimental portion of our science. The theoretic portion seeks,\non the contrary, to evolve the unknown causes of the processes from\nthe visible actions which they present; it seeks to comprehend these\nprocesses according to the laws of causality (Helmholtz 1853 [1847],\n114\u2013115; cited in K\u00f6nigsberger 1906, 39).\n\n\nFor the philosophical implications of Helmholtz\u2019s work on the\nconservation of energy, see Bevilacqua (1993) and Hyder (2006 and\n2009). Bevilacqua investigates two matters: Hemholtz\u2019s synthesis\nof earlier work into a single principle, and his methodological\ndistinction, evident in the above citation, between theoretical and\nexperimental physics. Hyder investigates Helmholtz\u2019s argument in\nthe essay that \u201cforce functions must be definable with regard\nonly to the relative positions of the mass-points comprising a\nphysical system\u201d (Hyder 2006, 1). Marshalling the Kantian\nantecedents of the argument, Hyder maintains that Helmholtz\u2019s\nresponse to criticisms of \u201cOn the Conservation of Force\u201d\nby Clausius in 1854 influenced Helmholtz\u2019s later work on\ngeometry. Hyder 2009 is an analysis of Helmholtz\u2019s\n\u201cradical critique\u201d of Kantian geometry in the context of\nHelmholtz\u2019s retention of a \u201ctranscendental element\u201d\nin physics, especially with respect to the relationship between\ngeometry and empirical determinacy (2009, 19). In contrast, Edward\nJurkowitz (2010) argues that \u201calready in his 1847\n\u2018\u00dcber die Erhaltung der Kraft\u2019 one may find important\naspects of [Helmholtz\u2019s] later empiricism\u201d (p. 39).\n4.2 Acoustics, electrodynamics, and fluid dynamics: 1855\u20131881\n\nIn 1857, Helmholtz published \u201cOn the Integrals of the\nHydrodynamic Equations which Express Vortex-Motion\u201d in\nCrelle\u2019s Journal f\u00fcr die reine und angewandte\nMathematik. K\u00f6nigsberger observes that this essay was a\n\u201cwork of genius that proved him to be a mathematician of first\nrank\u201d (K\u00f6nigsberger 1906, 167).\n\nHelmholtz knew of Euler\u2019s and Lagrange\u2019s previous\nmathematical formulas describing fluid motion. Euler\u2019s equation\ntreated fluids as continua or fields, whereas Lagrange\u2019s\nformulation treats them as discrete particles (see Emanuel 2000, 8).\nHelmholtz took up Euler\u2019s equation, which gives the equations of\nthe flow of fluids in which friction does not alter the fluid\u2019s\nmotion significantly (the \u201cinviscid\u201d fluids). Lagrange had\nremarked that Euler\u2019s equations did not work for\n\u201cviscous\u201d fluids, in which the fluid\u2019s friction\nalters its movement, because Euler\u2019s equations work only on the\nassumption of a general conservation law, and viscous forces are not\nconservative (Farge 2004, cf. K\u00f6nigsberger 1906, 167).\n\nHelmholtz, who had formulated a conservation law ten years previously\nin \u201cOn the Conservation of Force,\u201d entered the field at\nthis point. Helmholtz\u2019s own work had concentrated on applying\nthe notion of a potential to fluid movement. But viscous forces do not\nhave potentials. Helmholtz decided to disregard the viscous forces\nthemselves, but also to redefine the problem without appealing to\npotentials. He defined the \u201cvorticity\u201d of a fluid in a\nsmall region as its average rotation or circulation in that region:\nthe rotation at each point on the boundary of the region divided by\nthe area of the region, which is described mathematically as the curl\nof the velocity of the fluid. (In technical terms, Helmholtz evaluated\nthis as the curl of Euler\u2019s equation.) The vorticity of a fluid\nat a single point is a vector quantity. Helmholtz introduced two\nfurther idealizations. A \u201cvortex line\u201d is the tangent to\nthe vorticity vector of a point in the fluid. If you draw vortex lines\non the boundary of a region of the fluid, and then make the region\naround each line indefinitely small, the lines will converge to\n\u201cvortex filaments,\u201d now also called\n\u201cvortices.\u201d\n\nHelmholtz was able to prove three theorems in fluid dynamics using\nthese notions. In their modern expression, they are:\n\n\u201cFluid particles originally free of vorticity [rotation]\nremain free of vorticity.\nFluid particles on a vortex line remain on a vortex line, so that\nvortex lines move with the fluid.\nThe strength of the vorticity is proportional to the length of the\nvortex line\u201d (Fuhs and Shetz 1999, 736).\n\n\nThese laws are used still in fluid dynamics, though they are modified\nslightly from Helmholtz\u2019s original version (they are cited above\nin the contemporary, modified form).\n\nHelmholtz\u2019s work on fluid dynamics is significant\nphilosophically because Helmholtz\u2019s equations requires\nideal fluids, that is, fluids that are free from viscosity\nand perfect continua. Helmholtz\u2019s equations are a paradigm case\nof mathematical idealizations in physics. For a discussion of\nHelmholtz\u2019s work in this context, including his discussions with\nGustav Kirchhoff and the notion, very significant in contemporary\nfluid dynamics, of Helmholtz-Kelvin instability (or Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability), see Eckert 2006, 19ff. For accounts of Helmholtz\u2019s\nuse of idealizations in physics and of the development and\nsignificance of his work in fluid dynamics, see Patton 2009 and\n2012.\n\nIn 1863, a professor of physiology at Bonn, Helmholtz published his\npioneering work on sound waves, acoustics, and musical theory in\nOn the Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory\nof Music. One of the most significant discoveries in On the\nSensations of Tone is the precise mathematical description of\n\u201csound vibrations in an open cylindrical tube\u201d\n(K\u00f6nigsberger 1906, 206). Helmholtz begins On the Sensations\nof Tone with a description of noise as we experience it in\nordinary life:\n\nWe perceive that generally, a noise is accompanied by a rapid\nalternation of different kinds of sensations of sound. Think, for\nexample, of the rattling of a carriage over granite paving stones, the\nsplashing or seething of a waterfall or of the waves of the sea, the\nrustling of leaves in a wood (Helmholtz 1954 [1863], 7).\n\n\nTo analyze the \u201crapid alternations\u201d of these noises into\ntheir component vibrations, Helmholtz constructed the \u201cHelmholtz\nresonator.\u201d Helmholtz began by removing the bottom of an empty,\nuncorked wine bottle, stretching a membrane over the bottom, and\nfastening the membrane with a band. Then he suspended a single thread,\nwith a bit of wax on the end, from the band so that it hung halfway\ndown the membrane. If the thread is agitated, the bit of wax hits the\nmembrane as a drumstick hits a drum. Based on experimental evidence\nand mathematical reasoning, Helmholtz argued that there will be a\nsingle tone, the \u201cprime tone,\u201d that is the tone at which\nthe membrane vibrates at the highest frequency, based on the thickness\nand size of the membrane. By performing experiments, Helmholtz was\nable to distinguish the prime tones of various membranes. Then if he\nplayed music or made noise, the vibration of the membranes would\nreveal the component vibrations of the sound.\n\nThen Helmholtz had the idea of constructing more sophisticated\nresonators, made of spheres or cylinders of glass or metal. The\nresonators narrow to a small, hollow point at one end, and have a\ncircular opening at the other. Helmholtz placed a small piece of hot\nwax at the small end, let it cool, and then inserted it into his ear\nor the ear of a subject. The prime tone of such a resonator is\ndetermined by its own composition and by the sympathetic vibrations of\nthe ear. If a sound other than the prime tone of the resonator plus\near system is played, the listener hears only muffled noises, but\n\u201cif the proper tone of the resonator is sounded, it brays into\nthe ear most powerfully\u201d (Helmholtz 1954 [1863], 43). Again,\nusing resonators allows an experimenter to distinguish the component\nvibrations of music or ordinary noises, by first determining the prime\nor proper tone of the resonator, and then determining, using the\nresonator, whether the music or noise contains that tone.\n\nHeller (2012) considers Helmholtz\u2019s most enduring contributions\nto be his theories of dissonance and musical harmony (p. 441). In the\ntheory of pitch, Heller analyzes a debate between \u201cHelmholtz and\nGeorg Ohm on one side and Rudolf Koenig and August Seebeck on the\nother\u201d, which engaged physicists and instrument makers alike for\ndecades (441ff.). Heller\u2019s work provides an appreciation of the\nstrengths and weaknesses of Helmholtz\u2019s work from the\nperspective of modern physics and acoustical theory. Deutsch 1984\nprovides a complementary perspective on Helmholtz\u2019s place in the\nhistory of the physiology and psychology of music perception.\n\nHui 2011 and especially 2012 are detailed histories of research in\npsychophysics and in acoustics in 19th century Germany, which\nilluminate not only the social and cultural context, but also the\ndebates over scientific advances and experimental results.\n\nIt is typical of Helmholtz that, even as he was working on acoustics,\nhe realized that his work on sound waves could apply to related wave\nphenomena, if supplemented with mathematical reasoning and\nexperimentation. Recent work on electrodynamics supported the\nconclusion that electricity was a wave phenomenon. In 1845, Faraday\nhad demonstrated the connection between electric and magnetic\nphenomena. In 1856, Wilhelm Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch discovered the\nratio between electromagnetic and electrostatic units of charge (Assis\n1994, 18). If he could describe sound vibrations in a cylindrical\ntube, Helmholtz reasoned, similar equations might be successful for\ndescribing the motion of electrical waves around a circular\nboundary.\n\nIn 1861, Helmholtz gave a lecture, \u201cA Universal Method of the\nTransformation of Problems of Electrical Distribution,\u201d to the\nSociety for Natural History and Medicine at Heidelberg. Helmholtz was\nunaware that, in letters to Liouville, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)\nhad achieved the same results that he had, but he was told of this\nimmediately afterward. Helmholtz, who had met Kelvin in 1855 and had\nbeen corresponding with him since 1856, acknowledged Kelvin\u2019s\npriority in the Transactions of the Heidelberg society in 1862, and\nwrote to Kelvin to ask whether he would be willing to publish his\nresults about the \u201cdistribution of electricity at a circular\nedge\u201d (K\u00f6nigsberger 1906, 206). Kelvin responded with his\nown results. Between 1861 and 1864, James Clerk Maxwell postulated\nthat light was an electromagnetic wave in the ether (Assis 1994, 18).\nIn 1864, Helmholtz traveled to England. During the trip, Helmholtz met\nwith Kelvin, John Tyndall, George Stokes, James Joule, Michael\nFaraday, Thomas Huxley, Thomas Graham, Max M\u00fcller, and Maxwell.\nHe visited Graham\u2019s, Maxwell\u2019s, and Kelvin\u2019s\nlaboratories. By the end of the 1860s, Helmholtz was well informed on\nthe experimental and theoretical basis of the new electrodynamic\ntheory in England.\n\nAlisa Bokulich (2015) explores the analogies that Maxwell and\nHelmholtz draw between hydrodynamics and electrodynamics, arguing that\ntheir methods give \u201cinsight into debates about the\nrepresentational and explanatory power of mathematical models\u201d\n(p. 28). Susan Sterrett (2017) \u201cprovides a critical history of\nthe concept of physically similar systems\u201d, including the use of\nthe concept in Helmholtz\u2019s theoretical hydrodynamics.\n\nIn 1870, Helmholtz published the first Part of \u201cOn the Theory of\nElectrodynamics,\u201d \u201cEquations of Motion of Electricity in\nConductors at Rest,\u201d in Crelle\u2019s Journal f\u00fcr die\nreine und angewandte Mathematik. In the essay, Helmholtz\nsupported Maxwell\u2019s work, but criticized Wilhelm Weber\u2019s\nelectrodynamic equations, charging that Weber\u2019s equations posit\nan infinite kinetic energy, which contradicts Helmholtz\u2019s\nconservation law of 1847. Weber and Helmholtz disputed the question\nthroughout the 1870s. Over the next several years, Helmholtz published\ntwo more Parts of \u201cOn the Theory of Electrodynamics,\u201d in\nwhich he responded to Weber and continued to support Maxwell\u2019s\nassertion that light is an electromagnetic wave in the ether. The\ndebate between Helmholtz and Weber did not reach a conclusion until\nthe end of the 1880s, when the explanation of electromagnetic force in\nterms of action at a distance between particles in the ether gave way\nto the field theory.\n5. Thermodynamics, the least action principle, and free energies: 1881\u20131887\n\nIn 1880, Helmholtz became the director of the Institute of Physics in\nBerlin. Between 1881 and 1884, Helmholtz attacked the question of how\nto integrate energy conservation and Maupertuis\u2019s principle of\nleast action to describe thermodynamic and chemical processes.\n\nOver the 19th century, the application of the least action principle\ndominated the approach of analytical dynamics to physical problems.\nLagrangian mechanics seeks to determine the trajectory of a system of\nparticles over time by solving Lagrangian equations for the system.\nThese equations are formulated using the least action principle. In\nthe Lagrangian formalism, a system of particles follows a path that\nminimizes the action over time. Lagrange\u2019s equations can be\napplied easily to systems of polar coordinates and of Cartesian\ncoordinates alike, a reason that the Lagrangian formalism was adopted\npreferentially over the 19th century.\n\nWhile the Lagrangian formalism is well adapted to evaluating\nmechanical systems of particles, it is not as well suited to\nevaluating some transfers of energy, which involve calculations over a\nvast multitude of molecules. The Hamiltonian formalism is better\nsuited to this task. The Hamiltonian equations also evaluate the\naction in a system, but use an integral sum of the momenta of the\nelements of the system. In the simplest case, the Lagrangian deals\nwith the velocity of a particle and the Hamiltonian with the momenta\nof the particle. The Hamiltonian gives a minimum value for a function\nover any path given the initial and end states of the action. Thus,\nthe Hamiltonian formalism yields the same result, namely the\nmathematical determination of the path taken by a system.\n\nThe Hamiltonian expression of the momenta of the system can be derived\nfrom the Lagrangian, and vice versa, using a Legendre transform. In\nfact, the Hamiltonian just is the Legendre transform of the\nLagrangian for any given system. The formalisms are equivalent, but\nthere are some situations, including evaluating heat transfer, in\nwhich the Hamiltonian is preferred.\n\nIn 1882, Helmholtz gave an address, \u201cThe Thermodynamics of\nChemical Processes,\u201d at the Berlin Academy. Up until\nHelmholtz\u2019s address, chemical reactions had been explained by\n\u201cchemical forces\u201d or \u201caffinities\u201d between\nchemical substances, measured quantitatively by the heat developed\nduring a chemical reaction. Gustave Coriolis had clarified the notion\nof work as the product of force over distance in 1821, and this notion\nwas in common use by the late 19th century. In his address, Helmholtz\n\u201cproved that affinity was not given by the heat evolved in a\nchemical reaction but rather by the maximum work produced when the\nreaction was carried out reversibly\u201d (Kragh 1993, 405). However,\nwhile kinetic and mechanical energy can be converted into heat in\nevery case, only in restricted cases can heat be converted into\nkinetic and mechanical energy. Hence, the equations describing\nchemical processes involving heat could not always be reversed. These\nare the conditions under which the Legendre transform could not be\napplied, and thus the Hamiltonian could not be determined for that\nsystem.\n\nIn particular, the equations for a system containing heat as a\nvariable contain entropy as a variable quantity. Entropy is an\ninconvenient variable, difficult to control for and hold constant as\none can hold temperature, pressure, and volume constant. The Legendre\ntransform allows a researcher to convert equations containing entropy\ninto equations expressed only in terms of temperature, pressure, and\nvolume. The Legendre transform can be applied correctly only under\ncertain conditions, which must be specified.\n\nHelmholtz proposed the notion of a \u201cfree energy\u201d to\naccount for cases involving heat and entropy. The Helmholtz free\nenergy is defined as F \u21d4 E \u2212 TS,\nwhere E is energy, T is temperature, and S\nis entropy. The free energy equation yields a quantity, F,\nthat is independent of heat and entropy. Many equations involving\nF and not T or S are fully reversible, and\nso Helmholtz\u2019s work allowed for the application of the\nHamiltonian to many chemical processes. Hence while \u201cHelmholtz\nwas neither the sole nor the most important contributor\u201d to\ntheoretical chemistry, \u201chis thermodynamic theory of\n1882\u20131883 was the pioneering work on which much of the new\ntheoretical chemistry rested\u201d (Kragh 1993, 406).\n\nFor discussions of the philosophical and scientific implications of\nHelmholtz\u2019s work in thermodynamics, see Kragh 1993 and Campisi\n2005.\n6. The Berlin School of Physics: 1878\u20131894\n\nBy the end of the 1870s, the experimental basis of electrodynamics had\nbeen established, but mathematics lagged behind. In memoirs of his\ntraining, Arnold Sommerfeld recalls that until the 1880s, the laws of\nelectromagnetic phenomena were constructed using unwieldy extensions\nof Coulomb\u2019s, Biot-Savart\u2019s, and Weber\u2019s\ngeneralizations of Newton\u2019s laws (Sommerfeld 1952, 1\u20132).\nFurther, although the relationship between electric and magnetic\nphenomena had been established, there was no direct empirical evidence\nfor the existence of electromagnetic waves.\n\nBetween 1870 and 1887, Helmholtz was Director of the Institute of\nPhysics at Berlin University. Between 1880 and 1933, the following\nscientists worked in Berlin: \u201cMax Planck [Helmholtz\u2019s\nstudent] and Albert Einstein above all, also Gustav Robert Kirchhoff,\nFriedrich Kohlrausch, Emil Warburg, Walther Nernst, Max von Laue,\nJames Franck, Gustav Hertz, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Peter Debye\u201d\nand others (Hoffmann 1998, 1).\n\nPerhaps the most significant relationship Helmholtz had with a student\nor colleague was with Heinrich Hertz. Beginning in 1878, Hertz did\nresearch as a graduate student in Helmholtz\u2019s and\nKirchhoff\u2019s laboratories. In 1879, Helmholtz set a prize problem\nfor the Prussian Academy of Science: \u201cTo establish\nexperimentally any relation between electromagnetic forces and the\ndielectric polarization of insulators\u201d (von Harnack 1900, 617,\ncited Hoffmann 1998, 6). While Hertz was very interested in the\nproblem, he put it aside in 1879 to pursue other work. In 1880, Hertz\ngraduated and took a position as Helmholtz\u2019s assistant. From\n1886 on in his own laboratory in Karlsruhe, Hertz performed his\nnow-famous experiments, which Hertz himself acknowledged were prompted\nby Helmholtz\u2019s prize question, demonstrating the existence of\nradio waves (which are a kind of electromagnetic wave). Hertz\n\u201cdiscussed his progress and results immediately and in great\ndetail with Helmholtz\u201d (Hoffmann 1998, 6).\n\nHertz\u2019s experiments and their consequences finally laid to rest\nthe disputes between Helmholtz and Wilhelm Weber. Among those\nconsequences was the death of Helmholtz\u2019s view that\nelectromagnetism is a kind of action at a distance, and the\nreplacement of the action at a distance view with a field theory,\n\u201cone of the major turning points in the history of\nphysics\u201d (Heidelberger 1998, 9). Since Hertz revealed empirical\nevidence for the existence of electromagnetic waves, \u201cthe\nsources of the electrodynamic effect are not anymore to be sought in\nagents that are hidden from our view but in the surrounding\nmedium\u201d (Heidelberger 1998, 17). While Helmholtz supported\nMaxwell\u2019s view that electromagnetism was a wave in the ether,\nHelmholtz explained wave propagation by means of action at a distance.\nHertz demonstrated that electromagnetic waves were perturbations in a\nmedium, which at the time was thought to be the ether, and which later\nwas re-conceived as a field. More importantly, Hertz explained the\npropagation of electromagnetic waves directly \u201cfrom the\ninteractions themselves,\u201d based on his empirical data, and thus\ndid not need to appeal to actions at a distance (Buchwald 1994,\n265ff).\n\nAlthough Hertz\u2019s results were in conflict with his own theory,\nHelmholtz supported Hertz\u2019s career with unflagging enthusiasm\nuntil Hertz\u2019s death at the age of 37. Recent scholarship by Jed\nBuchwald emphasizes the influence of Helmholtz\u2019s methods and\ntheory on Hertz\u2019s discoveries (Buchwald 1994).\n\nIn 1888 Helmholtz assumed the founding directorship of the\nPhysikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt, an institute for the study of\nphysics and industrial technology in Berlin founded in part by\nHelmholtz\u2019s lifelong associate Werner von Siemens. For a\ncomprehensive history of the institute that illuminates the history of\nHelmholtz\u2019s later career, see Cahan 1989. Helmholtz retained the\npost until the end of his life.\n\nFor philosophical treatments of the shift from action at a distance to\nfield theory, and from Helmholtz to Hertz, see Heidelberger 1998 and\nLeroux 2001. See also Purrington 1997.\n7. Epistemology\n\nIn 1921, 100 years after Helmholtz was born, Paul Hertz and Moritz\nSchlick brought out an edition of Helmholtz\u2019s epistemological\nwritings: Schriften zur Erkenntnistheorie. This edition made\navailable \u201cOn the Origin and Significance of the Axioms of\nGeometry,\u201d \u201cOn the Facts Underlying Geometry,\u201d\n\u201cNumbering and Measuring from an Epistemological\nViewpoint,\u201d and \u201cThe Facts in Perception.\u201d\nSchlick\u2019s part in the selection of work having to do with\ngeometry and empirical measurement is significant. Schlick, a close\nassociate of Einstein\u2019s, saw the relevance Helmholtz\u2019s\nwork had for Einstein\u2019s theory. For a discussion of the\ninfluence of Helmholtz on the early career of Einstein, see Cahan\n2000, 70ff.\n\nSchlick and Paul Hertz assess the relevance of Helmholtz\u2019s work\nas follows: Helmholtz\u2019s \u201cclassic works on physics \u2014\none may for example recall the energy principle or his work on vortex\nmotions \u2014 stand at the end of lines of\ndevelopment\u2026 his work seems for science at its present stage to\nbe something completed and left behind. There is only one field, but a\nvery important one, to which this does not apply: it does not hold for\nHelmholtz\u2019s epistemological studies\u201d (Hertz and Schlick\n1977 [1921], xxxiv). In his Notes on \u201cOn the Origin and\nSignificance of the Axioms of Geometry,\u201d Schlick sees the\n\u201cchief epistemological result\u201d of Helmholtz\u2019s work\nin the replacement of the Kantian necessary a priori with a judgment\nthat \u201cEuclidean space is not an inescapable form of our\nfaculty of intuition, but a product of experience\u201d\n(Schlick\u2019s note to Helmholtz 1921 [1868], 35).\n\nFor a thorough discussion of the anti-Kantian implications of\n\u201cOn the Origin and Significance of the Axioms of\nGeometry,\u201d see DiSalle 1993, 516ff. DiSalle discusses\nHelmholtz\u2019s famous debate with the Kantian J. P. N. Land, as\ndoes David Hyder (Hyder 2006, Land 1877). DiSalle also mentions that\nin 1972, J\u00fcrgen Ehlers, Felix Pirani, and Alfred Schild\n\u201cderived the metric of general-relativistic spacetime from\nassumptions about falling bodies and light rays\u201d (DiSalle 1993,\n520n). Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild note that their method \u201chas\nsome similarity to Helmholtz\u2019s derivation of the metrics of\nspaces of constant curvature\u201d (Ehlers et al. 1972, 65).\n\nDespite Schlick\u2019s conviction that Helmholtz\u2019s view is\nantithetical to Kantianism, Helmholtz\u2019s notion that the a priori\nin space consists of the manifold of possible orientations in space\nhas inspired new readings of Kant\u2019s a priori. This influence\ncomes partly through the mediation of Hans Reichenbach, whose reading\nof Helmholtz was significantly different from Schlick\u2019s\n(Reichenbach 1920). Reichenbach and Schlick both pointed out the\nrelationship between the views of Helmholtz and those of\nPoincar\u00e9, though Schlick realizes that Helmholtz is not a\nconventionalist and Reichenbach may not have done (see Schlick\u2019s\nnote 40 to Helmholtz 1921 [1868], 34). For a discussion of\nHelmholtz\u2019s influence on Michael Friedman\u2019s reading of\nKant, also influenced by Robert DiSalle, see Friedman 2000. Also see\nFriedman 2001, Chapter One.\n\nIn The Mechanics of Meaning, David Hyder traces discussions\nof Helmholtz\u2019s theory regarding \u201csensation-spaces and\ntheir relation to the philosophy of space and perception\u201d by\nBoltzmann, Poincar\u00e9, Carnap, Russell, and Weyl (Hyder 2002,\n19n). De Kock 2013 is an analysis of the problem of externality in\nHelmholtz\u2019s theory of perception. Biagioli (2014) analyzes\nHelmholtz\u2019s debate with Albrecht Krause over the status of\ngeometrical axioms; more generally, Biagioli\u2019s work illuminates\nHelmholtz\u2019s relationship to Poincar\u00e9 and to Holder.\nDarrigol 2003 also places Helmholtz\u2019s work in context, including\nwith respect to related work by Grassmann, Fechner, and Wundt.\nDarrigol\u2019s focus is Helmholtz\u2019s theory of number and\nmeasure in physics and mathematics.\n\nIn Hermann von Helmholtz\u2019s Mechanism, Gregor Schiemann\nsees Helmholtz\u2019s work in the sciences as characteristic of a\nshift from the early modern to the modern tradition, as emblematic of\nthe \u201crelativization of claims to validity\u201d of scientific\nknowledge, the \u201closs of certainty\u201d characteristic of the\nmodern attitude toward science.\n\nThe influence of Hertz, and indirectly Helmholtz, on Wittgenstein is\nargued by many. Brian McGuinness, Wittgenstein\u2019s biographer, and\nPeter Hacker, in Insight and Illusion, are perhaps the first\nto have so argued (see, e.g., Grasshoff 1993, 243, Hacker 1986,\n2\u20134). Gerd Grasshoff traces the development in Grasshoff 1993,\narguing that Hertz and Boltzmann were the first to develop a\n\u201cpicture theory,\u201d according to which physical and\nlinguistic theories give us pictures [Bilder in the original\nGerman] of the world. Hertz\u2019s and Boltzmann\u2019s picture\n(Bild) theories go well beyond Helmholtz\u2019s view.\nHelmholtz argues that the constraints on using Bilder to\nconstruct scientific explanations are given by physical experience and\nnatural science, and Hertz and Boltzmann argue that these constraints\nare determined mathematically. However, according to this\ninterpretation, the historical roots of the picture theory can be\nfound in Helmholtz\u2019s substitution of the \u201csign\ntheory\u201d for nativistic explanations (see, e.g., Schiemann 1998,\nPatton 2009). According to Helmholtz\u2019s \u201csign\u201d\ntheory, our physical perceptions are images or symbols that do not\nresemble their objects directly. Michael Heidelberger and Jean Leroux\nargue as well for the influence of Helmholtz\u2019s sign theory on\nHertz\u2019s picture theory in Heidelberger 1998 and Leroux 2001. See\nsection 2 for a detailed discussion of the sign theory.\n\nIn his early writings, Helmholtz defends a broadly Kantian methodology\nagainst a more far-reaching idealism. In \u201cOn the Relation of\nNatural Science to Science in General\u201d, Helmholtz opposes Kant\nto Hegel. Helmholtz argues that for Kant \u201ca principle discovered\na priori was a rule applicable to the method of pure thought, and\nnothing further; it could contain no real, positive knowledge\u201d\n(Helmholtz 1995 [1862], 79). For Hegel, on the other hand, \u201cnot\nonly the physical phenomena, but even the actual world\u2026were the\nresult of an act of thought on the part of the creative mind\u201d\n(ibid.). As a result, according to Helmholtz, Hegel attempted\nto unify the human and the natural sciences (the Geistes- and the\nNaturwissenschaften).\n\nThe question of the independence of the methods of the human sciences,\nprominently including history, from the physical sciences became the\ntheme of heated debate over the 19th century. Wilhelm Dilthey (1883\n[1989]) defended the independence of the methods of the human\nsciences, while Wilhelm Windelband (1980/1894) argued that only the\nnatural, physical sciences are \u201cnomothetic,\u201d or\nlaw-governed, and thus genuinely scientific (see Beiser 2012 and\nPatton 2019 for more detail on this debate and its history).\n\nIn an essay on the relation of the natural sciences to science in\ngeneral, Helmholtz observes that it is true that the human sciences\nbecame increasingly scientific over the first half of the 19th\ncentury. As a result, \u201cthe opposition between them and the\nphysical sciences has become less and less marked\u201d (Helmholtz\n1995 [1862], 81). Helmholtz argues that nonetheless there is a\nprofound difference, and that,\n\nIn short, there is no denying that, while the moral sciences deal\ndirectly with the nearest and dearest interests of the human mind, and\nwith the institutions it has brought into being, the natural sciences\nare concerned with dead, indifferent matter, obviously indispensable\nfor the sake of its practical utility, but apparently without any\nimmediate bearing on the cultivation of the intellect (Helmholtz 1995\n[1862], 81).\n\n\nHelmholtz then addresses the old question of the \u201cdispute of the\nfaculties\u201d \u2014 is it better to separate the study of the\nnatural sciences from all others? He concludes that the logical\ninduction characteristic of natural sciences must always be\nsupplemented with the aesthetic induction of the human\nsciences, which draws conclusions about human character and behavior\n(Helmholtz 1995 [1862], 85). Helmholtz concludes that the best outcome\nfor human knowledge is to encourage the strengths of aesthetic and\nlogical induction, to maintain the presence of both in the same\nacademy, while keeping their foundations and methods strictly\nseparate. The Hegelian program of methodological and conceptual\nunification must give way to a separation between the\nGeisteswissenschaften and the\nNaturwissenschaften.\n\nHelmholtz observes that what he sees as the attempt by the Hegelian\nphilosophy to legislate for natural science resulted in the following\nimpasse:\n\nThat in the moral sciences traces of the activity of the human\nintellect and of the several stages of its development should present\nthemselves, was a matter of course; but surely, if nature really\nreflected the result of the thought of a creative mind, the system\nought, without difficulty, to find a place for her comparatively\nsimple phenomena and processes. It was at this point that\nHegel\u2019s philosophy, we venture to say, utterly broke down. His\nsystem of nature seemed, at least to natural philosophers, absolutely\ncrazy\u2026. The philosophers accused the scientific men of\nnarrowness; the scientific men retorted that the philosophers were\ncrazy. And so it came about that men of science began to lay some\nstress on the banishment of all philosophical influences from their\nwork\u2026 Thus, it must be confessed, not only were the\nillegitimate pretensions of the Hegelian system to subordinate to\nitself all other studies rejected, but no regard was paid to the\nrightful claims of philosophy, that is, the criticism of the sources\nof cognition, and the definition of the functions of the intellect.\n(Helmholtz 1995 [1862], 79\u201380)\n\n\nHelmholtz concludes that once natural scientists, physiologists of\nperception such as himself, entered the philosophical fray, \u201cthe\npath of future investigation was basically prescribed by the inductive\nmethods of the natural sciences\u201d (ibid. 394).\nHelmholtz\u2019s work in epistemology epitomizes the return to the\nmethods of the natural sciences in the mid-19th century. See Patton\n(2019) and Schiemann (2013) for more on the background of changes to\nthe approach to the sciences over the 19th century.\n",
