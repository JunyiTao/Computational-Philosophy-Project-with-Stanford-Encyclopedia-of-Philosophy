Accordingly, attending to moral reasoning\nwill often be useful to those whose real interest is in determining\nthe right answer to some concrete moral problem or in arguing for or\nagainst some moral theory. The characteristic ways we attempt to work\nthrough a given sort of moral quandary can be just as revealing about\nour considered approaches to these matters as are any bottom-line\njudgments we may characteristically come to. Further, we may have\nfirm, reflective convictions about how a given class of problems is\nbest tackled, deliberatively, even when we remain in doubt about what\nshould be done. In such cases, attending to the modes of moral\nreasoning that we characteristically accept can usefully expand the\nset of moral information from which we start, suggesting ways to\nstructure the competing considerations. \n\nFacts about the nature of moral inference and moral reasoning may have\nimportant direct implications for moral theory. For instance, it might\nbe taken to be a condition of adequacy of any moral theory that it\nplay a practically useful role in our efforts at self-understanding\nand deliberation. It should be deliberation-guiding (Richardson 2018,\n\u00a71.2). If this condition is accepted, then any moral theory that\nwould require agents to engage in abstruse or difficult reasoning may\nbe inadequate for that reason, as would be any theory that assumes\nthat ordinary individuals are generally unable to reason in the ways\nthat the theory calls for. J.S. Mill (1979) conceded that we are\ngenerally unable to do the calculations called for by utilitarianism,\nas he understood it, and argued that we should be consoled by the fact\nthat, over the course of history, experience has generated secondary\nprinciples that guide us well enough. Rather more dramatically, R. M.\nHare defended utilitarianism as well capturing the reasoning of\nideally informed and rational \u201carchangels\u201d (1981). Taking seriously a\ndeliberation-guidance desideratum for moral theory would favor,\ninstead, theories that more directly inform efforts at moral reasoning\nby we \u201cproletarians,\u201d to use Hare\u2019s contrasting term. \n\nAccordingly, the close relations between moral reasoning, the moral\nfacts, and moral theory do not eliminate moral reasoning as a topic of\ninterest. To the contrary, because moral reasoning has important\nimplications about moral facts and moral theories, these close\nrelations lend additional interest to the topic of moral reasoning.\n\n",
