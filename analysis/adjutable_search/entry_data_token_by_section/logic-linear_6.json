Complexity\n\nFor any given logic, it is useful to know whether or not there is an\neffective procedure to determine, for each sentence in the logic, if\nit is provable or not. A decidable logic\u2014i.e., one for\nwhich there is an effective procedure for provability\u2014is often\ndescribed by its complexity class, which characterizes how\ndifficult it is to perform the decision procedure. Extensive research\nwork has been dedicated to the study of the complexity and\ndecidability issues for several fragments of propositional linear\nlogic. It is known that\n\nMLL provability is NP-complete\n (Kanovich 1992) and \nMALL provability is PSPACE-complete\n (Lincoln et al. 1992).\n\nHere, \nNP and PSPACE are complexity classes such that NP\n\\(\\subseteq\\) PSPACE.  Surprisingly, for those\nthat may forget that the novelty in linear logic lies in the way\nformulas are managed without the structural rules of contraction and\nweakening, these results stay the same even if we focus on the\nfragments of the logics where only the constants, and no propositional\nvariables, are allowed\n (Lincoln & Winkler 1994). Indeed, it is possible to encode arbitrary formulas\ninto constant-only formulas preserving provability.\n\nMELL is a surprisingly expressive logic. For example, the reachability\nproblem in Petri nets can be encoded into MELL\n (Gunter & Gehlot 1989)\n and that problem is equivalent to the reachability problem of vector\naddition systems with states (VASS)\n (Reutenauer 1989).\n Furthermore, the decidability problem of MELL is equivalent to the\nreachability problem for branching VASS\n (de Groote et al. 2004)\n and the latter is known to have a non-elementary lower bound\n (Lazic and Schmitz 2015).\n Thus, if MELL turns out to be decidable, it will be at least TOWER-hard\n (Lazic and Schmitz 2015).\n A proof of the decidability of MELL has been given by Bimb\u00f3\n (2015)\n but a gap in that proof has been reported by Stra\u00dfburger\n (2019).\n \n\nProofs of the undecidability of propositional linear logic were\npublished in the early 1990s (Lincoln et\nal. 1992, Lincoln 1995).\nKanovich (2016) showed that this\nundecidability result holds for a greatly reduced fragment of\npropositional linear logic.  and a machine checked proof of undecidability\nhas been published in (Forster\n& Larchey-Wendling, 2019).  However, a proof\nof decidability of propositional linear logic has also been published\nby Bimb\u00f3 & Dunn in (2022), who also\nclaim to have found mistakes in the above-mentioned papers.\n\n\nLinear logic with the unrestricted weakening rule added (also known as\nlinear affine logic) is decidable\n (Kopylov 1995)\n and exponential space hard\n (Urquhart 2000).\n \n\nA good overview of complexity results surrounding linear logic can be\nfound in\n Lincoln 1995.\n",
