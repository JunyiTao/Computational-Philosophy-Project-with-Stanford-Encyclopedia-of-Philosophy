    "main_text": "\n\n\nConfucianism, Daoism (Taoism), and Buddhism generally name the three\nmain currents of Chinese thought, although it should be obvious that\nlike any \u201cism,\u201d they are abstractions\u2014what they name\nare not monolithic but multifaceted traditions with fuzzy\nboundaries. In the case of \u201cDaoism,\u201d it designates both a\nphilosophical tradition and an organized religion, which in modern\nChinese are identified separately as daojia\nand daojiao, respectively. With their own rich histories and\ninternal differences, the two are deeply intertwined. Laozi (or\nLao-tzu, in the \u201cWade-Giles\u201d system of transliteration\nfavored by earlier generations of Western scholars) figures centrally\nin both.\n\n\nPhilosophical Daoism traces its origins to Laozi, an extraordinary\nthinker who flourished during the sixth century B.C.E., according to\nChinese sources. According to some modern scholars, however, Laozi is\nentirely legendary; there was never a historical Laozi. In religious\nDaoism, Laozi is revered as a supreme deity.\n\n\nThe name \u201cLaozi\u201d is best taken to mean \u201cOld\n(lao) Master (zi),\u201d and Laozi the ancient\nphilosopher is said to have written a short book, which has come to be\ncalled simply the Laozi, after its putative author, a common\npractice in early China.\n\n\nWhen the Laozi was recognized as a \u201cclassic\u201d\n(jing)\u2014that is, accorded canonical status in the\nclassification of Chinese literature, on account of its profound\ninsight and significance\u2014it acquired a more exalted and\nhermeneutically instructive title, Daodejing (Tao-te\nching), commonly translated as the \u201cClassic of the Way and\nVirtue.\u201d Its influence on Chinese culture is pervasive, and it\nreaches beyond China. It is concerned with the Dao or\n\u201cWay\u201d and how it finds expression in \u201cvirtue\u201d\n(de), especially through what the text calls\n\u201cnaturalness\u201d (ziran) and \u201cnonaction\u201d\n(wuwei). These concepts, however, are open to\ninterpretation. While some interpreters see them as evidence that\nthe Laozi is a deeply spiritual work, others emphasize their\ncontribution to ethics and/or political philosophy. Interpreting\nthe Laozi demands careful hermeneutic reconstruction, which\nrequires both analytic rigor and an informed historical\nimagination.\n",
