    "main_text": "Epistemology || Mind and Ideas\n2.1 Mind and Ideas\n\nAstell holds that the mind has two faculties: the understanding and\nthe will. The understanding is the capacity to receive and compare\nideas, and the will is the power of preferring and directing thoughts\nand motions (Astell SP, 205). Each faculty has a proper object: the\nproper object of the understanding is truth, which has \u201cbeing\nfrom Eternity in the Divine Ideas\u201d (137); the proper object of\nthe will is the good, which is God\u2019s will (206). When the\nunderstanding is healthy, it has knowledge (130); when the will is\nhealthy, it is regular\u2014that is, it is guided by the\nunderstanding (205, 209). The task of the understanding is to govern\nthe will by obtaining truth (130). \n\nAstell holds a view according to which there are not merely innate\nideas, but also innate inclinations. She explains that the innate\nideas are \u201crudiments of knowledge\u201d (128) that are\n\u201cinseparable\u201d from the understanding and are the sources\nof our other ideas (Astell SP, 205). In addition, she states that we\nare born with inclinations that are \u201cinseparable\u201d from the\nwill (205). She explains that our innate ideas make us rational\ncreatures. Irrational creatures, on the other hand, act according to\nthe will of God and by mechanism. But equipped with reason, humans are\nvoluntary agents: we choose our actions according to principles in the\nunderstanding, and we determine our wills (128).\n\nAstell provides two accounts of ideas, one general and one strict. In\ndoing so, she presents her views on knowledge and clear and distinct\nperceptions. Here is the general account of ideas, which is broad\nenough to encompass all thinking:\n\nBy Ideas we sometimes understand in general all that which is the\nimmediate Object of the Mind, whatever it Perceives; and in this large\nSense it may take in all Thought, all that we are any ways capable of\nDiscerning: So when we have no Idea of a thing, \u2019tis as much as\nto say we know nothing of the matter. (168)\n\nIn the general sense, ideas\u2014the immediate objects of the\nmind\u2014are required for knowledge insofar as we need to have some\nidea of a thing in order to have knowledge of it in the sense that we\nare familiar with it. But Astell also gives a stricter, more\nrestricted account of the term 'idea' when she is talking about the\nmore philosophical notion of knowledge as that which is clear and\ndistinct:\n\nAgain, it [the word \u2018idea\u2019] is more strictly taken for\nthat which represents to the Mind some object distinct from it,\nwhether Clearly or Confusedly; when this is its import, our Knowledge\nis said to be as Clear as our Ideas are. For that Idea which\nrepresents a thing so Clearly, that by an Attent and Simple View we\nmay discern its Properties and Modifications, at least so far as they\ncan be Known, is never false; for our Certainty and Evidence depends\non it, if we Know not Truly what is thus represented to our Minds we\nknow nothing. (Astell SP, 168)\n\n\nIdeas in the strict sense represent what is distinct from the mind. As\nsuch, ideas must be clear in order for them to afford knowledge. \n\nFor Astell, though ideas can be confused, they are not themselves the\nsources of error. Rather, Astell locates falsity and error in both\njudgments and in language (169, 171). About judgment: she holds that\njudgment involves the comparison of two ideas; error arises when we\nlack an \u201cintermediate idea\u201d (a \u201cmiddle term\u201d)\nin order to make a judgment (146\u20137, 172\u20133) (see section\n2.2 for a discussion of middle terms). It will help us to avoid this\nkind of error in judgment if we properly use our words that are\nassociated with ideas (172). To do this kind of work, we need to first\nexamine ideas about morality and religion, separating the ideas we\napprehend through philosophical reflection from those we have adopted\nby custom, the latter of which are so often not true ideas. For\nexample, Astell stresses that women need to release the false ideas\nthey have about their natures (ideas they gained from their society)\nand come to understand that they have immortal natures based in the\n\u201cparticle of Divinity\u201d that they have within their selves\n(53). Ultimately all reasonings and deductions should begin from ideas\nthat are clear and are \u201cas distinct as the nature of the subject\nwill permit\u201d (169\u201372). (This issue has implications for\nAstell\u2019s ethics, as explained in section 4 below.)\n",
