    "main_text": "Machian Positivism || \u201cMach\u2019s Principle\u201d\n2.4 \u201cMach\u2019s Principle\u201d\n\nFor a number of years Einstein expressed the ambition of the general\ntheory of relativity to fully implement Mach\u2019s program for the\nrelativization of all inertial effects, even appending the so-called\ncosmological constant in an attempt to obtain a fully Machian\nglobal solution to his field equations (1917b) for this purpose. This\ngenuine point of contact of Mach\u2019s influence was clearly\nidentified only in 1918, when Einstein distinguished what he baptized\nas Mach\u2019s Principle \u2014(too) strongly stated as the\nrequirement that the metric field (responsible for\ngravitational-inertial properties of bodies) on the left hand side of\nhis field equation, is completely determined by the\nenergy-momentum tensor on the right hand side\u2014from the principle\nof general relativity which he misleadingly interpreted as the\nprinciple of general covariance. Taken together with the principle of\nthe equivalence, Einstein asserted that the three principles, were\nthree pillars on which his theory rested, even if they could not be\nthought completely independent of one another. Despite\nEinstein\u2019s intent, there is considerable disagreement about the\nextent to which, if at all, the general theory of relativity could\nconform to anything like Mach\u2019s Principle. The Dutch astronomer\nWillem De Sitter had immediately shown in 1917 that the Einstein field\nequations, even as augmented with the new cosmological constant,\npermitted matter-free solutions. Machians still have some room for\nmaneuver due to vagaries regarding just what such a principle actually\nrequires. On the other hand, it remains difficult to comprehend just\nwhat physical process or mechanism might implement the principle,\nhowever interpreted. How, for instance, might a given body\u2019s\ninertial mass be accounted due to the influence of all other masses in\nthe universe? (See the discussions in Barbour & Pfister 1995.)\n",
