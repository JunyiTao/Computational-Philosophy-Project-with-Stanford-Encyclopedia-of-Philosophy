    "main_text": "Deduction Calculi || Term Rewriting\n2.5 Term Rewriting\n\nEquality is an important logical relation whose behavior within\nautomated deduction deserves its own separate treatment.\nEquational logic and, more generally, term\nrewriting treat equality-like equations as rewrite\nrules, also known as reduction or\ndemodulation rules. An equality statement like\nf(a)= a allows the simplification of a term\nlike g(c,f(a)) to\ng(c,a). However, the same equation also has\nthe potential to generate an unboundedly large term:\ng(c,f(a)),\ng(c,f(f(a))),\ng(c,f(f(f(a)))),\n\u2026 . What distinguishes term rewriting from equational logic is\nthat in term rewriting equations are used as unidirectional reduction\nrules as opposed to equality which works in both directions. Rewrite\nrules have the form t1 \u21d2\nt2 and the basic idea is to look for terms\nt occurring in expressions e such that t\nunifies with t1 with unifier \u03b8 so that the\noccurrence t1\u03b8 in e\u03b8 can be\nreplaced by t2\u03b8. For example, the rewrite\nrule x + 0 \u21d2 x allows the rewriting of\nsucc(succ(0) + 0) as\nsucc(succ(0)).\n\nTo illustrate the main ideas in term rewriting, let us explore an\nexample involving symbolic differentiation (the example and ensuing\ndiscussion are adapted from Chapter 1 of Baader & Nipkow 1998). Let\nder denote the derivative respect to x, let\ny be a variable different from x, and let u\nand v be variables ranging over expressions. We define the\nrewrite system:\n\n\nR1:\nder(x) \u21d2 1 \n\nR2:\nder(y) \u21d2 0 \n\nR3:\nder(u + v) \u21d2\nder(u) + der(v) \n\nR4:\nder(u \u00d7 v) \u21d2 (u\n\u00d7 der(v)) + (der(u) \u00d7\nv) \n\n\nAgain, the symbol \u21d2 indicates that a term matching the left-hand\nside of a rewrite rule should be replaced by the rule\u2019s right-hand\nside. To see the differentiation system at work, let us compute the\nderivative of x \u00d7 x respect to x,\nder(x \u00d7 x):\n\n\nder(x \u00d7 x)\n\u21d2\n(x \u00d7 der(x)) +\n(der(x) \u00d7 x)\n\u00a0\nby R4 \n\n\u00a0\n\u21d2\n(x \u00d7 1) + (der(x) \u00d7\nx)\n\u00a0\nby R1 \n\n\u00a0\n\u21d2\n(x \u00d7 1) + (1 \u00d7 x)\n\u00a0\nby R1 \n\n\nAt this point, since none of the rules (R1)\u2013(R4) applies, no\nfurther reduction is possible and the rewriting process ends. The\nfinal expression obtained is called a normal form,\nand its existence motivates the following question: Is there an\nexpression whose reduction process will never terminate when applying\nthe rules (R1)\u2013(R4)? Or, more generally: Under what conditions a\nset of rewrite rules will always stop, for any given expression, at a\nnormal form after finitely many applications of the rules? This\nfundamental question is called the termination\nproblem of a rewrite system, and we state without proof that the\nsystem (R1)\u2013(R4) meets the termination condition.\n\nThere is the possibility that when reducing an expression, the set of\nrules of a rewrite system could be applied in more than one way. This\nis actually the case in the system (R1)\u2013(R4) where in the\nreduction of der(x \u00d7 x) we could have\napplied R1 first to the second sub-expression in (x \u00d7\nder(x)) + (der(x) \u00d7\nx), as shown below:\n\n\nder(x \u00d7 x)\n\u21d2\n(x \u00d7 der(x)) +\n(der(x) \u00d7 x)\n\u00a0\nby R4 \n\n\u00a0\n\u21d2\n(x \u00d7 der(x)) + (1 \u00d7\nx)\n\u00a0\nby R1 \n\n\u00a0\n\u21d2\n(x \u00d7 1) + (1 \u00d7 x)\n\u00a0\nby R1 \n\n\nFollowing this alternative course of action, the reduction terminates\nwith the same normal form as in the previous case. This fact, however,\nshould not be taken for granted: A rewriting system is said to be\n(globally) confluent if and only if independently of\nthe order in which its rules are applied every expression always ends\nup being reduced to its one and only normal form. It can be shown that\n(R1)\u2013(R4) is confluent and, hence, we are entitled to say:\n\u201cCompute the derivative of an expression\u201d (as\nopposed to simply \u201ca\u201d derivative). Adding more\nrules to a system in an effort to make it more practical can have\nundesired consequences. For example, if we add the rule\n\n\nR5:\nu + 0 \u21d2 u \n\n\nto (R1)\u2013(R4) then we will be able to further reduce certain\nexpressions but at the price of losing confluency. The following\nreductions show that der(x + 0) now has two normal\nforms: the computation\n\n\nder(x + 0)\n\u21d2\nder(x) + der(0)\n\u00a0\nby R3 \n\n\u00a0\n\u21d2\n1 + der(0)\n\u00a0\nby R1 \n\n\ngives one normal form, and\n\n\nder(x + 0)\n\u21d2\nder(x)\n\u00a0\nby R5 \n\n\u00a0\n\u21d2\n1\n\u00a0\nby R1 \n\n\ngives another. Adding the rule\n\n\nR6:\nder(0) \u21d2 0 \n\n\nwould allow the further reduction of 1 + der(0) to 1 + 0 and\nthen, by R5, to 1. Although the presence of this new rule actually\nincreases the number of alternative\npaths\u2014der(x + 0) can now be reduced in four\npossible ways\u2014they all end up with the same normal form, namely\n1. This is no coincidence as it can be shown that (R6) actually\nrestores confluency. This motivates another fundamental question:\nUnder what conditions can a non-confluent system be made into an\nequivalent confluent one? The Knuth-Bendix completion\nalgorithm (Knuth & Bendix 1970) gives a partial answer to this\nquestion.\n\nTerm rewriting, like any other automated deduction method, needs\nstrategies to direct its application. Rippling (Bundy, Stevens &\nHarmelen 1993, Basin & Walsh 1996) is a heuristic that has its\norigins in inductive theorem-proving that uses annotations to\nselectively restrict the rewriting process. The superposition calculus\nis a calculus of equational first-order logic that combines notions\nfrom first-order resolution and Knuth-Bendix ordering equality.\nSuperposition is refutation complete (Bachmair & Ganzinger 1994) and\nis at the heart of a number of theorem provers, most notably the E\nequational theorem prover (Schulz 2004) and Vampire (Voronkov\n1995).\n",
