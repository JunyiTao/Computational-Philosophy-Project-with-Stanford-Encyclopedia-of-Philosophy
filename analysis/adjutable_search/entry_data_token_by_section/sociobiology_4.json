    "main_text": "Central criticisms of Sociobiology and Behavioral Ecology || Adaptationism\n4.1 Adaptationism\n\nPerhaps the most important of all of the criticisms of \u201cPop\nSociobiology\u201d was that it was excessively adaptationist; similar\nsorts of criticisms are leveled at modern descendants of sociobiology,\nsuch as behavioral ecology. Behavioral ecologists, including HBEs, are\nreally methodological adaptationists (Godfrey Smith, 2001), in that\nthey assume that natural selection is optimizing the trait they are\nstudying as a heuristic, in order to establish other things about that\ntrait; as such, no strong commitment about the power of natural\nselection is necessarily required on their part (as discussed\nearlier). This did lead many behavioral ecologists to regard Gould and\nLewontin\u2019s (1979) criticisms as a cautionary tale, rather than\nas properly directed at them\u2014see, for example, Gould and\nLewontin\u2019s objection that adaptationist hypotheses were\nuntestable, which the behavioral ecologists could easily rebut (Mayr,\n1983). Similarly, Parker and Maynard Smith (1990) responded to Gould\nand Lewontin\u2019s objection that adaptationists do not properly\naccount for phylogenetic and developmental constraints; Parker and\nMaynard Smith argued that they are taken into account\u2014even where\ndevelopmental constraints and tradeoffs are not explicitly represented\nin optimality models, they are often built into the strategy set or\nare otherwise implicit in those models. However, it is reasonable to\npoint out that Parker and Maynard Smith\u2019s paper did not fully\nrespond to Gould and Lewontin\u2019s objection: Gould and Lewontin\nrecognized that adaptationist models appeal to constraints; their\nworry was that such constraints are appealed to ad hoc to\nfill in gaps in models, and are not subjected to any external\ntest.\n\nAnother objection to adaptationist methods from Gould and Lewontin\nthat has persisted as a criticism of behavioral ecology is that these\nmethods do not allow scientists to consider non-adaptationist\nexplanations for the traits to which they are applied, such as whether\nthose traits were fixed by drift or are simply side effects of other\ntraits (i.e. whether they are \u201cspandrels\u201d). In principle,\ncorrectly pursued, adaptationist methods can help identify cases where\na trait is a non-adaptation: drift, for example, can be identified by\ncomparing the distribution of traits expected under selection and\nunder drift with actual population distributions (Sober, 2005); the\nquestion is whether the types of methods used in behavioral ecology\nare the most efficient at detecting these cases (Lewens, 2009). Some\nphilosophers have argued that methodological adaptationism is more\npernicious in practice than it looks in principle, because real\nevolutionary social scientists are not good at dropping adaptationist\nhypotheses for a trait even when there is a strong case to be made\nthat they should (see, for example, Lloyd, 2005, esp. Chapter 8). For\nfurther discussion of all these problems, see the entry on\n adaptationism.\n",
