    "main_text": "\n\nThis entry follows the traditional practice of equating political\nobligation with a moral duty to obey the law of one\u2019s country or\nstate. How does one acquire such an obligation, and how many people\nhave really done what is necessary to acquire it? Or is a political\nobligation more a matter of being than of doing\n\u2013 that is, of simply being a member of the country or state in\nquestion? To those questions many answers have been given, and none\nnow commands widespread assent. Indeed, a number of contemporary\npolitical philosophers deny that a satisfactory theory of political\nobligation either has been or can be devised. Others, however,\ncontinue to believe that there is a solution to what is commonly\ncalled \u201cthe problem of political obligation,\u201d and they are\npresently engaged in a lively debate not only with the skeptics but\nalso with one another on the question of which theory, if any,\nprovides the solution to the problem.\n\nThe history of political thought is replete with attempts to provide a\nsatisfactory account of political obligation, from the time of\nSocrates to the present. These attempts have become increasingly\nsophisticated in recent years, but they have brought us no closer to\nagreement on a solution to the problem of political obligation than\nthe efforts of, say, Thomas Hobbes and John Locke in the seventeenth\ncentury. Nor have these sophisticated attempts made it unnecessary to\nlook back to earlier efforts to resolve the problem. On the contrary,\nan appreciation of the troublesome nature of political obligation\nrequires some attention to its place in the history of political\nthought.\n\nThis essay begins, therefore, with a brief history of the problem of\npolitical obligation. It then turns, in Part 2, to the conceptual\nquestions raised by political obligation, such as what it means for an\nobligation to be political. In Part 3 the focus is\non the skeptics, with particular attention to the self-proclaimed\nphilosophical anarchists, who deny that political obligations exist\nyet do not maintain that the state is necessarily unjustifiable. Part\n4 surveys the leading contenders among the various theories of\npolitical obligation now on offer, and Part 5 concludes the essay with\na consideration of recent proposals for pluralistic or \u201cmultiple\nprinciple\u201d approaches.\n",
