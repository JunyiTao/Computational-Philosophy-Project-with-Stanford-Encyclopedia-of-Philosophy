    "main_text": "Philosophical Issues || Putnam's Model-Theoretic Argument\n4. Conclusion\n\n\nWe close this entry with a brief recap of two of the main points\nthat we've tried to emphasize. First, from a purely mathematical\nstandpoint, there's no conflict between Cantor's Theorem and the\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem Theorems. There's a technical solution to\nSkolem's Paradox which explains why the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem Theorems\npose no problems for either naive forms of set-theoretic realism or\nvarious forms of axiomatized set theory. Hence, there's no chance of\nusing the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems by themselves to\ngenerate substantial Skolemite conclusions. Of course, there are still\nsome interesting technical issues which live in the neighborhood of\nSkolem's Paradox. For example, we can look at how the paradox plays out\nin the context of particular first-order models; we can examine the\ndegree to which various kinds of non-first-order logic are susceptible\nto the paradox; and we can try to isolate the precise features of\nfirst-order logic which allow the paradox to apply to it. Each of these\ntopics is clearly related to Skolem's Paradox, and each raises\nquestions about the relationship between model theory and set theory\nwhich are well worth exploring. But, considered simply in and of\nitself, Skolem's Paradox poses no threats to classical set theory.\n\n\nSecond, if we come to Skolem's Paradox with antecedent doubts about\nclassical set theory\u2014e.g., the kinds of doubts which lie behind\nsome of the more sophisticated reconstructions of Skolem's original\nargument, the kinds of doubts which lie behind the more plausible\nversions of step 1 in the Skolemite argument, or the kinds of doubts\nabout semantic determinacy which lie behind Putnam's model-theoretic\nargument\u2014then we may well be able to parley Skolem's Paradox into\nsome kind of interesting philosophical conclusion. Of course there will\nstill be challenges here: we need to account for the status of the\nbackground theories in which we prove the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\ntheorems, we need to explain the special significance of\nfirst-order axiomatizations of set theory, and we may need to\nexplain how we can identify elements across various models of set\ntheory. In principle, however, these kinds of sophisticated uses of\nSkolem's Paradox are not precluded by the technical solution to the\nparadox that was mentioned in the last paragraph. Nor should this fact\nbe all that surprising: if we put enough philosophy into our analysis\nof Skolem's Paradox, then we should expect to get at least a little\nphilosophy out.\n",
