In this paragraph such an exotic example, viz.\nthe combinatorial hierarchy, is briefly presented. In this approach\nthe focus is not on the equations of physics themselves, but on the\nphysical constants occurring in them, such as the velocity of light\n\\(c\\), the Planck constant \\(h\\), the mass of the electron \\(m_{e}\\),\nand so on. As these values are necessarily finite, it seems worthwhile\nto investigate whether a finitist approach can explain why these\nconstants have the values they happen to have. Such approaches are\nsometimes referred to as \u201cnumber games\u201d.\n\nLet me give one very simple example. Starting from a universe\nconsisting of a finite number of bits, i.e., either 0 or 1, a basic\noperation is introduced, viz., to make a \u201cdiscrimination\u201d.\nTo express this operation, another operation is needed: addition\nmodulo 2: \\(0 + 0 = 1 + 1 = 0\\) and \\(0 + 1 = 1 + 0 = 1\\). If the\noutcome is 0, then the elements of the sum are not distinguished, else\nthey are. Look now at sets that contain 0 and/or 1, and such that, if\ntwo elements are distinguishable, that element belongs to the set as\nwell. There are exactly 3 \\((= 2^{2}-1)\\) such sets: \\(\\{0\\}, \\{1\\}\\)\nand \\(\\{0,1\\}\\). If these 3 elements are now taken as a new basis\ninstead of 0 and 1, a clever construction shows that 7 \\((= 2^{3}-1)\\)\nsuch sets exists and, in a next step, 127 \\((= 2^{7}-1)\\) pops up. Now\n\\(3 + 7 + 127 = 137\\) and that number is close to the electromagnetic\ncoupling constant.\n\nThe success of this program has been rather modest as these models do\nnot connect easily to existing physical theories. A self-contained\npresentation of this program is to be found in Bastin & Kilmister\n(1995). There is a very strong similarity with the work of A.S.\nEddington. Not very surprisingly, a presentation of the work of\nEddington on his fundamental theory has been written by Kilmister\n(1994).\n",
