    "main_text": "Theory of History || Early Formulations\n3.2 Early Formulations\n\nIn his \u201cTheses on Feuerbach\u201d (1845) Marx provides\na background to what would become his theory of history by stating his\nobjections to \u201call hitherto existing\u201d materialism and\nidealism, understood as types of philosophical theories. Materialism\nis complimented for understanding the physical reality of the world,\nbut is criticised for ignoring the active role of the human subject in\ncreating the world we perceive. Idealism, at least as developed by\nHegel, understands the active nature of the human subject, but\nconfines it to thought or contemplation: the world is created through\nthe categories we impose upon it. Marx combines the insights of both\ntraditions to propose a view in which human beings do indeed create\n\u2014or at least transform\u2014the world they find themselves in,\nbut this transformation happens not in thought but through actual\nmaterial activity; not through the imposition of sublime concepts but\nthrough the sweat of their brow, with picks and shovels. This\nhistorical version of materialism, which, according to Marx,\ntranscends and thus rejects all existing philosophical thought, is the\nfoundation of Marx\u2019s later theory of history. As Marx puts it in\nthe \u201c1844 Manuscripts\u201d, \u201cIndustry is the actual\nhistorical relationship of nature \u2026 to man\u201d\n(MECW 3: 303). This thought, derived from reflection on the\nhistory of philosophy, together with his experience of social and\neconomic realities, as a journalist, sets the agenda for all\nMarx\u2019s future work.\n\nIn The German Ideology manuscripts, Marx and Engels contrast\ntheir new materialist method with the idealism that had characterised\nprevious German thought. Accordingly, they take pains to set out the\n\u201cpremises of the materialist method\u201d. They start, they\nsay, from \u201creal human beings\u201d, emphasising that human\nbeings are essentially productive, in that they must produce their\nmeans of subsistence in order to satisfy their material needs. The\nsatisfaction of needs engenders new needs of both a material and\nsocial kind, and forms of society arise corresponding to the state of\ndevelopment of human productive forces. Material life determines, or\nat least \u201cconditions\u201d social life, and so the primary\ndirection of social explanation is from material production to social\nforms, and thence to forms of consciousness. As the material means of\nproduction develop, \u201cmodes of co-operation\u201d or economic\nstructures rise and fall, and eventually communism will become a real\npossibility once the plight of the workers and their awareness of an\nalternative motivates them sufficiently to become revolutionaries.\n",
