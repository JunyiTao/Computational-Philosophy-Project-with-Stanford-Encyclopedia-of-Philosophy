Interestingly, specialized\nstudies in animal welfare, in biology, adopt similar methods as\nwelfare economics to estimate animal preferences and conceptualize\nvarious approaches to their needs and their well-being (e.g., Appleby\net al. 2018). Many arguments being developed against the current\nfarming practices are still based on anthropocentric considerations\nsuch as climate change and ecosystem services. But the idea of carving\na place in the social welfare function for animals, alongside their\nfellow humans, is gaining ground (Johansson-Stenman 2018, Carlier and\nTreich 2020, Espinosa and Treich 2021; for the opposite view, see\nEichner and Pethig 2006). Budolfson and Spears (2020) propose a way to\ncompute an inclusive utilitarian social welfare function based on a\ndistinction between well-being potential and relative realized\nwell-being.\n",
