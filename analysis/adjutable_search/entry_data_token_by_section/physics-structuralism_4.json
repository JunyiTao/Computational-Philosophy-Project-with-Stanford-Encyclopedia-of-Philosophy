    "main_text": "The problem of theoretical terms || Structuralistic solutions of the problem of theoretical terms\n3.2 Structuralistic solutions of the problem of theoretical terms\n\nThere are various ways to cope with this problem. One could try to\nunmask it as a pseudo-problem. Or one could try to accept the problem\nas part of the usual way science works, albeit not in the clean manner\nphilosophers would like it. The structuralistic programs, however,\nagree that this is a non-trivial problem to be solved and devise\nmeta-theoretical machinery to enable its solution. They further agree\non dividing the vocabulary of the theory \\(T\\) into \\(T\\)-theoretical\nand \\(T\\)-non-theoretical terms, the latter being provided from\noutside the theory.\n3.2.1 Sneed\u2019s solution\n\nIn the Sneedean approach the \u201cempirical claim\u201d of the\ntheory is formulated by using an existential quantifier for the\n\\(T\\)-theoretical terms (i.e., in terms of the \u201cRamsey\nsentence\u201d for \\(T)\\). In our above example, Newton\u2019s law\nfor gravitational forces would be reformulated as: \u201cThere exist\nan inertial system and constants \\(G, m_i, m_{gi}\\) such that for each\nparticle the product of its mass times its acceleration equals the sum\nof the gravitational forces as given above.\u201d This removes the\ncircularity but leaves open the question of content. Here the\nstructuralists \u00e0 la Sneed would argue that the empirical claim\nof the theory \\(T'\\) has to contain all the laws of the theory as well\nas higher-order laws, called \u201cconstraints\u201d. In our\nexample, the constraints would be statements such as \u201call\nparticles have the same inertial and gravitational masses and the\ngravitational constant assumes the same value in all models of the\ntheory.\u201d The theory would thereby acquire more content and\nbecome non-vacuous.\n3.2.2 Ludwig\u2019s solution\n\nAlthough Ludwig\u2019s meta-theoretical framework is slightly\ndifferent, the first part of his solution is essentially equivalent to\nthe above one. On the other hand, he proposes a stronger program\n(\u201caxiomatic basis of a physical theory\u201d) which proceeds by\nconsidering an equivalent form \\(T\\)* of a theory \\(T\\) in which all\n\\(T\\)-theoretical concepts are eliminated by explicit definitions.\nThis seems to be at variance with older results about the\nnon-definability of theoretical terms, but a closer inspection removes\nthe apparent contradiction. For example, the concept of\n\u201cmass\u201d may be non-definable in a theory dealing only with\nsingle orbits of a mechanical system, but definable in a theory\ncontaining all possible orbits of that system.\n\nHowever, to formulate the axiomatic basis of a real theory, not just a\ntoy model, is a non-trivial task and typically requires one or two\nbooks; see the examples Ludwig (1985, 1987) and Schmidt (1979).\n",
