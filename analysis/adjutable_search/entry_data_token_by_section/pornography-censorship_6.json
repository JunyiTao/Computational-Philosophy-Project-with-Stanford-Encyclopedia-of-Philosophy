Ongoing Debate: Liberals and Feminists\n\nDespite the efforts of anti-pornography feminists, many traditional\nliberal defenders of pornography remain unconvinced. They typically\ncontinue to maintain either that pornography does not cause harm to\nwomen (in the relevant, usually narrow, sense of \u201charm\u201d),\nor they admit that pornography probably does cause some harm to women\u2019s\ninterests, but deny that this harm is sufficiently great to offset the\ndangers inherent in censorship and to justify the violation of the\nrights of pornographers and would-be consumers.\n",
