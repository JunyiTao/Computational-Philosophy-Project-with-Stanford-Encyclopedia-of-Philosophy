    "main_text": "\n\nMartin Luther (1483\u20131546) is the central figure of the\nProtestant Reformation. Whilst he is primarily seen as a theologian,\nthe philosophical interest and impact of his ideas is also\nsignificant, so that he arguably deserves to be ranked as highly\nwithin philosophy as other theologians in the Christian tradition,\nsuch as Augustine or Aquinas. Nonetheless, in Luther\u2019s case this\nmay seem more problematic, as his attitude to philosophy and indeed\nreason can be hostile and dismissive. On closer inspection, however,\nit is clear that his position is more nuanced than that, and requires\ncontextualisation: for his objection is only to reason put to certain\ntheological ends, while his own thought is deeply steeped in the\nphilosophical tradition, and contributed to it. At the same time,\nLuther\u2019s ideas had a fundamental influence on northern European\nphilosophers who came after him, such as Leibniz, Kant, Hegel,\nSchelling, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Feuerbach, and Heidegger, all of\nwhom worked within a broadly Lutheran context, and against the\nbackground of central Lutheran assumptions, often inculcated in them\nthrough their upbringing and\n education.[1]\n\nSeveral key issues in Luther\u2019s work make him of interest to\nphilosophers and not just theologians or Reformation historians, and\nwill be covered in this entry: his conception of the relation between\ntheology and philosophy, and the place of reason in that relation; his\nnegative conception of Aristotle and the Aristotelian tradition, and\nhis relation to the nominalist alternative; his conception of divine\nand human freedom; and his conception of ethics and of social and\npolitical life. Luther\u2019s influence on subsequent philosophers in\nthe Lutheran tradition is considered in more detail in the\nseparate entry on \n Luther\u2019s influence on philosophy.\n",
