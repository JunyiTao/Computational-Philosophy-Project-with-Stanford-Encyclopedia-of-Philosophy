    "main_text": "Problems with Reductionism || Context-Dependence of Molecular Features (one-many)\n4.1 Context-Dependence of Molecular Features (one-many)\n\nOne key challenge for reduction stems from the fact that the effect of\na molecular entity or mechanism may depend strongly on the\ncontext in which it occurs (Hull 1972, 1974, 1976; see also\nWimsatt 1979, Gilbert and Sarkar 2000, Laubichler and Wagner 2001).\nClassical geneticists were fully aware of the fact that a phenotype is\nbrought about by the interaction of several (many) classical\ngenes\u2014the same allele may lead to two different phenotypes if\noccurring in two individuals with a different overall genotype (Waters\n2004). Although one-many phenomena have been known for some time, it\nis now a robust empirical generalization that a molecular pathway may\nhave different effects in different cellular contexts; the same\npathway can be involved in different functions in different species or\nin different parts of an individual (Gilbert and Sarkar 2000,\nLaubichler and Wagner 2001, Burian\n 2004).[7]\n These different contexts include developmental and physiological\nhistory, which condition the behavior of molecular pathways (Brigandt\n2006, Kirschner 2005). Even the amino acid sequence produced by a\nmolecular gene may depend on both DNA elements outside of the gene and\nnon-genetic factors, which means the same gene can code for distinct\nproducts in different cells or different states of a cell (Griffiths\nand Stotz 2013, Stotz 2006a,b). Thus, there are one-many relations\nbetween molecular kinds and higher level kinds: a molecular mechanism\ncan causally lead to or be part of different higher level states\ndepending on the\n context.[8]\n\nA common conclusion drawn from these one-many relations is that the\nparts and molecular components of an\n organism\n have to be understood in terms of the organized whole in which they\noccur (recall Kant\u2019s regulative principle;\n Section 2).\n Although biologists view the decomposition of a system into\nlower-level parts as reductionist (an instance of methodological\nreduction, see\n Section 1),\n they often construe the attempt to understand how the parts are\norganized to bring about the system-level properties as a synthetic,\nnon-reductionist endeavor (Bechtel 2010, 2013). Paying attention to\ncontext and organismal organization is a valid methodological\nrecommendation; however, it is less clear why this is an argument\nagainst epistemic reduction. For example, proponents of\ntheory reduction, such as Nagel (1961) and Schaffner (1976), have\nreplied that a molecular reduction can take the relations of parts and\nthe context of molecular processes into account. For example, one can\nspecify the relevant context as initial conditions in the molecular\npremises from which the higher level state is to be deduced\n(Frost-Arnold 2004).\n\nContext-dependence is primarily a problem for models of theory\nreduction; some models of explanatory reduction take the organismal\ncontext for granted without being committed to reducing it molecularly\n(as seen in explanations offered in developmental biology). Sciences\ncan avail themselves of\n causes as difference makers\n relative to a given causal context (Waters 2007, Woodward 2003). Both\nexperimental investigation and explanation can focus on one among many\ncauses, relegating everything else to the context or background (which\nis often held fixed in experimental studies). For example, if the loss\nin function of a particular gene leads to an abnormal phenotype in a\nknock-out experiment, this gene is one causal factor\nimplicated in the development of the normal phenotype. Explanations\nappealing to this gene\u2014as a salient causal factor relative to a\ncontext\u2014are genuinely explanatory even if other genes involved\nin the phenotype are unknown and the cellular context for the gene is\nnot yet understood (Waters 1994, 2007). If molecular biologists\ndiscover that the same mechanism produces different effects in\ndistinct contexts and only one of these effects is the target of\ninquiry, a part of the mechanism\u2019s context becomes epistemically\nrelevant and can be included in the explanation (Delehanty 2005).\n\nIn contrast, theory reduction (such as the Nagel-Schaffner approach)\nis committed to deducing a description of the higher level phenomenon\nfrom purely molecular premises. In order to deduce even a single\nhigher level statement (a fortiori a total higher level\ntheory on Schaffner\u2019s account), the premises must contain (in\naddition to the lower level laws) a specification of the total lower\nlevel context\u2014every feature that has some\ncausal impact. This includes features internal to an organism and some\nparts of its environment. While explanatory reduction can appeal to\nparticular causes relative to a background that is not molecularly\nspecified, a logical deduction (as required by theory reduction) can\ngo through only if the total causal context is contained in the\n premises.[9]\n A molecular characterization of the total context is in principle\npossible due to ontological reduction: for any higher level state\nthere is always a total molecular configuration that determines this\nhigher level phenomenon. However, this entails a retreat to the\n\u201cin principle\u201d possibility of a molecular derivation; not\nonly is a molecular specification of the total context currently\nunavailable but it may not be forthcoming in the future (Hull 1972,\n1974,\n 1976).[10]\n In this respect, accounts of explanatory reduction have a clear\nadvantage over models of theory reduction because the former are\ncommitted neither to formal derivation nor the assumption that the\nexplanans of the reductive explanation involves only\nmolecularly characterized notions.\n\nAlthough context-dependence is not a problem for many models of\nexplanatory reduction, issues can arise for some models of mechanistic\nexplanation. A mechanistic approach decomposes a system into\ncomponents and scrutinizes the functioning of each component in\nisolation (where possible). However, a mechanistic explanation must\nalso epistemically \u201crecompose\u201d the mechanism behavior (the\nexplanandum) from these component functions (Bechtel 2010,\nBechtel and Abrahamsen 2009). There are molecular systems consisting\nof highly interconnected and functionally integrated networks whose\ncomplex organization does not permit a recomposition of the system\nbehavior from the component functions studied in isolation (Green et\nal. 2018, Kaiser 2015). The functioning of individual components is\ntransformed by the many influences of the other components. This\nempirical situation also is important because it stands behind many\ninstances where molecular biologists claim a limit of\n\u201creduction\u201d\u2014these complex system interactions lead\nto emergence (in some sense). This highlights that biologists\nfrequently attempt to account for mechanism functioning or system\ndynamics and not just mereological or structural constitution (e.g.,\nreducing the Mendelian kind \u201cgene\u201d to biochemical\nkinds).\n\nJason Robert\u2019s (2004) treatment of explanation and methodology\nin\n developmental biology\n describes what is probably the main valid point stemming from the\ncontext-dependence of molecular features. While acknowledging the\nlegitimacy of reductionist research strategies that isolate molecular\ncauses relative to a background held fixed for experimental purposes,\nRobert emphasizes that this methodology does not license an inference\nto an exclusively reductionist position where all explanatorily\nrelevant causes are molecular. That developmental genetics uncovers\nvarious differences between individuals that are due to differences in\ngene expression does not entail that genes are the only factors\nrelevant in ontogeny. Since genetic research holds other cellular and\norganismal factors fixed, the causal influence of these non-genetic\nresources is simply not assessed by this research method. It\nbegs the question against those who maintain that some explanations of\ndevelopment must invoke higher level features to assert that the\norganismal context can always be described molecularly. For example,\nan appeal to developmental genetics research success alone is\ninadequate for reducing cellular context to molecular causes because\nthe discovery of genetic causes occurs against a fixed organismal\nbackground (Robert 2004). The dependence of molecular features on\ncellular and organismal contexts poses problems for theory reduction\napproaches maintaining that higher level phenomena can be deduced from\npurely molecular premises. (It is also a problem for claims that the\nembryo can be computed from a purely molecular specification of the\nfertilized egg, as endorsed by Rosenberg 1997; see Keller 2002, ch.\n9.) Thus, there are limitations on the kinds of inferences that can be\ndrawn from reductionist research strategies. What remains missing from\nmany philosophical discussions critical of reduction is an explicit\naccount of methodological strategies and epistemological frameworks\nthat both capture actual scientific reasoning and offer an alternative\nto reductionism (Love 2008a; see\n Section 5).\n",
