    "main_text": "Language Ontology || The Case against English and Other Folk Languages\n1.2 The Case against English and Other Folk Languages\n\nThe folk, and plenty of self-proclaimed experts, tend to operate with\nan ontology of social languages that most linguists reject. This folk\nontology includes English, Hungarian, Tagalog, Old Norse, etc., and\ncommitment to this ontology has real-world effects, which politicians\nare sensitive to and which sociolinguists can study. But the objects\nthemselves, as opposed to the folk\u2019s beliefs in and about them,\nare generally regarded, by linguists anyway, as fictional or\nideological. Although linguists will inevitably talk of\n\u201cHungarian\u201d and the like, they tend to take themselves as\nusing a convenient shorthand for \u201cthe idiolect of some typical\ninhabitant of Hungary\u201d.\n\nGrounds for rejecting folk ontologies of language vary. Some argue\nthat specifying a folk language\u2019s properties is, unavoidably, a\nprescriptive (and so unscientific) exercise. An example sometimes used\nto illustrate this charge is the meaning of English word\n\u201clivid\u201d. Most dictionaries give its meanings as\n\u201cbluish\u201d or \u201cpale\u201d, in deference to its\ncomplex etymology. Most English speakers lean towards thinking it\nmeans red, after the idiomatic expression \u201clivid with\nrage\u201d and the belief that rage makes a person red. Similarly,\nand to the consternation of many who claim to know what English really\nis, English speakers regularly split infinitives, and see the use of\n\u201chopefully\u201d in (1) as no less acceptable than its use in\n(2), despite being a \u201cGermanism\u201d.\n\n(1)Hopefully, all the passengers will escape by helicopter.\n(2) The passengers looked hopefully at the helicopter.\n\n\nThe problem with these and similar judgements (Crystal 2007 recounts\ntheir history in the case of English) is not that they are obnoxiously\nconservative, a tool for social exclusion. Often they don\u2019t play\nthis role. Some dictionaries now include red as a possible meaning of\n\u201clivid\u201d, for example, but this, too, is a normative stance\nand it is normativity, not conservativism in particular, that is\nincompatible with a scientific stance. Even liberal views on\nlinguistic acceptability (e.g., that it is okay to end sentences with\na preposition) are prescriptions. In so far as such normativity is\nunavoidable in the determination of the properties of English and\nother languages in the folk ontology, these languages have no place in\nscience (save as a fictional object for sociological\ninvestigation\u2014because belief in the fiction has social\neffects\u2014or as a useful shorthand).\n\nA distinct but related case against the folk ontology is that the\ndelineation of a population as speakers of a single language is\ninvariably driven by geo-political considerations. Serbo-Croatian and\nthe Czechoslovak languages endured only as long as nationalist\npolitics required them to, and ceased to be almost overnight, without\nany major change in how people spoke. Some dialects of the Netherlands\nare closer in their characteristics to dialects in neighboring Germany\nthan they are to dialects spoken on the Netherlands coast, despite\nbeing grouped with the latter but not the former as variants of the\nsame language, Dutch. The concern here is not well captured in the\nobservation that languages in the folk sense are fuzzy. The special\nsciences are replete with fuzziness. Rather, the individuation\nconditions seem arbitrary from a linguistic perspective. The same\narguments against languages in the folk sense apply at the level of\ndialects in the folk sense. Cockneys, and hence speakers of the\ncockney dialect, are traditionally required to have been born within\nearshot of the bells of Bow Church in east London, but noise pollution\nand demographic change have rendered that definition absurd. No matter\nhow fine-grained a version of the folk ontology one seeks out, similar\nproblems will recur.\n\nRuling out folk-ontological languages does not necessarily push us\ninto an idiolectal direction. Nothing said so far speaks against the\npossibility of technical notions of a social language that side-step\nthe normativity or arbitrariness built into their folksy cousins\n(assuming such side-stepping is indeed needed). Lewis\u2019s account\nof language as a convention is, arguably, in this category.\n",
