    "main_text": "Further Developments || The Return of Normativity to Hermeneutics\n8.4 Hermeneutics and New Realism\n\nRecent developments in hermeneutics have arisen in response to\n\u2018new realism.\u2019 This school of thought is represented\nespecially by philosophers Maurizio Ferraris and Markus Gabriel, and\ninvites comparisons with the \u2018speculative realism\u2019 of\nphilosophers such as Quentin Meillassoux and Graham Harman (see\nFerraris 2012, Gabriel 2015, Gabriel 2020, Meillassoux 2008; Harman\n2018). The new orientation toward realism is characterized, first of\nall, by a rejection of a common thesis of postmodern and radical\nconstructivism: the position that our interpretations are constitutive\nof what we otherwise call reality. To this extent, the new interest in\nrealism is compatible with other forms of realism. Yet, new realism\nopposes not only radical constructivism but also a basic tenet of\nmetaphysical realism: the idea that reality is comprised exclusively\nof mind-independent things. One of the most influential approaches of\nsuch new-realist opposition against metaphysical realism is found in\nGabriel. He makes a distinction between metaphysics and ontology, and\nargues in his new realist ontology that what we usually associate with\nmind, namely, our descriptions or interpretations of things, are no\nless real than what they relate to. Such descriptions or\ninterpretations are rather distinguished by their function, which is\nto individuate (Gabriel 2015, 9\u201311).\n\nThe rise of this orientation toward realism has garnered significant\nattention in its own right. Especially important for contemporary\nhermeneutics, however, is that this new orientation toward realism has\nbeen an impetus for new developments. At one extreme, the rise of\nrealism has recently led Gianni Vattimo not only to defend his\npostmodern hermeneutics against realism, but, moreover to develop a\npolemical critique of the motivations, philosophical and otherwise, to\npursue realism. In this, Vattimo maintains that the rise of realism is\nmotivated, in part, by a conservative reactionism against the\nconsequences of postmodernism. He writes, for example, that among\nother roots of realism is \u201cthe fundamental neurosis that follows\nthe late-industrial society as the regressive reaction of defense\nagainst the postmodern Babel of languages and values\u201d (Vattimo\n2016, 77).\n\nOther developments within hermeneutics have been much more favorable\ntoward the renewed interest in realism. Some philosophers, such as\nG\u00fcnter Figal and Anton Koch, have discerned important affinities\nbetween hermeneutics and new realism, and, in turn, have developed\npositions that they have identified as \u2018hermeneutical\nrealism.\u2019 Hermeneutical realism opposes the postmodern view that\ninterpretations constitute reality, maintaining, by contrast, that\ninterpretive experience belongs to reality. Figal, in his\nhermeneutical realism, develops his realistic approach principally in\nterms of the phenomenological problem of appearance. In this, he\nfocuses on space, grasped as what first places us in referential\nrelations to objects, and, with this, makes available interpretive\npossibilities to determine the sense of them (Figal, 2009, 2010 and\n2015). Koch, for his part, develops his hermeneutical realism on the\nbasis of motifs found in German Idealism, arguing for the necessity of\nthe subject, grasped in its spatio-temporal, corporeal, and living\nsubjectivity, as what makes things interpretable (as he has it,\nreadable and translatable) (Koch 2016 and 2019). Thus, on his view,\nwhile real things are independent of individual interpretations, such\nthings are not independent of being interpretable in general.\n\nFinally, hermeneutical realism has also led to novel research on\nclassical figures in hermeneutics. Whereas Vattimo, for example, sees\nin Gadamer the seeds of his postmodern hermeneutics (see Vattimo,\n\u201cStory of a Comma\u201d), Figal, by contrast, brings into focus\nthe realism of Gadamer\u2019s concern for the substantiveness\n(Sachlichkeit) of interpretive experience (see Figal 2010, 2).\nMoreover, some philosophers have found that hermeneutical realism\nsheds light on central motifs of the later Heidegger (Keiling\n2018).\n",
