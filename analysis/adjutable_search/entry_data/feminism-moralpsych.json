    "preamble": "\n\nMoral psychology, broadly construed, deals with issues relating to\nmotivation of moral action. More specifically, it concerns how we see\nor fail to see moral issues, why we act or fail to act morally, and\nwhether and to what extent we are responsible for our actions.\nFundamentally, it is concerned with our moral agency, the kind of\nbeings we are or ought to be, morally speaking.\n\nFeminist moral psychology deals with what feminists, in particular,\nhave contributed to the field of moral psychology, or the ways in\nwhich their approach to these issues is motivated by feminist\nconcerns, especially in connection to understanding and attempting to\nend women\u2019s oppression. The feminist contribution to moral\npsychology has been at least three-fold. First, some feminists\nemphasize the role of emotion in action; in particular, they stress\nthe motive of care in prompting action. They do so for the reason that\nemotion in general, and care in particular, have been ignored or\ndenigrated in traditional moral theory due to their association with\nwomen. They believe that if we are to end women\u2019s oppression, we\nshould incorporate into our philosophical theories things associated\nwith women and with the feminine and so previously left out. Other\nfeminists, though, worry about how care in particular can be harmful\nto women, and believe that incorporating care into moral theory will\nperpetuate women\u2019s oppression. Still other feminists challenge\nthe internalist thesis that motivation is necessarily present in the\nrational agent who recognizes a reason to act morally. Second,\nfeminist attention to oppression has led those feminists working in\nthe field of moral psychology to acknowledge the role of systematic\noppression in the psychology of both victims of oppression and\noppressors themselves. One issue is the role that patriarchy plays in\na person\u2019s motivation and subsequent action. How does patriarchy\naffect women\u2019s desires? Can women be autonomous if their desires\nare deformed by patriarchy? Does the satisfaction of women\u2019s\ndeformed desires contribute to their own oppression? What motivates\nthose who perform sexist acts that contribute to women\u2019s\noppression? A related issue, the third that feminists working in the\nfield of moral psychology are concerned with, is that of\nresponsibility. To what extent are we responsible for our actions when\nthey are motivated by desires deformed by patriarchy? Are victims of\noppression in any way responsible for their own oppression? Are they\nresponsible for resisting oppression? Are members of the dominant\nsocial group responsible for understanding oppression, and how can\nthey come to understand it? Are men collectively responsible for\nwomen\u2019s oppression, even when it is not the case that each man\nharbors sexist intentions? \n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Moral Motivation\n\nThroughout the history of ethics, many moral philosophers have been\nconcerned with the agent\u2019s psychology, or what motivates an\nagent to act. Three stand out as the most prominent foes or friends of\nfeminists: Hobbes, Hume, and Kant. Hobbes believed that self-interest\nmotivates all action, including moral action. For Hobbes, all of a\nperson\u2019s actions aim at the person\u2019s own good as\ndetermined by that person, and rationality requires acting in ways\nthat promote one\u2019s own good, which, for Hobbes, amounts to\nacting in ways that best satisfy one\u2019s desires. Each rational\nperson\u2019s strongest desire is for self-preservation, which\nrationality dictates should never be sacrificed. Thus self-interest or\ndesire-satisfaction prompts action, and both morality and rationality\ndictate acting accordingly. While Hume agreed with Hobbes that reason\nby itself cannot motivate action, he disagreed with Hobbes about the\nmotive that prompted action, believing that instead of self-interest,\nthe feeling or sentiment of sympathy or benevolence is necessary for\nprompting moral action. Reason\u2019s role is to determine the means\nto our ends, not set the ends themselves, which are set by sentiment.\nKant believed, against Hobbes and Hume, that not only could reason\nitself prompt action, but that it is the source of our moral nature.\nReason, for Kant, needs to master desire, rather than dictate the\nsatisfaction of desire, in order for the agent to be autonomous (see,\nfor example, Deigh 1992, 1\u20132).\n\nFeminists have weighed in on these debates. One main charge made by\nsome feminists is that emotion has been associated historically with\nwomen, and for this reason moral philosophers, most of whom have been\nmen, have either ignored it, denigrated it, or included it in moral\ntheory but only as construed in a typically masculine way (Baier,\n1987b; Gilligan 1982 and 1987; Held 1987; Tuana 1992, 1\u201312 and\n113\u2013121). Further, since reason has been associated with men, it\nhas been valorized by the same theories. These feminists imply that\ntraditional moral theory is sexist. Kant, by insisting that reason\nshould master desire, denigrates emotion, and by insisting that reason\nalone can prompt action, ultimately leaves out emotion from morality.\nHobbes, by appealing to the motive of self-interest in his description\nof persons in a State of Nature from which morality must be derived,\nconstrues emotion in a typically masculine way, as the motive\nappropriate for prompting actions with strangers in the so-called\npublic sphere with which men have traditionally been associated\n(Calhoun 1988). Some of the feminists at issue favor Hume\u2019s view\nthat benevolence or sympathy is necessary for prompting moral action\n(Baier 1987a). Some of them believe that one step in the direction of\nending women\u2019s oppression, a goal they share with all feminists,\nis to incorporate into our philosophical theories those things that\nhave been heretofore excluded precisely because of their association\nwith women (Baier 1987b; Held, 1987). Such feminists reject both\nKant\u2019s view, that reason should master desire, and\nHobbes\u2019s view, that self-interest is the motive that prompts\nmoral action, and favor including in moral theory those motives that\nhave traditionally been associated with women. These are motives\nappropriate to prompting action with intimates in the so-called\nprivate sphere to which (at least white, middle class) women have\nhistorically been relegated. Foremost among them is the motive of\ncare, exhibited by women who have been charged with the role of\nraising children. But feminists are not univocal in their views about\nthe role of emotion in moral theory. Other feminists caution that\nincorporating \u201cfeminine\u201d emotions into moral theory risks\nperpetuating women\u2019s oppression by leaving unchallenged the view\nthat women are essentially emotional beings, and men essentially\nrational beings (Tronto 1993, 241\u2013247; Tuana 1992,\n115\u2013116).\n\nFeminists\u2019s responses on both sides of the issue have been\nmultifarious. It is important to note that some philosophers,\nindependent of feminist motivations, challenge the charge that\ntraditional moral theory denigrates or ignores emotion, arguing that\nit can at least make room for it. For instance, Barbara Herman (1981)\nand Marcia Baron (1984) argue that Kant need not, or even should not,\nexclude emotion altogether from his theory. Herman argues against the\nview that in order for an act to have moral worth, it must be done\nwithout the presence of any inclination, but only from the moral\nmotive, or, for the sake of duty. Herman agrees that acts having moral\nworth must be done from the moral motive, but argues that the received\ninterpretation of Kant is wrong in assuming that inclination must not\nbe present. Regarding morally obligatory actions, Herman argues that\ninclination may be present as long as the agent\u2019s final motive\nis the moral one. Regarding morally permissible actions, Herman argues\nthat the moral motive functions as a limiting condition, screening out\ninclinations that take as their object action conflicting with the\nCategorical Imperative. In the ordinary case, the agent has both\ninclination and the moral motive present, with inclination giving the\nmoral motive its object. Baron takes the role of inclination one step\nfurther, arguing that inclination must be present in the\nperfectly moral person. This is because Baron understands the moral\nmotive in a Kantian way rather than strictly as Kant understood it, as\na commitment to morality instead of something we must hold before our\nminds each time we act. Thus it can function either as a primary\nmotive, motivating the agent without the aid of inclination, or as a\nsecondary motive, as a commitment to doing what is right, telling the\nagent to act as inclination directs. But these modest attempts to\nincorporate emotion into a moral theory that at first blush seems to\nignore emotion or makes reason its master do not address the feminist\ncharge that \u201cfeminine\u201d motivation is left out of or\ndenigrated by traditional moral theory, and is so because of its\nassociation with women.\n\nOther philosophers writing particularly from a feminist view favor\nendorsing any traditional moral theory that incorporates\n\u201cfeminine\u201d motivation. Annette Baier favors a Humean\naccount over Kant\u2019s, arguing that Hume is the\n\u201cwoman\u2019s moral theorist\u201d(1987). While Baier\nacknowledges that Hume had less than feminist views since he saw women\nas weaker than men in mind and body, she believes that nonetheless\nHume\u2019s theory squares with women\u2019s moral wisdom, both in\nthe concept of morality that many women have, and in their experiences\nthat lead them to have it (38). Baier contrasts Hume\u2019s moral\ntheory with Kant\u2019s, specifically in connection to Carol\nGilligan\u2019s conclusions about men\u2019s and women\u2019s moral\nreasoning (see below; 1982). Gilligan is a psychologist who set out to\ncollect data about women\u2019s moral reasoning, which she noted was\nnot reflected in the experiments conducted just on males by another\npsychologist, Lawrence Kohlberg (see the entry on\n feminist ethics).\n Baier notes the following differences between Kant and Hume, which\nshe takes to resemble those Gilligan suggested between the women she\nstudied and Kohlberg\u2019s men. Kant makes morality a matter of\nobedience to universal law through which we obtain freedom, but Hume\nmakes it a matter of cultivating character traits directed at peace of\nmind and integrity; Kant takes reason to be the fundamental moral\ncapacity, and Hume takes sympathy, or the heart\u2019s responses to\nparticular persons, to be this capacity; Kant takes the rules of\njustice to be morally binding, while Hume emphasizes convention and\neradicating contradictions in the passions of sympathetic persons.\nHume also emphasizes relations between unequals, such as in\nparents\u2019 love for their children, which he believed to be the\nstrongest bond the mind is capable of, and from which he builds his\nmoral theory. Gilligan presented data from female and male subjects\nshowing that by and large, females made decisions about moral dilemmas\nbased on concrete situations in which the parties know details about\neach other, emphasizing feelings such as care for others, and\npreserving relations, while males for the most part decided on the\nbasis of rule-following and justice while abstracting from the details\nof the case. This is not to say that Gilligan\u2019s claims are free\nfrom controversy; rather, since she published the results of her\nstudy, her claims have been criticized for perpetuating sexist\nstereotypes (Tronto 1993), for being inaccurate both because there are\nnot significant differences in the reasoning of males and females at\ndifferent life stages (Walker 1993), and because any differences in\nmoral reasoning have more to do with education or general cognitive\ndevelopment rather than gender (Greeno and Maccoby 1993), for being\nfalse because her sample size and characterizations are inadequate for\ndrawing the conclusions she does about gendered reasoning (Luria 1993)\nand for invoking generalizations that can be used to support racist\nviews (Moody-Adams 1991, 199). These objections aside, Baier argues\nthat Gilligan\u2019s data about females\u2019 moral reasoning is\naligned with Hume\u2019s theory, while data about males\u2019 moral\nreasoning is aligned with other justice-oriented theories such as\nKant\u2019s and Hobbes\u2019s. Baier endorses Hume\u2019s theory as\nmore amiable to feminism since it speaks more accurately to\nwomen\u2019s experiences than Kantian or other justice-oriented\ntheories, particularly women\u2019s experience of care-taking\nrelationships that require knowing the particularities of the persons\ninvolved.\n\nSince Gilligan\u2019s findings were published, some feminists have\ngone beyond endorsing Hume\u2019s theory by valorizing women\u2019s\ncaring in a new moral theory, the ethic of care, which is grounded at\nleast in part on acting from the motive of care (see the entry on\n feminist ethics).\n What makes the feminist complaint against traditional moral theories\ndifferent from that of philosophers such as Michael Stocker (1976),\nwho argues that modern moral theories are \u201cschizophrenic\u201d\nbecause they pay attention only to reasons, values, and justification\nwhile saying little if anything about motives, is that it is lodged\nfor the feminist reason that women\u2019s voice has been excluded\nfrom moral theory, and that care, specifically, is the motive left\nout. The motive of care is prominent in relations among family\nmembers, particularly of mother to child. Since traditional moral\ntheories are concerned primarily with mores that ought to govern\nrelations between strangers in the public sphere, they leave out\ndiscussion of caring that goes on in relations in the so-called\nprivate sphere among intimates, especially the mother-child relation.\nAnd since women historically have been relegated to the private\nsphere, much of the moral life as they experience it within the family\ngets left out. Feminists who endorse the ethic of care thus aim to\nvalorize care in moral theory, thereby giving women a moral voice\nequal to men\u2019s.\n\nMost care ethicists believe that the motive of care, not just\nacting in a caring way, is central to, and is a distinguishing feature\nof, the ethic of care (for example, Ruddick 1980; Noddings, 1984;\nBaier 1987b; Calhoun 1988; Held 1990), but at least one suggests that\ncaring does not require any particular emotion toward the one cared\nfor (Manning 1992, 64). Some feminists favor incorporating care into\njustice theories (Friedman 1987; Tronto 1993; Flanagan and Jackson\n1987; Blum 1988), though others suggest that we altogether replace\njustice theories with an ethic of care (Gilligan, 1982 and 1987;\nNoddings 1984; Ruddick 1980). Those in the latter group believe that\nmoral action is prompted by the motive of care rather than by reason\nitself.\n\nMargaret Little argues that the motive of care plays a significant\nrole in moral epistemology: it is essential for seeing the moral\nlandscape, that is, for knowing what is morally called for in a given\nsituation, and for getting us to moral truths (Little 2007). Little\nshares the same suspicion as the feminists cited above that care has\nbeen assigned a \u201clesser\u201d role than reason because of its\nhistorical association with women. Little argues that when we care\nabout a person, we have the right background disposition for morally\nrelevant features to come into our consciousness. Caring makes us\nreceptive to the particularities of a person, enables us to listen to\ntheir narrative, and makes us respect the person as a responsible\nsubject. Only when we are so disposed do we know what is morally\ncalled for\u2014caring about persons enables us to pick up on what is\nmorally salient (424\u201325). Those who have merely an intellectual\ncomprehension of the moral landscape but never respond appropriately\nhave a clouded perception, much like a person who uses the term\n\u201cgreen\u201d correctly but has never seen the color and so\nlacks the concept of \u201cgreen\u201d (427). Little argues that the\nmoral case is even worse than the color case because those who lack\nthe appropriate emotions will not get morality right. Such is the case\nwith the person who sees that certain things are painful and knows\nwhat pain is, yet does not see pain as evil. This person does not get\nmorality right because, first, nonmoral terms cannot completely\nexplain morality (e.g., they cannot explain the difference in the\ncruelty of kicking a dog, taunting someone verbally, and forgetting to\ninvite the neighbor\u2019s child to one\u2019s daughter\u2019s\nbirthday party) (428). A second reason is that whether a feature plays\na role in determining an act\u2019s moral status is dependent, in a\nway that cannot be codified, on other relevant features. For instance,\nan act\u2019s being fun may be a reason to do it, but it is also a\nfeature that makes hunting animals morally problematic (428). Little\nconcludes that affect, particularly care for persons, is a necessary\ncomponent of apprehending moral properties themselves, contrary to\ntraditional accounts, according to which moral knowledge is acquired\nstrictly by reason whose verdicts are passed on to motivation which in\nturn issues in the appropriate response (420, 428).\n\nAlthough the ethic of care is still in a fairly developmental stage,\ndefended more fully in a 2006 book by Virginia Held, it has been\ncriticized by some feminists as being merely a feminine, but\nnot a feminist, moral theory. A feminine ethic gives weight\nto the experiences and intuitions of women, but it need not aim at\nending women\u2019s oppression; a feminist ethic has as one of its\naims ending women\u2019s oppression. If care is a motive that women\nexperience mainly in connection with their being in a position of\nexploitation, then one worry is that valorizing it in moral theory\ndoes not overcome, but may even perpetuate, its role in women\u2019s\noppression. Sarah Hoagland, for instance, criticizes the ethic of care\nfor at least three reasons: that it is grounded in the unequal\nrelationship of a mother having natural care for her child which may\nnot, especially in a male child, ever be reciprocated; that it fails\nto acknowledge the real conflict that some mothers feel between\nresentment and tenderness; and that in appealing to the feminine which\nis itself a product of the masculine world, it risks perpetuating\nwomen\u2019s oppression (Hoagland 1991, 253, 254, and 256). Marilyn\nFriedman critiques the kind of care involved in the ethic of care.\nWhile men\u2019s caring, as revealed in earning a paycheck and\nproviding material goods for the family, has to do with protection and\nmaterial forms of help that men control, women\u2019s caring, as\nrevealed in emotional work, has to do with admitting dependency and\nsharing or losing control, which contributes to their own oppression\n(Friedman 1993, 175 and 177). Lawrence Blum, et.al., argue that\nwomen\u2019s caring reinforces the suppression of the self and leads\nto a denial of their autonomy, and makes mothers judge their success\nsolely in terms of the success of their children, making them lose\ntouch with their own needs (Blum, et.al. 1973\u201374, 231\u201332,\n235, and 239). Claudia Card argues that sometimes the caring that\nwomen engage in is not virtuous, but instead is misplaced gratitude to\nmen who either have the power to abuse them or offer women the\nprivilege of service in exchange for \u201cprotection\u201d (Card\n1993, 216). Women\u2019s caring is often a survival strategy, and so\nGilligan is wrong to think that women\u2019s reasoning can deepen and\ncorrect the ethics of the more privileged (207). Card believes that\ntoo often women do not discriminate good from bad relationships, and\nend up assuming responsibility for maintaining any relationships they\ncome to be involved in by trying to satisfy everyone because they are\nafraid to say \u201cno.\u201d Barbara Houston cautions that if care,\nlike anything else in ethics, is declared good or right or just, it\nhad better be so for women (Houston 1987, 261). While Houston agrees\nwith the feminist intention to reclaim womanly virtues as virtues in\nthe face of their absence from contemporary moral theory, she cautions\nthat these virtues, including care, should win the liberation of\nwomen, make women\u2019s subordination a primary moral concern, make\nit a recognizable moral problem rather than a nonmoral matter,\nchallenge the status quo of women\u2019s social position, and not\nfurther women\u2019s oppression (255).\n\nIn spite of the vast amount of attention feminists have paid to the\nethic of care, and perhaps in light of the worries about care and\nwomen\u2019s oppression, some feminists have turned their attention\naway from making the motive of care central in moral theory. Jean\nHampton tries to salvage Hobbesian moral theory, and believes that\nfeminists should make the motive of self-interest part of their moral\ntheory because without it women lose themselves in slavish action\n(1993). They become just like Amy, a girl that Gilligan describes in\none of her discussions of gendered moral reasoning. Hampton reads\nGilligan\u2019s much-discussed case of Amy and Jake in the following\nway. Amy reasons from the care perspective, seeing morality as being\nresponsive to others\u2019 needs, not hurting others, and being in\nservice to them. She loses herself in moral dilemmas, not being able\nfirmly to assert herself or let her interests count, but always places\nthe needs of others first. She borders on servility and lacks\nself-worth. Jake, on the other hand, a representative male moral\nreasoner, reasons from the justice perspective, seeing morality as a\nset of traffic rules that amount to pursuing one\u2019s own interests\nwithout interfering with the interests of others. Jake is insensitive\nto the needs of others, and sees the world from his own self-centered\nviewpoint, believing that one\u2019s own self ought to come first in\nmoral dilemmas. Hampton argues that neither is the ideal moral view,\nbut that Amy suffers more because she is highly exploitable. Hampton\nfavors a contractarian morality over the ethic of care, since on the\nformer a person is prompted by self-interest in putting forward claims\nwith other potential contractors to the hypothetical bargain from\nwhich morality is ultimately derived. A Hobbesian hypothetical\nbargainer will not make or keep contracts that do not provide an\nexpectation of self-benefit. Hampton argues that self-interest, not\ncare, is the motive women should have if they are to avoid being\nexploited, since self-interest ensures that a person insists on her\nown worth in bargaining schemes and relations with others. To address\nother feminists\u2019s worries about contractarianism excluding from\nbargains those from whom others do not expect to benefit in\ninteractions, including typically the disenfranchised, Hampton\nmodifies contractarianism by building in the Kantian assumption that\nall persons have intrinsic value and thus must have their interests\nrespected.\n\nOne important issue relating to moral motivation that feminists have\nsaid only a bit about is the internalism/externalism debate (see the\nentry on\n moral motivation).\n Generally stated, internalism is the view that there is a logical or\nnecessary connection between two concepts, typically reasons, motives,\nand obligations. According to one version of internalism, which David\nBrink calls \u201cagent internalism,\u201d in virtue of the concept\nof morality, moral obligations (or moral reasons, on a two-step\ninternalism linking obligations, reasons, and motives) necessarily\nmotivate the agent to act morally (see Brink 1986, 28). The\nagent\u2019s having a reason to act morally, whether or not the agent\nrecognizes it, entails having a motive to act morally. Externalism is\nthe denial of the necessity condition. According to another version of\ninternalism, if an agent judges that it is right for her to \u03c6 in\ncircumstances C, then either she is motivated to \u03c6, or she is\nirrational (Smith, 1994, 61; Korsgaard 1996). Motivation is\nnecessarily present in the rational agent who recognizes a reason to\nact morally; having a reason to act morally entails having a\nmotivation, at least in the rational agent. The corresponding\nexternalist view is that judging that an act is right either need not\nmotivate the rational agent (weak externalism) or does not motivate\nthe rational agent (strong externalism).\n\nTwo issues relating to the internalism/externalism debate bear on\nwomen\u2019s oppression. First, on agent internalism, if the agent\nlacks the relevant motivation, the agent does not have a reason to act\nmorally (see Brink 1986, 29). Then for agents who lack a motivation to\nact in ways preventing women\u2019s oppression, they lack a reason to\ndo so. This means that oppressors who lack the relevant motivation do\nnot act against reason when they act in ways contributing to\nwomen\u2019s oppression. Second, on the other version of internalism\ndescribed above, if the agent fails to be motivated by a moral reason,\nthe agent still has the reason but is irrational (Smith 1994;\nKorsgaard 1996). Then agents who recognize that they have a reason to\nbe self-respecting, for instance, but who fail to be so, are\nirrational. This runs the risk of impugning the rationality of\noppressed persons who fail to see their intrinsic worth as persons due\nto their social circumstances.\n\nAlthough feminists have not addressed the problems for feminism\nrelated to agent internalism, at least two feminists have identified\nproblems with internalism in general, as a logical thesis about the\nconnection between motives and reasons and/or obligations. Peggy\nDesAutels explores the phenomenon of having a moral commitment to the\nethic of care yet failing to follow through on it even when the agent\nis competent and does not ignore her moral commitments (2004).\nDesAutels approaches the issue of internalism from an empirical rather\nthan a conceptual point of view, which sets apart her approach from\nthat of standard internalists. She takes herself to be following\nfeminist theorists such as Carol Gilligan and Margaret Urban Walker in\nexamining moral issues, including that of the internalism/externalism\ndebate, as they present themselves in richly detailed concrete\nsituations, which, she believes, makes her account feminist (71).\nDesAutels argues that moral attentiveness requires \u201cnonpassive\nvigilance of thought where we attempt to counter known psychological\ntendencies and subtle social influences that prevent us from seeing\nand responding to the demands of care\u201d (72). Two interferences\nwith the demands of care are moral oblivion, or, being completely or\nmostly unaware of a moral demand, and being unresponsive to moral\nsituations. DesAutels urges that we attempt to improve both our own\npsychologies and the social contexts in which they are embedded by,\nfor instance, becoming more receptive to the subtle ways in which\nsexism occurs. She is suggesting that, contra internalism, it is\npossible to make a moral judgment yet fail to be appropriately\nmotivated, due to sexist influences; sexism can make us unaware of a\nmoral demand or unresponsive to it. Attention to the impact of sexism\nand other forms of oppression that are revealed in concrete situations\nis a lens that reveals a limitation of internalism as a purely\nconceptual issue about what it means to have a moral reason.\n\nJames Lindemann Nelson argues that internalists who endorse a\nnecessary connection between moral judgment and motivation fail to\ncapture the idea that the agent\u2019s judgment might come in degrees\nof confidence in the correctness of her judgment or the exigency of\nthe values involved (2004, 84). Nelson argues that the\nbelief-motivation relationship is more complex in the real world than\ninternalists admit. He takes internalism and externalism to be points\non a scale registering the relationship between an agent and the moral\nunderstandings considered authoritative in her moral-social world.\nThus contra internalism, it is not the case that if the agent acts\nimmorally, she simply must not have believed the relevant moral\njudgment. Rather, the connection between moral belief and action\nshould be sensitive to the highly variegated character of the\nmoral-social world and the different locations within it that real\npeople inhabit (89). Nelson rejects the standard view of internalism\nas a logical connection between belief and motivation, in favor of the\nview that internalism reflects the degrees to which a person grasps\nmoral beliefs and to which she acts on these beliefs. So if one lacks\na strong sense of what one ought to do, this need not mean that one\ncompletely lacks an authentic belief about what one ought to do.\nNelson understands his account to be feminist because it critiques the\nforms of social life. That is, it is sensitive to the fact that a\nperson\u2019s own moral beliefs and reasons may not be consistent\nwith the moral beliefs and reasons held widely in her society,\nespecially when it is a sexist one. A person might truly believe that\nher society takes something to be morally required, but not be fully\nmotivated by her society\u2019s moral requirements because they\ndictate sexist behavior. Nelson\u2019s account allows a person to\nrefuse to fully embrace motivating reasons that are endorsed by her\nsociety, and still have moral authority.\n\nFeminists might also question whether the internalist is correct in\nthinking that if an otherwise rational person fails to be motivated by\nher moral judgment, then she is irrational. Consider an example that I\nwill return to in Section 2, Thomas Hill\u2019s well-known case of\nthe Deferential Wife, who is utterly devoted to her husband, buying\nclothes he prefers, having sex when he is in the mood, and moving\nwhere he wants. She tends not to form her own interests, values, and\nideals, and counts them as less important than her husband\u2019s\nwhen she does. She believes that women are mentally and physically\nequal, if not superior to men, but that it is women\u2019s proper\nrole to serve their husbands. She does not believe that her rights are\nbeing trampled on because she is glad and proud to serve her husband.\nShe is confused about her worth as a person, and is servile, or,\nlacking in self-respect, despite being glad and proud to serve her\nhusband (Hill 1973). A legitimate explanation for the Deferential\nWife\u2019s confusion about her worth is her socialization in a\npatriarchal society which sends her many messages of inferiority. Her\nconfusion about her worth prevents her from being motivated by a\nreason to be self-respecting. An internalist might impugn her\nrationality: if she truly recognizes that she has a reason to be\nself-respecting, yet remains unmoved, she must be irrational. But the\ninternalist\u2019s judgment that she is irrational seems at odd with\nfeminist aims, since it fails to acknowledge the role that\nsocialization plays in whether she is motivated by the reasons she\nhas. It places the blame for failing to be motivated by a reason\nsquarely on the victim of such circumstances and her rational\ncapacities, when it may be the case that the Deferential Wife reasons\ncorrectly, understands what it means to have intrinsic worth, sees\nthat if a person had intrinsic worth she would respect herself, but\ngets the facts wrong about her own worth due to her experiences. The\nfeminist objection is that a person\u2019s social circumstances are a\nbetter explanation of the disconnection between reasons and\nmotivations than a failure of rationality (Superson 2010).\n2. Deformed Desires\n\nOne kind of motivation that has received and continues to receive a\nfair bit of attention from feminists is what they call \u201cdeformed\ndesires,\u201d \u201cadaptive preferences,\u201d or\n\u201crepressive satisfactions.\u201d Deformed desires are\nsignificant for issues such as autonomy, agency, and responsibility\n(see Section 3).\n\nJohn Stuart Mill was perhaps the first philosopher to acknowledge the\nconcept of desires deformed by patriarchy, but Sandra Bartky was one\nof the first philosophers to name them (Mill 1861; Bartky 1990a).\nBartky describes repressive satisfactions as those that \u201cfasten\nus to the established order of domination, for the same system which\nproduces false needs also controls the conditions under which such\nneeds can be satisfied\u201d (Bartky 1990a, 42). Mill, Bartky, and\nMartha Nussbaum attribute the cause of such \u201cfalse needs\u201d\nto various factors, including unequal education, indoctrination to\nbelieve that women are fit mainly for domesticity and other\nnonintellectual pursuits, psychological manipulation, women\u2019s\nfear of moving into new positions that remain unequal and unprotected,\ndenial of autonomy, lack of information or false information about\nfact, lack of reflection or deliberation about norms, and lack of\noptions (Bartky 1990a, 42; Nussbaum 1999a, 149). Jon Elster describes\nhow a person acquires deformed desires, which is that she adapts her\npreferences according to her opportunities and without her control or\nawareness. Elster dubs this kind of adaptation the \u201csour\ngrapes\u201d phenomenon, according to which the fox\u2019s\nconviction that he is prevented from eating grapes that are out of his\nreach causes him to believe that grapes are sour and so to prefer not\nto eat them. Let\u2019s apply this phenomenon to the case of women\nunder patriarchy. The Deferential Wife (described in Section 1) who\nlives in a world in which women are routinely denied educational\nopportunities and access to the best jobs, and so become economically\ndependent on men, is more likely to desire to be servile to her\nhusband and children. A female student who lives in a patriarchal\nculture that teaches women to look to men for protection, security,\nand strength rather than to cultivate these traits in themselves, is\nmore likely to want to date males in power, such as her professor,\nbecause she sees them as exhibiting these traits. One of\nBartky\u2019s examples is that of female narcissism, or an\ninfatuation with the female body, which occurs when women seem\nenthusiastically to embrace unachievable, alienating, sexist standards\nof femininity that are informed by what Bartky calls \u201cthe\nfashion-beauty complex.\u201d Women living in a patriarchal culture\nin which they are judged and objectified according to these standards\nare likely to adopt the standards and prefer to fulfill them.\n\nSeveral features distinguish deformed desires from nondeformed\ndesires. One is that even though most if not all of our desires are\nformed in a social context, deformed desires are formed in response to\nunjust social conditions such as those found in a patriarchal\nsociety in which men are deemed superior to women. A second feature is\nthat satisfaction of deformed desires benefits not the subject who has\nthem as in the typical case of desire-satisfaction, but, according to\nBartky, a social order whose interest lies in domination. For example,\na woman\u2019s desire to conform to the \u201cfashion-beauty\ncomplex,\u201d when satisfied, leaves her with an inferior body\nimage, and demands her time and money which in turn stands in the way\nof her pursuit of her career goals, while men gain economically. A\nfemale student\u2019s desire to date her professor, when satisfied in\nthe typical case, reinforces the stereotypes that women need to be\nwith a (powerful) man for self-validation and that they are not\nintellectual. Men benefit when they, but not women, are taken\nseriously in the pursuit of their careers. One question feminists such\nas Bartky have raised is whether women actually do benefit from\nsatisfying their deformed desires (Bartky 1982; 1990a, 36). While it\nis not implausible to think that women do achieve some benefits (e.g.,\nnarcissistic pleasures from conformity to the fashion-beauty complex,\ngetting dates with men), feminists typically acknowledge that these\nbenefits are often merely short-run: conformists to beauty standards\nrisk self-hatred when they inevitably fall short, and conformists to\ndating standards requiring female passivity and submission often end\nup in autonomy-denying relationships with men. Some feminists argue\nthat conformity to patriarchal standards perpetuates women\u2019s\noppression by perpetuating stereotypes about them, which harms, rather\nthan benefits, all women (e.g., Cudd 1988). Thus feminists admit that\nwhile women in some ways benefit from deformed-desire satisfaction,\nthey are wrong about the harms involved and the \u201creal\u201d\nbenefits of conformity, which are enjoyed by men. In fact, Bartky\nsuggests that it is not merely error that is involved, but deception,\nsince \u201cfalse needs\u201d or deformed desires are\n\u201cproduced through indoctrination, psychological manipulation,\nand the denial of autonomy\u201d (Bartky 1990a, 42). A third feature\nof deformed desires, then, is that typically they involve deception\nabout what their bearer truly wants, or even what is truly in the\nbearer\u2019s own interest or will promote her welfare.\n\nOne significant issue relating to deformed desires is autonomy, which\nis commonly defined as self-determination or self-direction. On the\nface of it, an agent\u2019s satisfying her deformed desires seems to\nstand in the way of promoting her autonomy, for if the satisfaction of\ndeformed desires in reality benefits the system of domination and the\nprivileged persons in it, then satisfying deformed desires does not\nseem to be an indication of the agent\u2019s\nself-determination, but rather the agent\u2019s\nsubordination to the system and its ends. Another way that deformed\ndesires are suspect for reasons relating to autonomy is that they are\nunchosen, the result of adaptation to one\u2019s opportunities and\nwithout one\u2019s awareness or control, as Elster\u2019s\n\u201csour grapes\u201d phenomenon describes. Moreover, the more\ndeformed desires an agent has in her total desire set, the greater the\nlikelihood that she will be under their sway, since they will not be\ncounteracted by nondeformed desires. And the more likely the agent is\nunder the sway of her deformed desires, the less likely she will be\nself-determining. The issue bears on women\u2019s oppression because\nif the agent acts mostly from her deformed desires, she is likely to\ncontribute to her own oppression.\n\nThere are differing views on whether women have deformed desires, to\nwhat extent they do, and what their effect is on the agent\u2019s\nautonomy. On the one extreme, some philosophers deny that women even\nhave deformed desires, so obviously such desires can have no hold on\nwomen or interfere with their autonomy. Christina Hoff Sommers\nbelieves that since women\u2019s preferences are no longer the\nproduct of undemocratic indoctrination and are now taken into account\nby women\u2019s having the right to vote, they are therefore\nauthentic and it would be patronizing and illiberal to criticize\nwomen\u2019s preferences (1994, 259\u2013260). Many evolutionary\npsychologists agree with Sommers that women\u2019s preferences are\nauthentic rather than adaptive ones formed in response to limited\noptions. According to Catherine Wilson, these evolutionary\npsychologists believe further that we live in a just world where\nwomen\u2019s preferences match what they receive and that the\ndistribution of the components of well-being is also just\u2014women\nget what they really want (2004, 101\u2013102). So what explains why\nwomen tend not to prefer new experiences, competition, accumulation,\nand social rewards to the same extent as men? According to Wilson,\nmany evolutionary psychologists attribute women\u2019s and\nmen\u2019s different traits, values, preferences, and interests not\nto discrimination against women, but to differential parental\ninvestment (105). What this means, for these evolutionary\npsychologists, is that females invest more than males in nurturing\ntheir offspring since it is more costly for a female than a male to\nreplace a child. This phenomenon goes hand-in-hand with a greater\ncompetition among males over mating opportunities, since mating with\nmany partners increases the likelihood of having more offspring.\nWilson attributes these ideas to the evolutionary\npsychologists\u2019s belief that we are all playing a game that is\nwon by an individual\u2019s having more viable offspring than others\nof her or his sex (105). This sets up a \u201cwinning human female\nstrategy,\u201d evidenced by thousands of years of evolution, that\nconsists of the following norms: finding the fittest male to be\none\u2019s mate, withholding sex to get commitment, and exchanging\nfidelity and domestic service for lifelong sustenance (106). These\nfemale norms, in turn, according to the evolutionary psychologists at\nissue, reflect female preferences. Women\u2019s lower status is\nexplained, then, not by discrimination, but by their authentic\npreferences. Since women prefer to nurture children, be faithful to\ntheir mate, and avoid making their mate jealous, they do not adopt\nmale norms and preferences associated with success in the world.\n\nMany feminists reject the notion that women have no deformed desires\nbut have only authentic preferences. Martha Nussbaum responds to\nSommers by citing plenty of examples of deformed desires in women, and\nnotes that even conservative economists like Gary Becker, as well as\nphilosophers from Plato to Aquinas to Kant, acknowledge their\nexistence (1999a, 152). Catherine Wilson directly takes on the\nevolutionary psychologists she discusses who reject the notion of\nwomen\u2019s having adaptive preferences. In order to evaluate the\nclaims made by evolutionary psychologists about women\u2019s\npreferences, Wilson believes that we can rely on sources such as our\ndirect personal and social experiences, mediated social experiences\nsuch as impressions from novels, films, and the media, and various\npsychological and sociological data. She chooses to rely on novels,\nwhich, she admits, are somewhat unreliable but nevertheless reflect\nboth the stories of \u201ceverywoman\u201d and certain features of\nthe social world, since they are constrained by plausibility\nconsiderations (110). The novels describe women who initially follow\nthe standard theory of evolutionary psychology to find a wealthy mate\nwhen they are young and have the greatest bargaining power, but\nthrough their characters suggest that what women really want in a mate\nis \u201cyouth, good looks, manners, intelligence, a gentle demeanor,\nand attentiveness\u201d (110). The novels suggest that those whose\nopportunities to achieve wealth and power are restricted end up not\nfully using their intellect and emotions, and that they would not make\nthe choices they make under better conditions, as Elster\u2019s\n\u201csour grapes\u201d phenomenon predicts. Wilson concludes that\nthe view that women have deformed desires is a more plausible\nhypothesis than the view that women have different preferences from\nmen and get what they really value.\n\nBut the debate goes on amongst philosophers. Harriet Baber comes close\nto suggesting that women do not have deformed desires or adaptive\npreferences (Baber 2007). Baber argues against Nussbaum\u2019s view\nthat disadvantaged women who have adaptive preferences might get what\nthey want when they satisfy these preferences, but they are not better\noff because their desires are deformed. In contrast, Baber believes\nthat adaptation is irrelevant to whether preference-satisfaction\ncontributes to one\u2019s welfare: if I want something, getting it is\ngood for me regardless of how I acquired that desire (110).\nBaber\u2019s explanation for the choices that deprived women make is\nthat they are making the best of a bad situation, choosing not\nnecessarily what they would prefer all things considered, but rather\nwhat they would prefer given their options. While Nussbaum believes\nthat Jayamma, who settles for a low-paying job with poor working\nconditions because she believes this to be her lot in life, lacks a\nconception of herself as a person with rights that can be violated and\na belief that she is wronged, Baber believes that she has just settled\nfor second best, since she would grab a raise if it were offered to\nher (Nussbaum 2000, 113; Baber 111). Similarly, Nussbaum believes that\nVasanti, who stays in an abusive marriage for years, does not see\nherself as having rights that are violated, but has a deformed\npreference to put up with abuse as part of women\u2019s lot, while\nBaber denies that Vasanti has such a preference, suggesting instead\nthat she prefers a bundle that includes putting up with abuse along\nwith having a home and basic necessities (Nussbaum 2000, 68\u201369;\nBaber 113\u2013114). Baber argues further that when women do, in\nfact, acquire adaptive preferences, as is the case with Srey Mom, once\nsold into slavery, who now at least partly wants to remain a\nprostitute when given the chance to go into the community where she\nwill be ostracized, we beg the question if we assume that their\nchoices are uninformed or cooly calculated (121). Baber\u2019s view\nin the end is that it is an empirical question whether the women in\nthe cases described are rational self-interested choosers who make the\nbest of a bad situation, or whether they are damaged by deformed\npreferences. She maintains that they, as well as most members of\ntraditionally disadvantaged groups who succumb to bad treatment, are\nrational self-choosers (122).\n\nWhile most feminists agree that women have deformed desires, they\ndiffer in their views about whether, and to what extent, deformed\ndesires interfere with their bearer\u2019s autonomy. Arguably more\nradical feminists, such as Mary Daly, Andrea Dworkin, and Catharine\nMacKinnon sometimes speak as if all of women\u2019s desires are\ndeformed, and that women\u2019s autonomy is entirely compromised as a\nresult (Daly 1978; Dworkin 1987; MacKinnon 1987b and 1987c). One\nexplanation for why deformed desires take such a hold on women might\nbe the fact that they are tied integrally to an agent\u2019s\nidentity. Sandra Bartky argues that the norms of femininity, for\ninstance, are imposed on women during the construction of their\nsubjectivities rather than when they are fully formed subjects, and\nthat a woman\u2019s conforming to these norms is essential to her\nsense of herself as a sexually desiring and desirable subject such\nthat expecting her not to conform threatens her with at least\ndesexualization (2002, 25). This explanation aside, in other places,\nthese same radical feminists cited above join other feminists in\nsuggesting that only some of women\u2019s desires are deformed, and\nthat women are not entirely under the sway of their deformed desires\nsince these desires can be outweighed by competing desires women have\nfor their own welfare. MacKinnon, for one, suggests that victims of\nsexual harassment find harassment to be devastating to their\nself-respect and health and do not enjoy their harasser\u2019s\nattention, rape victims who appear disinterested are in reality\nsilenced and do not have a desire to be raped, and pornography models\noperate not from free will and a desire to display their bodies in\npornographic poses, but from constraint and inequality (1987a, 54;\n1987d, 114; 1987d, 180 and 194). Writing about date rape, Lois Pineau\nsuggests that women know which sexual encounters are enjoyable, and\nthus consensual, even though they play out patriarchal roles of\ncoyness and submission and men interpret their desires along these\nlines. Although women appear to want to be dominated by men in sex,\nwhat they really find enjoyable is communicative sex where the\npartners seek to know and respect each other\u2019s desires just like\nparticipants in a good conversation (1989, 239). Deep down, Pineau and\nMacKinnon are arguing, women really know what they want and what is\ngood for them despite patriarchy\u2019s influence on them and their\ndesires; they have competing nondeformed desires for their own\nwelfare. Many other feminists seem to be assuming this kind of\nposition when they object to patriarchal practices, since these\npractices are at odds, they believe, with what women want. On this\nview, then, women have deformed desires, but these desires do not have\nsuch a strong hold on their bearer that they cannot be overridden by\nother desires the bearer has for her own welfare. This view holds out\npromise that women can exhibit at least some degree of autonomy in\nfollowing their nondeformed desires, and thus be motivated to act in\nways that do not contribute to their own oppression.\n\nIndeed, Uma Narayan explicitly acknowledges that women under\npatriarchy have both deformed desires and nondeformed desires, and\nbelieves that women can be fully autonomous because they\n\u201cbargain\u201d with patriarchy in the context of both the\nexternal constraints it imposes on women and the internal constraints\nit imposes in the form of deformed desires (2002). Narayan contrasts\nthe \u201cbargainers with patriarchy\u201d with both the\n\u201cdupes of patriarchy,\u201d who completely subscribe to\npatriarchal norms and practices of their culture and impose them on\nthemselves, having none but deformed desires, and the \u201cprisoners\nof patriarchy,\u201d who are constrained against their will and\nconsent by external forces imposed by their culture (418, 422). The\nbargainers with patriarchy, then, face the external constraints of\npatriarchy, and have both deformed and nondeformed desires. Narayan\ntakes as her case study Sufi Pirzada Muslim women who are expected to\nwear a burqua, or, \u201cto veil\u201d (she uses the term\n\u201cveiling\u201d to include burqua-wearing), arguing that they\nare bargainers with patriarchy who in the face of external and\ninternal constraints do what they believe is best for themselves. On\nthis point, her view is similar to Baber\u2019s, though Narayan is\nless dismissive of the reality of deformed desires than is Baber.\nContrary to the popular Western opinion that these women veil because\nthey are duped into patriarchal norms associated with veiling, Narayan\nargues that the situation is more complex, because veiling women\nacknowledge that the burqua is uncomfortable and makes them injury\nprone, worry about their reputation with their families and\ncommunities if they do not veil, and are aware of the economic and\npolitical implications of not veiling. Narayan analogizes their\nsituation to that of Western women who do not want to be seen in\npublic without makeup\u2014both are bargainers with, rather than\ndupes of, patriarchy. Narayan defines autonomy quite liberally, as the\nview that a person is autonomous as long as she is a \u201cnormal\nadult\u201d with no serious cognitive or emotional impairments and is\nnot subject to literal or outright coercion from others (429). Under\nthis definition, the presence of deformed desires does not threaten\ntheir bearer\u2019s autonomy, even if she is partly under their sway,\nso long as they do not seriously impair her. Narayan believes that\nbargainers with patriarchy, such as veiling women, are autonomous\nbecause, despite their choices being constrained by patriarchy, they\ncan make genuine, reflective choices within these constraints. And\neven though their critical abilities, which seem to be at the heart of\nautonomy, can be distorted by patriarchy, sometimes the starkness of\npatriarchal constraints has the opposite effect, causing a person to\nface head on the conflict in her desires and to choose to act in ways\nthat are at odds with patriarchy.\n\nAnother account that challenges the position that adaptive preferences\nautomatically undercut autonomy is defended by Donald Bruckner (2007).\nBruckner objects to Elster\u2019s view of the \u201csour\ngrapes\u201d phenomenon that the fox\u2019s preference change is\nirrational because it is not autonomous, occurring merely through a\ncausal mechanism irrelevant to rationality (307). Bruckner argues that\nboth adaptive preference change and adaptive preference formation are\noften rational. Adaptive preferences are like other preferences in\nthat they guide a person\u2019s deliberation and give her reasons for\naction (311). Bruckner gives the example of Veronica, who initially\nprefers to become an Olympic competitor in tennis, but after years of\npractice realizes that even though she is very talented at tennis, she\nwill not achieve Olympic status, and so downgrades her aspirations and\ncomes to prefer to be a local star, a change in preference that might\noccur behind her back and thus be non-autonomous (313). Bruckner\nbelieves that she should adapt her preferences thusly, as doing so\nwould better promote her own subjective well-being. He argues that\nthere should be a presumption in favor of the normativity of any of\nour preferences, even ones caused by factors out of our control, since\nany of an agent\u2019s preferences are still her own and thus give\nher a reason to act (316). The real test, then, for deformed desires,\nones formed in response to unjust social conditions, is whether they\nare truly the agent\u2019s own, and so autonomously held. On\nBruckner\u2019s account, the agent\u2019s not endorsing her new\npreference upon reflection makes her new preference not fully her own,\nand so irrational. Thus while one condition for the rationality of an\nadaptive preference for Elster is that it be autonomously acquired,\nfor Bruckner, it is that the preference be autonomously retained\n(319). If the agent reflectively endorses her adaptive preference in a\nway that is responsive to her feasible set, and not simply her false\nbeliefs about her feasible set, even though she limits her potential\nand lowers her sights, it is rational for her to retain this\npreference (319\u2013320). Bruckner agrees with Nussbaum that certain\nmoral and political conditions interfere with an agent\u2019s\nrepudiation of her limited desires, and urges that the agent\u2019s\nadaptive preferences count as her own, that is, as autonomous, only if\ncertain moral conditions are met, such as those proposed by\nNussbaum\u2019s capabilities approach that defends the provision of\ncertain capabilities, liberties, and opportunities to all citizens\n(322\u2013323). Nussbaum\u2019s capabilities approach, unlike\nBruckner\u2019s view, invokes an objective notion of the good.\n\nBruckner\u2019s account of reflective endorsement foreshadows Andrea\nWestlund\u2019s procedural autonomy account, one consistent with a\nsubjective notion of the good (Westlund 2003). Westlund takes up the\ncase of the Deferential Wife (discussed in Section 1 and earlier in\nthis section), who tends not to form her own interests, but when she\ndoes, counts them as less important than her husband\u2019s\npreferences. Westlund\u2019s account is \u201cdialogical,\u201d\naccording to which an autonomous agent has an attitude of\nresponsibility for her self and her commitments, and is prepared to\nengage in a dialogue with herself and (even hypothetical) others who\nhave different, critical perspectives, in order to offer justifying\nreasons for her desires. Westlund argues that the Deferential Wife\nfails this test of autonomy because she fails to give good reasons why\nshe ranks her husband\u2019s preferences higher than her own. But\nanother character, the extreme anti-feminist, who is also deferential,\ncounts as autonomous because she gives proper uptake to queries about\nher deference, even though we might disagree with her reasons for\nbeing so (e.g., the Bible tells her to be subservient to her husband).\nThe procedure of exhibiting genuine dialogical responsiveness rather\nthan offering pat answers or remaining tightly gripped by one\u2019s\ncommitments, and not the content of her desires, determines her\nautonomy.\n\nIn an attempt to bridge the gaps between subjective and objective\ngood, between seeing women with adaptive preferences as full agents\nand as victims, and between respecting women\u2019s autonomous\nchoices and promoting their flourishing, Serene Khader defends a\nperfectionist definition of adaptive preferences (Khader 2011).\nKhader\u2019s definition invokes objective value in the form of basic\nflourishing that is defined by some actual (not hypothetical)\ncross-cultural deliberative process. She defines adaptive preferences\nas those that are inconsistent with basic flourishing, are formed\nunder conditions nonconducive to basic flourishing, and that we\nbelieve people might be persuaded to transform when they scrutinize\nthem and are exposed to conditions more conducive to flourishing (42).\nThis definition is both procedural and substantive, because it\nidentifies preferences as adaptive according to the conditions under\nwhich they are formed, as well as the content of the preferences\nthemselves. The underlying premise is the \u201cFlourishing\nClaim\u201d that when people have options for flourishing, they tend\nto choose in ways that promote their flourishing (51). By\n\u201cflourishing,\u201d Khader means \u201cbasic\nflourishing,\u201d or flourishing at a minimal level rather than\nexcellence, since the object is to get cross-cultural agreement.\nBeyond this, she keeps the concept vague, intending for it to include\nthings like adequate nutrition (62\u201363). Khader also wants to\nseparate \u201cinappropriately adaptive preferences,\u201d which are\nharmful to their bearers and adapted to bad social conditions, from\nmerely adaptive preferences, which may not have these features\n(52\u201353). She cautions that we cannot read off preferences from\nbehavior, because, in agreement with Narayan and Baber, she believes\nthat women might simply be making the best of available options.\n\nUnlike feminists who locate the main problem with adaptive preferences\nas lying with their obstruction of the agent\u2019s autonomy, Khader\nrejects the view of adaptive preferences as autonomy deficits. She\nagrees that adaptive preferences can block the well-being of those who\nhave them, but she argues that both procedural and substantive\nautonomy accounts either yield results that do not square with our\nintuitions, or commit us to invoking policies that are coercive and so\nanti-liberal. The general charge against procedural autonomy accounts\nis that they inevitably sneak in an objective notion of the good when\nthey are supposed to be neutral, and that those who fail them are\nbelieved to lack mental capacities to understand or scrutinize their\nchoices. The general charge against substantive autonomy accounts is\nthat they inevitably involve disrespect for cultural diversity, with\nthe result that those who fail them are deemed to have bad values that\nrender inoperative their capacities to scrutinize their preferences\n(105). Either way, autonomy accounts have it that those with adaptive\npreferences are unable to make their own decisions, which is false and\ncondescending (103, 105).\n\nAside from their connection to autonomy, deformed desires can harm\ntheir bearer by functioning as one factor, possibly the most damaging\none, in psychological oppression. In general, psychological\noppression, as Sandra Bartky defines it, is to be weighed down in\none\u2019s mind, to have a harsh dominion exercised over one\u2019s\nself-esteem, or \u201cto internalize intimations of\ninferiority\u201d (Bartky 1990b, 22). Psychological oppression\ncontributes to a group\u2019s oppression in various ways. It can hide\nthe badness of oppressors and the beneficiaries of oppression by\nmaking them and their actions appear legitimate and by allowing them\nto carry on without overt acts of violence that they would otherwise\nuse to maintain a group\u2019s oppression (Bartky 1990b, 23).\nPsychological oppression contributes to a group\u2019s oppression\nalso by molding the oppressed and co-opting them so that their choices\nand decisions harm them while benefiting the privileged, thereby\nsustaining the system of oppression. Women\u2019s coming to prefer\nthe kinds of social roles that tend to subordinate them will make them\nless able to choose or give them fewer choices to make (Cudd 2006,\n157, 181).\n\nIn addition to the role deformed desires play in psychological\noppression, acting on some deformed desires can compromise the\nbearer\u2019s moral agency. Consider again the case of the\nDeferential Wife described above: her deformed desire is that she\nwants to be servile to her husband and children. A debate surfaced in\nthe philosophical literature about how to explain the wrongness of the\nDeferential Wife\u2019s servility, and each explanation revealed that\nservility was problematic for moral agency. Thomas Hill attributes the\nproblem to confusion about her rights\u2014how they can be waived and\nwhen they can be forfeited\u2014with the result that the Deferential\nWife fails to acknowledge her own moral status and to see her rightful\nplace in the moral community (1973). Marilyn Friedman attributes the\nproblem to the Deferential Wife\u2019s uncritically deferring to her\nhusband\u2019s preferences by failing to assess them in accord with\nher own principles, merely satisfying his wishes and whims taken as\ngiven, and becoming an accomplice to his goal-seeking behavior. Her\nlack of effective moral judgment makes her less than a whole person\nwho exhibits moral integrity (1985, 146\u2013147). Marcia Baron\nattributes the problem to the Deferential Wife\u2019s lacking a\ncritical examination of her reasons for deferring to her\nhusband\u2019s preferences (1985, 398). Each of these explanations is\ncommitted to the thought that acting on a desire to be servile can\ncompromise moral agency. This, too, is significant for oppression,\nsince those whose moral agency is compromised in these ways are easily\nexploitable (see Hampton, 1993).\n\nFeminists have identified other harmful modes of psychological\noppression aside from deformed desires. Stereotyping delivers messages\nof inferiority that the stereotyped can come to believe about\nthemselves and then live up to. Stereotyping contributes to\npsychological oppression by threatening a person\u2019s\nself-determination (Bartky 1990b, 23\u201324). Philosophers and\nothers have recently identified the phenomenon of \u201cstereotype\nthreat,\u201d which is the idea that members of subordinate groups to\nwhom stereotypes are applied, when made aware of the stereotypes prior\nto performing a task such as taking a test, underperform on that task\nbecause they are preoccupied by fears of confirming those stereotypes\n(Saul 2013, 41). Cultural domination, or being forced to see things\nfrom the perspective of a socially dominant group, cultivates feelings\nof incapability and denies the values and experiences of the oppressed\n(Bartky 1990B, 25). Sexual objectification psychologically oppresses\nwomen because it splits a woman into two parts, identifying her as a\nmere bodily part or function, thereby inferiorizing her (Bartky 1990b,\n26). Terror, brought about from violence and the threat of violence,\ninhibits coping strategies in everyday living, contributes to\npsychoses and neuroses, lessens trust in others, and makes victims\nwithdraw and become less likely to strike back (Cudd 2006,\n159\u2013160). False consciousness, which is the set of false beliefs\nformed under and supportive of oppression, such as the belief that a\nwoman\u2019s place is in the home, maintains harmful stereotypes and\nthereby perpetuates oppression (Cudd 2006, 178\u2013179). Members of\noppressed groups often experience feelings of humiliation,\ndegradation, shame, and low self-esteem in response to stereotyping,\nunequal treatment, harassment, and social distancing. These feelings\ndiminish confidence and reinforce stereotypes of weakness,\nvulnerability, and inferiority (Cudd 2006, 163\u2013165).\nPhilosophers such as Samantha Brennan have recently identified another\ncontributor to psychological oppression, that of microinequities\n(Brennan 2013). Brennan defines microinequities as small, unjust or\nundeserved inequalities that fall short of full-blown inequities only\non the basis of their size (184). They are ways in which persons, due\nto features such as gender and race, are singled out, or overlooked,\nignored, or otherwise discounted (184, citing Sandler 1986, 3). They\nare covert, often unintentional, unrecognized by the one who commits\nthem, and hard to prove (Brennan 184, citing Rowe 2008, 45).\nMicroinequities have a cumulative negative effect: they affect your\nself-value and self-esteem directly as well as indirectly, when few\nmembers of the group make it to the top because of the microinequities\nthemselves (1880. Thus, feminists have shown that not only deformed\ndesires, but these and other similar factors operate through\nwomen\u2019s own psychology to help sustain their own oppression.\n3. Responsibility\n3.1 Responsibility of Oppressors for Oppression\n\nResponsibility for a group\u2019s oppression seems to be distinct\nfrom responsibility for other immoral acts that individuals perform.\nOne reason is that oppression is a difficult concept for many to\ngrasp, partly because it can take subtle forms, partly because it is\nin many ways \u201cnormalized\u201d such that participants and even\nvictims become oblivious to it, and partly because it is\ninstitutionalized and part of the very structure of society, which\nmeans that often it is carried out independently of anyone\u2019s\nharboring any bad attitudes toward persons in subordinate groups (see\nMaybee 2002, for a clear discussion of this phenomenon). Another\nreason responsibility for oppression is distinctive is that persons\nmay contribute to a group\u2019s oppression simply by participating\nin a system of oppression, but not directly harboring sexist (or\nracist, etc.) intentions or even acting in ways that directly harm\nothers, which are two factors that we ordinarily use to implicate\nindividuals for immoral actions. On the one hand, holding all men\nresponsible for women\u2019s oppression in virtue of men\u2019s\n(perhaps unwilling) participation in the system seems to be too strong\na view, but on the other hand, freeing from responsibility all men on\nthe grounds that they do not harbor ill intentions or cause direct\nharm to women seems to be too weak, since it seems that someone is\nresponsible for maintaining any system of oppression. Charles\nLawrence, a race theorist, notes that \u201cThe racist acts of\nmillions of individuals are mutually reinforcing and cumulative\nbecause the status quo of institutionalized white supremacy remains\nlong after deliberate racist actions subside\u201d (Lawrence 1993,\n61). But even though institutionalization of racism and sexism may\nseem to free from responsibility individuals who participate in these\nsystems because the systems continue without deliberate racist or\nsexist acts, it is arguably the case that certain individuals directly\nhelp to ensure that the system is maintained through their actions,\nand it is unclear that negligence, ignorance, or self-deception about\nthe existence of systematic injustice are innocent motives. A\ngroup\u2019s oppression is likely to be sustained if no one is held\nresponsible and no subsequent action taken to end it. Rather than\ninvoking either extreme position, most feminists argue that\nresponsibility for sustaining oppression should be determined by\nfactors such as whether ignorance of or failure to attend to\nsystematic oppression is excusable, the nature of the indirect harm\ncaused by mere participation in the system of oppression, and whether\na person\u2019s opting out of an oppressive system will have any\nimpact on that system. Another complication in assigning\nresponsibility is that it is often difficult to separate an\nindividual\u2019s own sexist behavior from systematic sexism.\n\nThe literature reveals a variety of feminist views on the\nresponsibility of members of the dominant group for the oppression of\nmembers of subordinate groups. Cheshire Calhoun defends one of the\nmore lenient positions (Calhoun 1989). Calhoun argues that in\n\u201cnormal moral contexts,\u201d where a person has generally good\nmoral reasoning skills and generally is able to figure out which\nactions are right, wrong, or controversial, a person\u2019s moral\nignorance is inexcusable. But in \u201cabnormal moral\ncontexts,\u201d those in which a subgroup of society \u201cmakes\nadvances in moral knowledge faster than they can be disseminated to\nand assimilated by the general public and subgroups at special moral\nrisk,\u201d a person\u2019s moral ignorance is excusable (396). Such\nis the case when feminists have moral knowledge that the general\npublic lacks because the public is not familiar with either\nsophisticated analyses of oppression, or the special new terminology\nand new categories that are not shared by nonfeminists (e.g.,\n\u201cmarginalize,\u201d \u201cthe Other,\u201d \u201cmarriage as\nprostitution\u201d). In abnormal moral contexts where ignorance is\nthe norm, persons lack a motive to be morally reflective, so it is not\nthe case that they ought to have known better. Calhoun concludes that\nmany men are not responsible for their participation in women\u2019s\noppression on the grounds that they are not culpably ignorant of the\nmoral knowledge that feminists have. Nevertheless, Calhoun argues that\nwe should reproach participants in oppressive systems, since excusing\nthem has the effect of sanctioning their wrongdoing or letting it\npass. Her hope is to motivate people to act otherwise and to treat\nthem as capable of self-legislation rather than mere products of\nsocial conditioning. Similarly, Samantha Brennan urges that in order\nto motivate change, the appropriate response to microinequities is to\nraise awareness about their occurrence, but not to trace back each one\nof them to a specific person upon whom sole responsibility falls\n(Brennan 2013, 193).\n\nMichele Moody-Adams defends a less lenient view about responsibility\nfor oppression than Calhoun\u2019s, dismissing in many cases the role\nof culture as a factor that justifies willful moral ignorance and that\non these grounds exempts from responsibility those who act wrongly\n(Moody-Adams 1994). Her target is the view that being from a certain\nculture and adopting its practices absolves a person from\nresponsibility for his actions. More specifically, she questions\nwhether being unable to know, due to one\u2019s upbringing in a\nculture, that certain actions are wrong, and being unable to question\nthe morality of the society\u2019s practices, absolves a person from\nresponsibility for his actions. She defines \u201caffected\nignorance\u201d as \u201cchoosing not to know what one can and\nshould know\u201d (296), as when we \u201cask no questions\u201d\nwhen we suspect wrongdoing, or when we fail to acknowledge our human\nfallibility by hiding behind and blaming our culture for our own\nwrongdoing. Moody-Adams believes that moral ignorance is more a matter\nof our failings as human beings, and less a matter of \u201ccultural\nlimitations,\u201d than some might believe. She argues against the\nmoral ignorance position by noting that cultures are both created and\ntransmitted by the people in them, that people modify or even\nradically revise them through their individual actions, and that\npeople often act against cultural norms and sometimes act on desires\nthat are in line with these norms but in ways not sanctioned by the\nculture (305). In short, cultures persist only because individuals\ncapable of responsible action persist (292\u2013293). Absolving from\nresponsibility members of a culture for the wrongdoings that take\nplace in the context of their culture misunderstands the tight\nconnection between culture and agency, and denies the humanity of\nthose who are rationally unimpaired and commit wrongdoing, even when\nthey are influenced by cultural norms (306).\n\nTracy Isaacs assumes that persons are all to some extent influenced by\nthe cultural context in which we live, and agrees with Moody-Adams\nthat there are times when we should not excuse persons, even when they\nare culturally influenced, for their part in wrongs that fit into a\nscheme of culturally accepted practices that is not recognized as\nwrong, including some sexist and racist practices (Isaacs 2011).\nHowever, contra Moody-Adams, Isaacs argues that not every case of\nwidespread moral ignorance is a case of affected ignorance, that is,\nof choosing not to know whether some practice in which one\nparticipates might be wrong, and in these cases, one\u2019s ignorance\nmay be truly nonculpable (161). According to Isaacs, persons may be\nexcused for wrongdoings associated with wrongful social practices when\nthey lack equal access to the full range of actual and possible moral\nknowledge, or when moral discoveries are not immediately known or\nknowable by everyone because they have not yet become commonplace\n(163\u2013164). Isaacs compares advances in moral knowledge to those\nabout knowledge of the natural world; in either case, there are some\nthings we can only know given a certain stage in the history of\nknowledge (163). Isaacs invokes Calhoun\u2019s distinction between\nmoral knowledge in normal moral contexts as opposed to moral knowledge\nin abnormal moral contexts, where only those moral\n\u201cexperts\u201d such as feminists, and members of disadvantaged\ngroups who may not be moral \u201cexperts\u201d but who have special\nmoral insights due to their experiences, acquire new moral knowledge\nabout which outsiders are unaware. Isaacs believes that the root of\nthe issue of responsibility lies with shifting a society from an\nabnormal moral context to a normal moral context, for it is in the\nlatter where appeals to ignorance are no longer excusable. While\nCalhoun argues that the best way for this shift to take place is\nthrough reproach, e.g., labeling as sexist people who use the term\n\u201cgirl\u201d instead of \u201cwoman\u201d to refer to adult\nfemales, Isaacs favors dialogue in which traditional views are\nchallenged by moral \u201cexperts,\u201d members of disadvantaged\ngroups, and the like. The shift in context is achieved, she notes,\nwhen individuals come to see themselves as responsible (174). For\nexample, our society has shifted sufficiently such that no one who\nwrites for a living can legitimately claim to be ignorant about gender\nneutral pronouns used in place of the male pronoun, and thus no one in\nthis group is excused for being ignorant about this matter.\n\nBut there are other, much less lenient views about responsibility for\nthe harms of oppression that some feminists and race theorists\nadvocate. These accounts arguably ground responsibility in features\nthat are independent of cultural influence, by employing the notion of\nhumanity, the view that all persons are equal in some fundamental\nsense that transcends gender and race. One way to flesh out this view\nis to invoke Immanuel Kant\u2019s notion of humanity, that all\npersons are rational, autonomous beings possessing dignity and\ndeserving of respect. In short, they have intrinsic value in virtue of\nbeing persons. According to the accounts of responsibility at issue,\nmembers of socially dominant groups, or, \u201cthe privileged,\u201d\nare responsible for knowing and acting on these basic facts about\nhumanity that they share with their subordinates (Zack, 1998,\n42\u201343; Superson, 2004). That is, in spite of the fact that\noppression is a difficult concept to grasp, and notwithstanding\nCalhoun\u2019s and Isaacs\u2019s points about feminists having\nspecial knowledge that is not shared by the general public, the\nprivileged ought to recognize, acknowledge, and respect their\nsubordinates in virtue of these features common to all persons, even\nif patriarchal and racist societies muddle these facts about humanity\nby, for example, stereotyping all members of the subordinate group.\nSince knowing that all persons are equal in certain basic respects is\na simple matter, defenders of this view do not want to absolve from\nresponsibility those who disrespect others\u2019 humanity. At best,\nresponsibility ascriptions might be made on the basis of the degree of\ndifficulty involved in sorting through patriarchal or racist norms and\nrecognizing that a particular behavior does, indeed, violate a\nperson\u2019s humanity.\n\nA further wrinkle in the debate about moral responsibility in the\ncontext of oppression is evidenced in subtle cases of sexism in which\nthe agent is unaware of their sexism. An issue that nicely illustrates\nthis phenomenon is that of implicit bias. This topic in moral\npsychology has recently gained a lot of attention and has showcased\none of the ways in which philosophy can be enriched by empirical\nstudies (see the entry on\n implicit bias;\n and Brownstein and Saul 2016a and 2016b). Jennifer Saul defines\n\u201cimplicit bias\u201d as unconscious biases that affect the way\nwe perceive, evaluate, or interact with people from the group that our\nbiases \u2018target\u2019 (Saul 2013, 40). Saul points to\npsychological research that shows that most people, including those\nwho profess to have egalitarian views and even those who are members\nof subordinate groups, harbor implicit biases against women and other\nminority groups. For example, Implicit Association tests, now taken by\nmillions of people, that ask subjects to pair positive and negative\nadjectives with pictures of black and white faces, reveal that we are\nmuch quicker to pair black faces with negative adjectives than with\npositive ones (Brownstein and Saul 2016b, 1). Implicit biases are\nlikely to cash out, without the agent\u2019s conscious awareness, in\nways that harm members of subordinate groups to which certain\nstereotypes are applied. Saul links the phenomenon of implicit bias to\nwomen\u2019s underrepresentation in philosophy: in a tradition that\nis steeped in associating reason, objectivity, and philosophical\nthought with maleness, and emotion, subjectivity, and the\nnon-philosophical with femaleness, it is likely that philosophers will\ndisplay implicit bias against women when it comes to nonanonymous\njournal submissions, cvs for hiring, service loads, and\nclassroom incivility (Saul 2013, 41, 43, 45).\n\nGiven that implicit biases are largely unconscious and resistant to\nthe agent\u2019s direct efforts to change or control them by force of\nwill or mere intention (Brownstein and Saul 2016b, 2), can the agent\nbe morally responsible for having them? Robin Zheng illustrates the\ntension between holding and not holding agents morally responsible for\ntheir own implicit biases (Zheng 2016). Zheng notes that, on the one\nhand, because we are often unaware of our implicit biases and so\ncannot control their influence, we do not seem to be responsible for\nthem. But on the other hand, because implicit biases are the products\nand the perpetrators of social inequality, it seems right to hold\nagents responsible for them (62). Zheng\u2019s proposal is to have\ntwo accounts of responsibility in cases of implicit bias. One is\nresponsibility as attributability, according to which we are morally\nresponsible when our actions reflect who we are as moral agents\nbecause they are manifestations of our ends, commitments, or values\n(62). Because we are often unaware of our implicit biases, on the\nattributability account of responsibility, we would be off the hook\nfor behaviors that stem from them. Zheng argues for absolving from\nattributable responsibility a person who would not upon reflection\nendorse the influence of implicit bias on their action and who has\ndone what they can reasonably be expected to do to avoid and respond\nto the implicit bias once they are made aware of it (72). A second\nkind of responsibility is what Zheng calls \u201caccountability\nresponsibility,\u201d according to which we are responsible for our\nactions when it is appropriate for others to enforce certain\nexpectations and demands on those actions (63). In the case of\nimplicit biases, Zheng believes that we can be attributively not\nresponsible for our biases while being accountable for them. Zheng is\nlenient in the ways that Isaacs and Brennan are in that she urges that\nwe not hold others attributively responsible for conditions like\nimplicit bias, at least for the reasons that it is nearly impossible\nto determine whether they harbor them in particular cases, and that\npeople are more likely to do better without accusations of sexism and\nthe like (78).\n3.2 Taking Another\u2019s Perspective\n\nAnother contribution feminists have made to the issue of\nresponsibility is the notion of taking another\u2019s perspective.\nNaomi Zack identifies the problem with racists, which, I believe, can\nbe applied to sexists, as being that a racist \u201clacks basic moral\nor ethical impulses to identify with other living beings [who are not\nmembers of the group with which the racist or sexist\nidentifies],\u201d and that such identification \u201crests on the\nability to seriously imagine oneself in the place of another\u201d\n(1998, 42\u201343). Being able to imagine oneself in another\u2019s\nplace allows a person to realize that being the object of racism is a\npainful experience, and then to take steps to stop racist behavior\nboth in themselves and in others. This bears on the issue of\nresponsibility in the following way: those in the dominant class might\nclaim that they are unable to take the perspective of the\nnon-privileged, and since \u201c\u2018ought\u2019 implies\n\u2018can\u2019,\u201d they have no obligation to do so (Superson,\n2004, 47).\n\nFeminists have made several suggestions about how the privileged might\ncome to take the perspective of the non-privileged. Sandra Bartky and\nIris Young have identified the phenomena of \u201ccultural\ndomination,\u201d or \u201ccultural imperialism,\u201d according to\nwhich the non-privileged are made to see most things in a culture from\nthe perspective of the dominant group, which serves to erase the\nimportance, if not the identity, of those in the former group (Bartky\n1990, 25; Young 1988, 285\u2013286). We might think that if the\nnon-privileged can be made to see things from the perspective of the\ndominant group, the latter are capable of seeing things from the\nperspective of the former. The first step to take in seeing things\nfrom the perspective of the oppressed might be to disaffiliate oneself\nfrom one\u2019s privilege. So argues Marilyn Frye about white\nwomen\u2019s disaffiliating themselves from their whiteliness (1995).\nFrye argues that white women feminists should stop constantly making\nthemselves \u201cwhitely,\u201d which she defines as a character of\npersons similar to masculinity whereby a person does not admit to\nbeing prejudiced, biased, and mean, yet at the same time is\npretentious, rude, condescending, overbearing, and patronizing.\nWhiteliness interferes with white women\u2019s ability to form\nalliances with women of other races, and even though\n\u201cunbecoming\u201d whitely will not eradicate racism, Frye\nbelieves it is a necessary step to doing so.\n\nMaria Lugones takes Frye\u2019s proposal a step further, introducing\nthe notion of \u201cworld-traveling,\u201d defined as\n\u201ctraveling\u201d to the world of others who occupy a different\nposition in the social hierarchy (1995). Lugones believes that\nworld-traveling allows the privileged to come to see things from the\nperspective of the oppressed and even to come to see how the oppressed\nsee the privileged: world-traveling will aid in overcoming cultural\nimperialism. Lugones notes that white women, for instance, have an\nobligation out of friendship to abandon their imperialism and come to\nsee things from the perspective of Hispanic women. We might apply\nLugones\u2019s idea more generally to the privileged and the\noppressed. To understand the notion of world-traveling, Lugones uses\nthe example of whether she is playful or not: in some worlds she finds\nthat she is, but in other worlds, she finds that she is serious.\nWhether she is playful, or more accurately, seen as playful,\nis a matter of how the dominant group constructs the concept of\nplayfulness. Lugones believes that in order to world-travel, one needs\nto give up the arrogant construction of concepts from one\u2019s own\nperspective. We can apply Lugones\u2019s notion of world-traveling to\nthe idea discussed in Section 3.1 of coming to see the non-privileged\nas being equal in humanity to the privileged. The privileged would\nhave to see the non-privileged as likes by directing their attention\naway from themselves and toward the nonprivileged, by appreciating the\npersonhood status of the nonprivileged, and by coming to understand\nthe complex hurts involved in oppression which requires recognizing\nthe interconnections between the systematically related barriers and\nforces that keep a group oppressed (Superson 2004, 38\u201349).\nFurther, in Lugones\u2019 words, the privileged would have to\nunderstand not as an observer but as a participant in a particular\nworld.\n\nBut not all feminists believe that the privileged can\n\u2018world-travel.\u2019 Laurence Thomas, for instance, argues that\nthe privileged cannot come to know the position of their subordinates\nbecause they cannot even grasp the latter\u2019s experiences (1999).\nAccording to Thomas, heterosexual men cannot imagine how a female rape\nvictim feels, since they cannot imagine the fear of rape that most if\nnot all women feel, and do not have to deal with social attitudes that\nmake them targets of sexual violence. By the same token, a white\nperson does not know what it is for a black person to experience a\nfeeling of being a second-class citizen when attacked by a group of\nwhites, nor can a white person come to know it if attacked by a group\nof blacks. Thomas believes that in oppressive societies, the\nprivileged are socially constituted differently from the oppressed,\nand so have different emotional configurations, making them experience\nthings in different ways (186). Being viewed as less than full and\nequal members of society, and having painful memories of these\nexperiences, are necessary conditions for the privileged\nperson\u2019s being able to take the perspective of the oppressed,\nwhich he is simply unable to do given his social condition. Whether\nthis absolves the privileged from responsibility for oppression is not\nsomething Thomas addresses in the context of this discussion, but he\nargues that the privileged have an obligation to engage in\n\u201cmoral deference,\u201d that is, to defer to those who speak in\nan informed way about experiences specific to their position of\nsubordination to which others do not have access. He asserts that any\nmorally decent, self-respecting person should listen to\nanother\u2019s moral story and acquire sensibility to the way in\nwhich that person lives in the world as a member of an oppressed group\n(189).\n\nSome philosophers invoke more traditional philosophical tools such as\nanalogies to get those in dominant groups to take the perspective of\nthose in subordinate groups. Judith Jarvis Thomson, in her seminal\narticle on abortion (1971), offers science-fiction-like analogies that\nserve as ways for men and women alike to imagine themselves in the\nposition of women who are considering the moral status of abortion in\ncases of rape, when the mother\u2019s life is at stake, and when\ncontraception has failed. The analogies require men, who do not\nexperience pregnancy, to imagine what it would be like to have a\nkidnapped violinist hooked up to them for nine months, or to be\ntrapped in a house with a rapidly growing baby that will crush them to\ndeath, or to live in a house with fine mesh screens only to have\npeople seeds drift in and take root in the carpeting and upholstery\nand grow into full-fledged persons for whom they are responsible.\nFeminist philosophers who write from a personal perspective attempt to\nget those in the dominant group to take the perspective of those in\nthe subordinate group by describing in detail their experience of\nbeing a victim of a sexist act or practice (see Section 5).\n3.3 Collective Responsibility\n\nSome feminists have recently introduced the notion of collective\nresponsibility, which would serve to hold men as a group responsible\nfor aspects of women\u2019s oppression. Writing about rape in\nparticular, which we can take to be a facet of women\u2019s\noppression, Larry May and Robert Strikwerda argue that in some\nsocieties, men are collectively responsible for rape because most if\nnot all men contribute to its prevalence (1999, 722). According to May\nand Strikwerda, rape is a crime perpetrated by men as a group, not\njust by the individual rapist. Acts of rape take place in what is\ncalled a \u201crape culture,\u201d in which individual men are more\nlikely to engage in rape when they are in groups, and men are strongly\nencouraged to rape by being socialized to be patriarchal men. May and\nStrikwerda cite data that young men in our society engage in more rape\nthan previously thought, and that rapists are not significantly\npsychologically different from other males in our society. They agree\nwith research suggesting that all-male groups socialize their members\nand provide cultural \u201ccues\u201d for violence, which serves as\nevidence that rape is not best thought of as an isolated act performed\nby just the rapist. They defend what they call \u201cdistributive\ncollective responsibility,\u201d which is the view that men form a\ngroup in which there are many features, including attitudes or\ndispositions to harm others, common to all or most members of the\ngroup, making what is true for one man true for all other men\n(728).\n\nThe key to understanding distributive collective responsibility is\nunderstanding patriarchy as being based on common interests and\nbenefits extended to all men in a given society, and rendering each at\nleast partially responsible for the harms of patriarchy. All men\nbenefit from the existence of rape because women are made to feel\ndependent on men for protection from rapists. Significantly, May and\nStrikwerda argue that some men, in the way they interact with other\nmen, contribute to a climate in which rape is made more prevalent,\nsuch as when they participate in the practice of \u201cmale\nbonding\u201d which separates them from women who they deem to be\n\u201cother.\u201d Moreover, some men would be rapists if given the\nopportunity, since they share the same attitudes as rapists about rape\nand about women. Such factors make men collectively responsible for\nrape, and thus for at least part of women\u2019s oppression. In\nanother article on shared responsibility and racist attitudes, whose\narguments apply equally to sexist attitudes, May argues that\n\u201cinsofar as people share in the production of an attitudinal\nclimate, they participate in something like a joint venture that\nincreases the likelihood of harm\u201d (1992, 47). May expands on\ntraditional, individualistic responsibility accounts by assigning at\nleast some responsibility to those who themselves do not commit racist\nacts, but who harbor racist attitudes in a climate in which others are\nthereby more likely to act on their racist attitudes and cause harm.\nThus a person can share responsibility for harms the person does not\ndirectly cause: men who harbor sexist attitudes contribute to a\nclimate in which other men who have sexist attitudes act on them, and\nare partly responsible for the harmful behavior.\n3.4 Responsibility of the Oppressed for Immorality\n\nThe issue of whether the oppressed are responsible for immorality can\nbe broken down into two questions: Are the oppressed free from\nresponsibility for immoral acts unrelated to their own oppression on\nthe grounds that their socialization plays some role in their acting\nimmorally? Are the oppressed responsible for contributing to their own\noppression by not resisting it? This section takes up the first\nquestion; Section 3.5 takes up the second question.\n\nWhile earlier, non-feminist philosophical treatments of an\nindividual\u2019s responsibility for her or his own behavior have\ntypically focused on the role an individual has played in causing a\ncertain outcome, more recent discussions, particularly by race\ntheorists and to a lesser extent feminists, shift away from causation\ntalk and acknowledge the significance of the influence of social\nforces on an agent\u2019s actions and the degree to which they might\nmitigate the agent\u2019s responsibility for her or his actions. It\nis striking, however, that feminists have had little to say about\nlessening women\u2019s responsibility for their immoral\nactions when the reasons women act are largely influenced by their\ntreatment under patriarchy. Some race theorists, though, have\ndiscussed this issue. I. A. Menkiti, for instance, explores how social\ndeviants, or, psychopaths come to be (1977\u20131978). Menkiti\ndefines a psychopath as one who is outside morality in the sense that\nhe does not care about others or accept responsibility, and feels no\nguilt, regret, shame, or remorse. Menkiti argues that some psychopaths\nhave been made into the beings they are by social injustice that\ngenerates economic deprivation for people in their group, which\nconstantly challenges their self-esteem, causing them to go through a\nseries of stages from that of resentment, to that of embitterment, to\nthat of moral death (227\u2013230). Menkiti argues that the community\nis at least partly responsible for the behavior of psychopaths who\nriot or gang bang in response both to unbearable poverty brought about\nby conscious discrimination directed at them in virtue of their group\nmembership, and to institutionalized racial exclusion. This is because\nthe community plays a significant role in their becoming psychopaths.\nMenkiti believes that it is unfair to blame individuals for primarily\ninstitutional failures (236). He muses that philosophers have shied\naway from this kind of collective responsibility because it traces the\ncausal connection too far, but he urges that it makes just as much\nsense to consider society a culprit as it does to say that societies\nare victims of crimes and that there are debts owed to society\n(237).\n\nThe paucity of feminist discussion of this kind of argument as applied\nto women may be due partly to the view that women\u2019s response to\ntheir oppression typically has been to internalize it by acquiring\ndeformed desires (see Section 2) and adopting stereotypical traits and\nroles such as becoming servile. Such behaviors do not strike many of\nus as being as immoral as rioting and gang banging, and if they are\nnot immoral, then the question about whether women are unfairly held\nresponsible for them does not even arise. Indeed, feminists have had\nto make a special case that, for instance, a woman\u2019s adopting\nstereotypical traits and roles is immoral because it harms women as a\ngroup (see Section 3.5), or that servility is immoral because it\nviolates a duty to be self-respecting, as Kant believed. Some\nfeminists even reject these views. Cynthia Stark argues against\nKant\u2019s view that any rational being would on reflection see\nhimself as an end in itself. Stark points out that characters like the\nDeferential Wife have deeply socially (patriarchally) constituted\nidentities that are often incompatible with a conception of themselves\nas persons (1997, 76\u201377). She argues that Kant\u2019s view is\ntoo harsh in not taking into account the agent\u2019s circumstances,\nexpecting everyone to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and be\nself-respecting.\n\nPaul Benson is one feminist who makes this point about the\nagent\u2019s circumstances and relates it to women\u2019s\nresponsibility for immoral action (2000, 79\u201385). Benson argues\nfor imposing a self-worth condition on responsibility. He argues that\nin order for an agent to be morally responsible, it must be the case\nthat we can hold her responsible for her actions. For this, a person\nhas to be worthy of a social standing, that of an eligible participant\nin moral exchanges that involve, for example, offering reasons,\nseeking to be excused, begging forgiveness, and blaming someone. Being\na participant in such moral exchanges requires that the person respond\nto moral treatment such as blame, and that she recognize the\nlegitimacy of this demand. It is appropriate to hold someone\nresponsible just in case it is appropriate to hold the person to the\ndemand for a suitable response, but, significantly for feminist\npurposes, it requires that the person to whom the response is directed\ndoes not regard herself as unworthy of this kind of moral exchange.\nOne factor that can interfere with the agent\u2019s regard for her\nown worth, according to Benson, is the internalization of oppressive\nsocial norms. Not having proper regard for one\u2019s own worth may\ninvolve not believing that it is one\u2019s place to take\nresponsibility for one\u2019s actions. In such cases, it is not\nappropriate to hold these agents fully responsible for their actions.\nOne feature distinguishing Benson\u2019s account from non-feminist\naccounts of responsibility that determine responsibility on the basis\nof features like having a capacity for critical reflection, being able\nto make choices, and knowing what one is doing, is the fact that\nBenson\u2019s account is sensitive to a person\u2019s sense of her\nworth as it is affected by internalizing oppressive social norms.\n\nBenson himself believes that his account of responsibility is feminist\nbecause it is relational, which means that it reflects our connections\nto others instead of reflecting a view of persons that many feminists\nreject, namely, as abstract, individualistic, or atomistic\nself-governing and self-sufficient agents. Benson cites several ways\nin which his account is relational. One is that it requires that the\nagent have a sufficient account of her worth to be accountable to\nothers, and this requires that there be others. More specifically, the\naccount expects a person to speak for her own actions to others, which\nis necessary for becoming a responsible agent and acquiring the right\nsense of her worth. One \u201cmakes oneself\u201d in an\ninterpersonal context, which many feminists take to be necessary for\nmoral agency. A second reason Benson\u2019s account is relational,\nand so feminist, is that publicly shareable norms govern the\nagent\u2019s actions and her own account of them to others.\nSubordination and domination threaten this account of norms, Benson\nargues, by making it impossible for persons to understand how they\ncould defend or excuse their own conduct. Third, being responsible is\na matter of having the status of being an eligible participant in a\ncommunity of moral dialogue in which the parties regard themselves as\nbeing in a position to speak for their own agency in response to\ncriticism from others, and can hold themselves responsible. If we\nexempt women from responsibility, Benson worries, we fail at least in\nsome cases to respect their status as equal participants in this\ndialogue, which is sexist. So if a woman recognizes herself as having\nintrinsic worth and being able to speak for her own agency, it would\nbe disrespectful and sexist not to hold her responsible.\n\nBenson suggests that mitigating women\u2019s responsibility for\nimmoral action runs the risk of undermining women\u2019s moral\nagency. This might be another reason for the scarcity of feminist\ndiscussion about the role of socialization in women\u2019s\nresponsibility for immoral action. The worry is that if an agent is\nunder the sway of her socialization or circumstances, she seems to be\na mere pawn who does not or cannot take control over her actions.\nAbsolving women from responsibility for their behavior not only risks\ndenying their agency, but risks perpetuating sexist stereotypes. This\nis what worries Wanda Teays about using the excusing model of\nself-defense for abused women who kill their abusers (1998,\n61\u201364). Under this model, an abused woman is excused from\nkilling her abuser either because she did not realize that she was\nviolating the law, or because she could not prevent herself from\nbreaking it presumably because she was under the sway of her emotions.\nIn either case, the focus is on her, the actor, excusing her because\nof some characteristic she possesses or her state of mind, implying\nthat she is mentally impaired or not reasonable. Teays favors the\njustifying model, which acknowledges that the woman is reasonable in\nthe sense that there is nothing wrong with her or her reasoning\nskills, and that she responds appropriately, given her circumstances.\nThis model neither compromises the woman\u2019s agency nor\nperpetuates sexist stereotypes about women\u2019s mental states. It\ndescribes these women not as being under the sway of their emotions,\nbut as being able to determine in a rational way when self-defense is\nwarranted. Feminists might apply this model more generally to explain\nthe relevance of women\u2019s circumstances to their responsibility\nor blameworthiness for acting immorally.\n\nOne such view, though not put forward as a feminist one, is offered by\nSarah Buss in response to Susan Wolf\u2019s case of the Victim of a\nDeprived Childhood. Wolf argues that such a person, who was given no\nlove and was beaten by his father and neglected by his mother, is not\nresponsible for embezzling money later in life (1986). Although he has\nfeatures that typically would make him responsible, such as not being\ncoerced, being in control of his behavior, and having a normal faculty\nof reason, he is absolved from responsibility because he could not\nhave had reason to act morally instead of embezzling. This is\nbecause, despite there being reasons for acting morally, the reasons\nthe Victim of a Deprived Childhood has are determined by his\ncircumstances. That is, there are reasons not to embezzle, but this\nkind of agent, due to his circumstances, fails to see, and cannot\nreasonably be expected to see, that there are such moral reasons. To\novercome his background and see that there are moral reasons not to\nembezzle, he would have to have a certain kind of sensibility and\nperception that he lacks. Since we cannot reasonably expect this kind\nof agent to see that there is reason not to embezzle, and because the\nreasons he does see are determined by his circumstances, Wolf believes\nthat his actions stemming from these reasons are determined, so he is\nneither blameworthy nor responsible for embezzling. However, the view\nthat one\u2019s reasons are determined by one\u2019s circumstances\nthreatens a view of moral agency according to which a person can\nfreely choose among available reasons. Were feminists to draw the same\nconclusion about women who internalize their own oppression such as\nthe Deferential Wife described above (Section 1), they would run into\nthe worry about denying women moral agency.\n\nSarah Buss argues against Wolf\u2019s view in a way that is not\nagency-denying, because rather than appealing to the agent\u2019s\ncircumstances as determining his reasons, Buss believes that such\ncircumstances give this kind of agent a justified failure to\n\u201ctell right from wrong\u201d (1997). Buss embellishes\nWolf\u2019s example of the Victim, who as a child came into contact\nmostly with people who either beat him, supported those who beat him,\nor ignored his misery. Whenever the victim was beaten, he was first\ntaunted. Years later, when he is taunted with a threatening comment,\nhe hits his taunter. Buss believes that the Victim is responsible for\nhitting his taunter, since there are moral reasons not to hit one who\ntaunts you: hitting one\u2019s taunter is morally wrong. But Buss\nbelieves that the Victim is justified in hitting his taunter because\nhe has excusing reasons to act thusly, which are grounded in his\ncircumstances. Excusing reasons free him and other similar agents from\nblame, at least in certain circumstances, depending on the nature of\nthe wrongdoing, whether there are alternative actions available, and\nthe details of his background. Generally speaking, he can be absolved\nfrom blame because he has a justified failure to tell right\nfrom wrong\u2014anyone in his circumstances has reason to act the way\nhe does, even though they also have reason not to act immorally. Buss\ndefends what she calls \u201cthe Basic Intuition,\u201d according to\nwhich \u201csimply because they have exceptional backgrounds, certain\nwrongdoers have a different moral status from that of more\n\u2018privileged\u2019 wrongdoers who perform the very same type of\nacts\u201d (337). A person would have to be truly exceptional not to\nsee things as the Victim sees them and write off his experiences as\nones not indicative of human nature. Buss offers this analogy: the\nVictim no more has good reason for thinking that his taunter is not\nlike the hostile people he grew up around, than does the person who\nhas been bitten repeatedly by dogs has good reason to think that the\ngrowling dog in her path will not bite her (350). The Basic Intuition\nattributes to the victim not an incapacity for making the correct\nmoral distinctions, but a justified failure to \u201ctell right from\nwrong.\u201d He has excusing reasons for acting as he does.\nBuss\u2019s non-deterministic argument might be employed by feminists\nas an agency-protecting way of absolving women from blame for certain\nimmoral acts. They might also use it to absolve women from\nresponsibility, if they can show that the acts in question are in\nthemselves justified, perhaps by showing that they are legitimate\nresponses to threats to a person\u2019s intrinsic value (see Superson\n2010).\n3.5 Responsibility for Resisting One\u2019s Own Oppression; Victim-blaming\n\nAre the oppressed responsible for contributing to their own oppression\nby not resisting it?\n\nNot only men, but women contribute to women\u2019s oppression, not by\ndirectly causing it, but by sustaining it through their attitudes and\nbehavior. \u201cRight-wing\u201d women are those whose lifestyles\nlargely reflect right-wing values, and for the reason that they\nbelieve that women belong in stereotypical roles (Superson 1993). They\npossess the same attitudes about women as do sexist men. This\nconception excludes women who on occasion engage in right-wing\nbehavior, for reasons other than because they believe women ought to\nadopt stereotypical roles. The property of being right-wing can more\nor less reflect prevalent sexist stereotypes. Many right-wing women\nhave deformed desires (see Section 2). Other women who neither endorse\npatriarchal values nor have deformed desires choose roles that when\nenough other women also choose them, perpetuate sexist stereotypes\nabout women and thereby contribute to their own oppression. Are such\nwomen responsible and/or blameworthy for contributing to their own\noppression? On the one hand, sexist behavior, no matter who causes it,\nsustains women\u2019s oppression and harms women, so we might want to\nhold responsible and blame these women for their participation in the\nsystem. On the other hand, blaming women for their own oppression\nseems to blame the victim.\n\nFeminists are divided over whether women are responsible and/or\nblameworthy for contributing to their own oppression. Some believe\nthat women\u2019s strong indoctrination into patriarchal beliefs and\nvalues makes it likely that they would come to have them (Bartky\n1999a; Luker 1984; Nussbaum 1999a; Superson 1993). For example, some\nreligious, particularly Christian, right-wing women adopt and act on\npatriarchal values because they believe this is the way things ought\nto be as part of God\u2019s plan, while some secular right-wing women\nadopt patriarchal values because they believe that oppression is\nunalterable and that conformity is their best option. Some feminists\nbelieve that such right-wing women fail completely to understand\nfeminism, and fail to see that their choice of lifestyle limits their\nchoices even further (Superson 1993). Blaming entails judging the one\nblamed as morally remiss. But if women really do not understand\nfeminism and fail to see that their choice of lifestyle is\nnon-liberating, these feminists find it as inappropriate to blame or\nhold responsible women for their role in their own oppression as it is\nto blame or hold responsible rape victims for rape who play no moral\nrole in their own harm.\n\nYet other feminists might blame or hold responsible women who do not\nresist their own oppression. Some argue that women have an obligation\nto resist their own oppression, at least under certain conditions, and\nso are responsible for resisting. Carol Hay responds to the view that\nwomen\u2019s having an obligation to resist their own oppression\nunfairly restricts their choices and blames the victim (2005). Hay\nacknowledges that both external and internal forces of patriarchy,\nincluding deformed desires, often restrict a woman\u2019s autonomy,\nbut argues that this is not a sufficient reason not to require women\nto resist their oppression. She believes that women under patriarchy\nhave a fair degree of autonomy, and that autonomy is a necessary\ncondition for the possibility of moral obligation, which in turn is at\nleast partially constitutive of moral agency (105). She accepts as a\ngeneral principle that we should hold agents responsible only for\nactions that are undertaken autonomously: if the agent has no\nautonomy, she has no obligation, and if the agent is fully autonomous,\nshe is fully subject to all possible moral obligations that might\nexist in a situation (99). Hay also believes that it is unfair to\nrequire moral obligations of someone who is incapable of fulfilling\nthem. But she believes that demanding more responsibility of someone\nwho is capable of fulfilling their moral obligations because they have\nat least some degree of autonomy might end up increasing their\nautonomy. This is the case, Hay believes, for women under patriarchy.\nHay acknowledges that it may be unfair to burden women with an\nobligation to resist their oppression, but believes that women\u2019s\nfulfilling this obligation is essential to eliminating patriarchy in\naddition to increasing their autonomy. Indeed, she believes that this\nincreased burden is yet another reason to eliminate patriarchy\n(104\u2013105). Hay notes that whether a woman is in fact obligated\nto resist her oppression in a particular instance of sexism (e.g.,\nconfronting a sexual harasser) depends on the danger involved in doing\nso: when the risk of harm to herself is significant, she is free from\nthe obligation.\n\nAnn Cudd also argues that women have an obligation to resist their own\noppression. She takes up the case where women understand their\noppression and are not under the sway of deformed desires, and where\noppression is not so pervasive that it is impossible or seriously\nrisky to resist it (2006). She offers the case of Larry and Lisa, a\ncouple who agrees that it is best if one of them assumes most of the\nchildrearing duties. Given the existing gender wage gap, the couple\nreasons that it is rational for them to choose that Lisa opt out of\nthe paid labor force and raise the children. But her doing so, when\nenough other women do so as well, lends strength and stability to\nwomen\u2019s oppression because it makes employers perceive women as\nunreliable wage workers, which feeds the very stereotypical image that\ncreates the gender wage gap in the first place (199). Further,\nLisa\u2019s participating in a sexist division of labor increases the\nexpectation that other women will do the same. Cudd argues that Lisa\nneeds to weigh the benefit of the economic gain her family can expect\nif Larry is the wage worker against the harm caused by perpetuation of\nthe stereotype of women as primarily domestic workers and unreliable\nwage workers, and then do the least undeserved harm. Women like Lisa\nhave an obligation to sacrifice their immediate wants for a long-term\nvision of a better future (188). Cudd argues further that requiring\nthe oppressed to resist their oppression is not a case of wrongful\nblaming of the victim; rather, it is like the case of a person who\nsuffers a superficial cut by someone\u2019s careless use of sharp\nscissors, but who is to blame for some of the harm if he loses his\nhand to gangrene because he refuses to wash and care for the cut. Both\nvictims participate in some way in the harm they suffer, even though\nneither is the initial cause of the harm.\n\nIn contrast to feminists who defend an obligation to resist\noppression, Daniel Silvermint examines the phenomenon of\n\u201cpassing as privileged\u201d as a way to navigate one\u2019s\noppression so as to promote one\u2019s well-being. Silvermint\ndescribes \u201cpassing as privileged\u201d as occurring \u201cwhen\na member of an oppressed, stigmatized, or otherwise\ndiscriminated-against group x is passively or actively\nperceived to be a member of a privileged group y, thereby\nescaping the unjust barriers and burdens that come with being\nidentified as an x and/or accessing the advantages that come\nwith being (mis)identified as a y\u201d (Silvermint 2018,\n6). He is concerned mainly with \u201cactive passing,\u201d which is\na strategy used to create or avoid the perception of a certain kind of\nperson, such as when an immigrant family Anglicizes their last name in\norder to hide their naturalized status (3). His concern is whether a\nvictim of oppression ought to pass as a non-victim when they can\nsuccessfully do so.\n\nAccording to Silvermint, passing and resisting one\u2019s oppression\nshare the aim that they are both ways to improve one\u2019s life or\ncircumstances in the face of oppression (38). The main difference he\nsees between them is that persons who resist in various ways attempt\nto improve their well-being by undermining, changing, or escaping the\noppressive system that constrains their well-being, while persons who\nengage in passing as a member of a privileged group act in ways that\nsustain those constraints while attempting to exploit the way in which\nthey are distributed so as to avoid being constrained by them.\nEssentially, the latter make a trade-off between two valuable\nconstituents of their well-being, both of which cannot simultaneously\nbe promoted under oppression. For example, a trans woman might pass as\na cis-gender woman in order to avoid physical violence; a victim of\nstereotype threat might pass as a confident professional in order to\nsucceed (31); and a queer femme might pass as a cis-gender woman by\navoiding holding hands with her girlfriend in order to ward off an\ninsensitive co-worker (11). But unlike classic resisters, persons who\nengage in passing leave intact rather than challenge the very system\nthat harms them. Silvermint likens them to the teenager who is bullied\nand comes to school dressed like his bullies and engages in behavior\nsimilar to them and eventually gets accepted by them. Silvermint takes\nissue with three main arguments that passing is morally wrong, namely,\nthat it compromises the agent\u2019s authenticity, that it involves\ndeception, and that it harms fellow victims by reinforcing\nstereotypes. He instead defends the view that passing is a permissible\nform of self-regarding complicity on the grounds that persons who\nengage in passing are not responsible for being victims of oppression\nand are navigating their circumstances in the best way they can in\norder to promote their well-being (40).\n4. The Psychology of the Oppressor\n\nWhile there has been some feminist writing to date on the psychology\nof the oppressor, Robin Dillon calls for much more work in this area\n(Dillon 2012). In particular, Dillon urges that feminists develop what\nshe calls \u201ccritical character theory,\u201d a way of theorizing\ncharacter from a feminist perspective (85). Such a theory recognizes\nthat domination and subordination operate not just at the political\nand social levels, but through character. Among the things it asks is\nwhether certain traits might contribute to or undermine oppression. It\nis particularly concerned to speak to vice, which Dillon believes is\nfor the most part left out of moral theories. Knowing about vice is\nnot only intrinsically important, but it is important for how we raise\nour children and develop their moral characters, especially in regard\nto enabling them to combat oppression (91\u201392). A feminist moral\ntheory should examine how systematic oppression reflects and\nreinforces domination values, and how it normalizes and buttresses\nvice in members of dominant groups (94). It should also suggest how we\nmight repair character damage, not just externally, by making\nsystematic changes, but internally too. Dillon suggests that it might\nbe the case that repairing character is a necessary condition or at\nleast an effective way of transforming unjust social conditions like\noppression.\n\nDillon agrees with Lisa Tessman that oppression fosters certain vices\nin the privileged, including arrogance, self-centeredness,\ncallousness, indifference, and social irresponsibility, and adds that\nit damages the characters of those who perpetrate or are complicit in\noppression, and it does so in ways that the benefits of privilege do\nnot outweigh (96). Tessman argues that under oppression, the self can\nbe damaged in such a way that it cannot flourish (Tessman 2005, 4).\nShe develops the notion of \u201cburdened virtues,\u201d virtues one\nhas that are cultivated in an oppressive context. The privileged,\nparticularly ones who culpably passively accept their privilege, if\nnot positively endorse it, exhibit the \u201cordinary vices of\ndomination\u201d which prevent them from flourishing in spite of\nbenefiting. Aside from the vices already mentioned, the privileged\noften exhibit a lack of certain moral virtues, including compassion\nfor others not in their group, generosity, cooperativeness, and\nopenness to appreciating others (55). While the privileged can\nflourish among the privileged, and in this way meet Aristotle\u2019s\ncriteria for eudaimonia, they cannot flourish on a conception of\neudaimonia that reflects the fact of social inequality. Tessman argues\nthat moral goodness requires not only a pursuit of one\u2019s own\nwell-being and the well-being of others on whom one depends, as\nAristotle believes, but also the well-being of others whose lack of\nwell-being may have been a condition of one\u2019s privilege (76).\nTessman\u2019s attention to vice in the context of oppression is\nexactly the kind of work that Dillon believes might be essential in\nending oppression, and Dillon\u2019s own work on arrogance is likely\nto be followed by feminist progress in this area (Dillon 2004).\n\nBoth Dillon and Tessman are rejecting ideal theory as an approach to\ntheorizing character. According to Charles Mills, who also rejects it,\nideal theory represents the actual as a simple deviation from the\nideal that is not worth theorizing in its own right, or it falsely\nstates that starting from the ideal is the best way of realizing the\nideal (Mills 2005, 168). The problem is that ideal models abstract\naway in a problematic way from realities that are crucial to\nunderstanding injustice, such as structural domination, exploitation,\ncoercion, and oppression (170). In so doing, ideal theory represents\nthe experiences of the dominant group only, and thus serves their\ninterests (172). But since ethics is supposed to be about how actual\npeople act, and since ideal theory does not reflect the experiences of\nsubordinate groups, it is not the best way of doing ethics.\nTessman\u2019s work on \u201cimpossible cases\u201d critiques ideal\nmoral theory on the grounds that it fails to capture moral dilemmas\nwhich involve non-negotiable moral requirements which are grounded in\ninnate values such as love and life that cannot be unproblematically\ncompromised (e.g., killing your crying baby in order to protect a\ngroup from the Nazis) (Tessman 2017). We can imagine feminist cases of\nthis phenomenon, such as killing a rapist in order to protect your\ndignity.\n\nDillon\u2019s call for more work in critical character theory\nnotwithstanding, there is some earlier literature that is either\nexplicitly feminist or that can be used by feminists that speaks to\nthe psychology of members of the dominant group, men, who act in\nsexist ways, thereby contributing to women\u2019s oppression.\nFeminists and their supporters have offered explanations for how a\nsexist comes to be, examining in particular the role that a bad\nsociety, corrupt socialization, and the adoption of patriarchal values\nand beliefs play in his development. They have also attempted to\nexplain the underlying motivation in a person who engages in sexist or\nracist behavior that contributes to the oppression of a group.\n\nLaurence Thomas offers an account of how a society in which there is a\ngeneral lack of trust that others will not harm a person can make a\nperson come to cultivate indifference to harming others, if not worse\n(1996). Thomas\u2019s account can be applied to sexist forms of evil,\nor, immorality. He believes that society is adversely affected by the\nwide-scale absence of goodwill among its members, and that\ngame-theoretic models for social cooperation as offered by\ncontemporary moral and political theorists that do not acknowledge\nmotivation cannot accommodate this shortcoming (272). Thomas considers\nthe Golden Rule, which dictates that you \u201cDo unto others as you\nwould have them do unto you.\u201d He claims that rather than comply\nwith this rule out of fear, which shows a lack of respect for others,\nwe should comply in ways the rule was intended, out of the\nother-regarding motive of not wanting to cause another harm or\nsuffering, a feeling that is generated both by our own experience of\nbeing harmed and from the nature of human beings in general. For\ninstance, those who have this other-regarding motive will know what it\nis like to experience the moral pain of being a victim of a racial\nepithet, which should suffice to prevent him or her from using a\nracial epithet against others. In a moral climate, a person is more\nlikely to have this other-regarding sentiment, but in a society where\ntrust that others will not harm us is lacking, we are likely to lose\nit and develop virtue-derailing sentiments, first becoming indifferent\nto harming others, then morally numb, then eventually evil beings.\n\nThomas suggests that there is a parallel between the family structure\nand society with respect to the failure to develop the moral\nsensibilities that the Golden Rule calls for (273). It is only through\nparental love (or the love of parental surrogates), Thomas believes,\nthat self-love is securely underwritten (279). The child who is loved\nby his parents can first come to see himself as having intrinsic\nvalue, which is the basis for self-love. Self-love, in turn,\nunderwrites the other-regarding sentiments. Thomas is not suggesting\nthat all children who come from abusive homes will lack\nother-regarding sentiments and become evil persons, but instead is\nsaying that other-regarding sentiments have a more difficult time\ngaining a secure foothold in children in abusive homes than in loving\nones (281). This is because the abused child is typically consumed\nwith when and how he will be abused and how he will cope, his own\nwell-being and survival, and developing virtue-derailing motives, such\nas bitterness, rancor, and a desire for vengeance, which are at odds\nwith other-regarding sentiments. Thomas believes that in a similar\nway, a society where trust (that others who can harm us will not) is\nlacking impedes a person\u2019s having other-regarding sentiments\ntoward strangers that is called for by the Golden Rule. If we live in\na society in which we lack trust in others that they will not harm us,\nour concern with whether our own actions will not harm others will be\nsubstantially weakened, leading to indifference toward harming others,\nor, moral numbness. If the moral climate in society becomes bad\nenough, it will give rise to bitterness, rancor, and a desire for\nvengeance (285). Thomas believes that when we are the object of\nsystematic hostility, presumably the kind associated with systematic\nracism and sexism, a natural reaction on our part is to develop\nhostility, bitterness, and rancor. Although Thomas does not link his\ndiscussion to the cultivation of sexists per se, other philosophers\nwriting about evil, including feminists writing especially about the\nevil of oppression, explain the immoral character of members of the\ndominant group who act in sexist or racist ways toward those in\nsubordinate groups, by displaying indifference to their humanity, or,\nthe intrinsic value they have in virtue of being persons, as will be\ndiscussed later in this section (see also Section 3.1).\n\nLarry May is a feminist who has written specifically about the role of\nmale socialization in the cultivation of sexist attitudes and\nbehaviors in men. In one of his articles, May examines the\nsocialization practiced by formerly all-male military institutions\nsuch as the Citadel and the Virginia Military Institute (1998b). These\ninstitutions practice separatism in order to establish a male culture\nand instill traditional male values without pressure from the outside,\nparticularly from women. They are formed as places for boys to become\nmen or to prove they are men, perpetuating a form of masculinity\nsupported by other all-male sports settings, all-male clubs, and so on\n(117). In these military institutional settings, the conditions are\nstark, the quarters are tight and lack privacy, and the cadets are\nconsidered to be mere \u201crats,\u201d not unique persons deserving\nof respect, and are forced to suffer mental stress, punishment, even\nbeatings. The point of such treatment is for the cadets to develop\nself-discipline and spirit thought necessary for leadership skills and\ncharacter, to form a sense of bonding with fellow sufferers and former\ntormenters, and to channel young male aggression (118).\n\nThe problem, though, according to May, is that this training\nbackfires, and male aggression gets re-directed especially toward\nwomen: when the cadets think of themselves as \u201crats,\u201d\nrather than as persons deserving of respect, it is only a small step\nto thinking that women, who are generally portrayed as even less\ndeserving than themselves, are less than rats and beneath contempt\n(129). Men who go through this military training have trouble\ncontaining their aggression in simulated combat situations at least\npartly because when aggression is deemed acceptable, this sometimes\nmakes it more likely that a man will display more and stronger\naggression than would otherwise be the case (132). And sometimes the\nfact that this training forbids the cadets to show any aggression\ntoward the upperclassmen who verbally or physically assault them can\nbackfire, and they display heightened aggression to their peers or to\nwomen in the context of civilian life (132). May argues that the male\nvalues protected by these military institutions are ones that have\nhistorically produced hatred and abuse toward women (121). Not only in\nthe military, but in civilian life, male aggression is channeled in\nways that are not necessarily respectful of women, such as intense\npursuit of protection and support for family. This\n\u201cbreadwinner\u201d role is often linked with a view of men as\ndominant over women in family life (133). In another article, May\nargues that practices like sexual harassment promote male solidarity\nthat keeps women in an inferior position and excludes them from full\nand equal participation (1998a, 105). Posting a Playboy centerfold in\na common area of a workplace contributes to a form of male bonding\nthat makes females feel unwelcome; it is a signal to any woman who\nenters the room that women are to be viewed as comparable to the woman\nin the picture, not welcome in this location as an equal to men. She\nis excluded for the reason that she is a woman, not for any\nidiosyncratic reason (1998a, 106). Women\u2019s exclusion builds male\nsolidarity. The same kind of bonding and exclusion may go on in the\nprofessions, especially ones where women are currently significantly\nunderrepresented (see Kaufman 1999, 199\u2013201; Valian,1999;\nSuperson 2002). These forms of socialization and practices at least\npartly explain why some members of the dominant group men develop\nsexist characters or act in sexist ways.\n\nFeminists have also attempted to explain what it is about a\nperson\u2019s motivations or attitudes that prompt him to engage in\nsexist behavior. Several feminists writing about various explicitly\nsexist behaviors attribute the behaviors to the person\u2019s\nendorsing sexist stereotypes. Kathleen Waits describes the\nwoman-batterer as endorsing traditional sex roles, believing that the\nman should be \u201cthe master\u201d of the house and that it is the\nwoman\u2019s job to satisfy all his needs and wants (1993, 193). The\nbatterer often projects a macho exterior, has a tremendous need to\ndominate and control his wife, and believes that he has the right to\nuse violence against her in order to enforce his will (193). Susan\nGriffin cites studies and social data describing the convicted rapist\nas having, on a statistical average, a normal sexual personality,\ndiffering from the normal, well-adjusted male only in having a greater\ntendency to express violence and rage (1981, 318). The rapist endorses\nstereotypical views about male dominance and female submission, which\nGriffin notes are the same views erotically expressed in the practice\nof heterosexual love in our culture. According to our culture\u2019s\nheterosexual norms, male eroticism is wedded to power, and the man\nmust demonstrate his superior strength with gestures of dominance\nwhich are perceived as amorous (317\u2013318). One reason the courts\nhave had a hard time distinguishing consensual sex from rape is that\nthe same gender stereotypes that are present in \u201cnormal\u201d\nheterosexual sex are present in rape, though in rape they are carried\nto more violent extremes. The practice of female genital mutilation,\nor FGM, also reflects the acceptance of sexist stereotypes about male\ndominance and female submission. Although FGM is typically carried out\nby female relatives or a midwife, the whole society, particularly its\nmale leaders, are the ones who set the social norms. We might think of\nthe women who perform the procedure as vessels through which the real\nproponents of the practice act. Semra Asefa argues that FGM has long\nbeen justified by the belief that women are unable to control their\nown sexuality in the face of their strong desire for sex (1994 and\n1998, 98). The practice of FGM aims to diminish or destroy the\nwoman\u2019s capacity for sexual enjoyment, making her into a\nbreeding machine to perpetuate her husband\u2019s line. Cultures that\npractice FGM often also require domestic confinement as another\nelement of the husband\u2019s control, and include severe punishment\nof women for adultery, while encouraging males to be polygamous\nbecause it is believed that a man\u2019s virility increases\nproportionately with the number of children he has (99). The practice\nof FGM reflects the view that men are dominant in that they control a\nwoman\u2019s capacity to have sex for pleasure and whether she has a\nchoice to have sex with men other than her husband (see Nussbaum\n1999b).\n\nCentral to the stereotypes of male dominance and female submission is\nthe notion that men are superior in worth, and women, inferior. Jean\nHampton offers a feminist analysis of what goes on with the sexist\nimmoralist who targets a person in virtue of her group membership\n(1999). Hampton defines a wrongful action as one that is disrespectful\nof a person\u2019s value, conveying the view that the wrongdoer is\nsuperior in value to his victim. A wife abuser sends the message that\nhis wife has the value of chattel; a rapist conveys the attitude that\nwomen are even lower than chattel, as mere objects to be used whenever\nthe male feels the need to do so (134\u2013135). Indeed, Hampton\nargues, rape harms all women, not just its direct victim, by aiming to\nestablish men\u2019s mastery over women: \u201cAs a woman, you are\nthe kind of human being who is subject to the mastery of people of my\nkind,\u201d and that \u201cYour kind isn\u2019t the equal in worth\nof my kind\u201d (135). Rape, on the Kantian view Hampton favors,\nattempts to lower, or \u201cdiminishes,\u201d the intrinsic value\nall humans have in virtue of being rational and autonomous beings,\nthough Hampton agrees with Kant that a person\u2019s intrinsic value\ncan never actually be lowered. Thus, the motivation of the rapist and\nother sexists who commit wrongful actions against their victims is\nthat they lack respect for women as persons having intrinsic\nvalue.\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe topics in feminist moral psychology are motivated by the feminist\naim to end women\u2019s oppression. Although what unites all\nfeminists is that they share this aim, as we have seen, feminists\ndiffer in their views on how best to accomplish this aim.\nSpecifically, regarding topics in moral psychology, feminists differ\nin their views on the following: the role of emotion in moral theory;\nwhether women have deformed desires and to what extent deformed\ndesires interfere with women\u2019s autonomy; the degree to which\nmembers of the dominant group men are responsible for their\nparticipation in women\u2019s oppression; whether members of the\ndominant group are able to take the perspective of the non-privileged;\nwhether the socialization or background circumstances of members of\nthe subordinate group mitigates their responsibility or\nblameworthiness for immoral action unrelated to oppression; and\nwhether women are responsible for resisting their own oppression. We\nshould not conclude that these differences suggest that feminist\nphilosophical scholarship is so divisive as to not be useful. Rather,\nwe should conclude the opposite, that feminist insights have greatly\nenriched the field of moral psychology by bringing philosophers\u2019\nattention to issues that have been previously ignored or not\nsufficiently examined. The progress feminists have made, and continue\nto make, on these issues is essential to eliminating women\u2019s\noppression.\n",
