    "main_text": "Causation and the Causal Theory of Knowledge || Causation and Knowledge\n6.4 Causation and Knowledge\n\nCognitions that are not memories are classified under two headings:\ntrue and false. If we can find factors invariably preceding\ntrue cognitions, then we will have the beginnings of a causal\ntheory of knowledge. We will be able to say that a cognition is a\nknowledge-episode iff it is (i) true and (ii) preceded by a causal\nfactor which invariably precedes true cognitions (i.e. its truth will\nnot be an accident). The Ny\u0101ya (TS 39) claim to find four, and\nonly four, invariable correlations: perception, inference, comparison,\nand testimony. To each they apply the model of causation outlined\nabove. In particular, they isolate, in each case, a\n\u2018special\u2019 instrumental cause (kara\u1e47a), to\nwhich they give the name \u2018pram\u0101\u1e47a\u2019. In\nthe case of perception, for example, it is the senses. Note that an\ninvariable correlation between two entities, in the sense defined\nabove, does not entail that whenever the first is present, so is the\nsecond\u2014the potter is invariably connected with a pot, but only\ncauses a pot when he is actually \u2018operating\u2019. Similarly, a\npram\u0101\u1e47a, e.g. the eyes, only causes a true\ncognition when it is actually operating. In other words, the\npram\u0101\u1e47a is a necessary but not a sufficient cause\nfor true cognitions. To get a sufficient cause, the Ny\u0101ya (TSD 69\niii) says:\n\nThe causal condition that is \u2018special\u2019 to true cognition\nis called a \u2018gu\u1e47a\u2019 [an epistemic\nexcellence]; the causal condition that is \u2018special\u2019 to\nfalse cognition is called \u2018do\u1e63a\u2019 [an\nepistemic defect]. In the perceptual case, the gu\u1e47a [of\na true cognition \u2018x is F\u2019] is the\nsensory connection with an object [x] possessing a property\n[F], etc.\n\n\nThis is, in effect, the operative condition for true perceptual\ncognitions. Thus, the occurrence of all the usual factors (substrate\ncauses, non-substrate causes, general instrumental causes, etc.)\ntogether with an epistemic excellence (gu\u1e47a) is a\nnecessary and sufficient causal condition for the occurrence of a true\ncognition (see also Philips and Tatacharya 2003).\n",
