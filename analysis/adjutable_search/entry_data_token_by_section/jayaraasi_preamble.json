    "main_text": "\n\nJayar\u0101\u015bi Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, who most likely flourished\nbetween 800\u2013840 probably in Southern India, was an Indian\nphilosopher, a \u2018qualified sceptic\u2019, resorting to a kind of\nmethodological scepticism, affiliated to the materialist\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata school of thought, the author of one\nof most extraordinary philosophical works in India, the\nTattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha (\u2018The Lion of the Dissolution of\n[all] Categories\u2019\u00a0or \u2018The Lion [Destroying] the\nDelusion of Categories\u2019). His main claim is that it is not\npossible to arrive at true knowledge with standard means recognized by\nthe traditionally adopted model of cognitive procedures\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a) in Indian epistemology, because one should first\nproperly define basic criteria of validity for valid cognitive\nprocedures, which is not possible without a prior true knowledge of\nreality against which we could test the procedures for validity etc.\nAs it is traditionally argued, our knowledge of reality and of objects\ndepends on valid cognitive procedures. However, as Jayar\u0101\u015bi\npoints out, all valid cognitive procedures are either fundamentally\nflawed and ultimately unreliable or they require further valid\ncognitive procedures, and these stand in the same need etc. Therefore,\nwithin the traditional epistemological model, we can neither formulate\nproper definitions of valid cognitive procedures nor define what\nreality is and what basic categories are. This is at least the case,\nhe claims, with all the cognitive tools and epistemological categories\nwhich are traditionally claimed to be now at our disposal. He has been\ndifferently classified as a sceptic, agnostic or materialist.\n",
