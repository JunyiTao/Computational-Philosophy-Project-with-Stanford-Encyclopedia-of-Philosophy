    "main_text": "Contemporary Debates || Moral Competence\n3.2 Moral Competence\n3.2.1 The Moral Competence Condition on Responsibility\n\nThe possibility that moral competence\u2014the ability to recognize\nand respond to moral considerations\u2014is a condition on moral\nresponsibility has been suggested at several points above\n (\u00a72.2.1,\n \u00a72.2.2,\n \u00a72.3,\n \u00a73.1.1,\n \u00a73.1.2).\n Susan Wolf\u2019s (1987) fictional story of \u201cJoJo\u201d is\none of the best-known illustrations of this proposal. JoJo was raised\nby an evil dictator, and as a result he became the same sort of\nsadistic tyrant that his father was. As an adult, JoJo is happy to be\nthe sort of person that he is, and he is moved by precisely the\ndesires (e.g., to imprison, torture, and execute his subjects) that he\nwants to be moved by. Thus, JoJo fulfills important conditions on\nresponsibility\n (\u00a73.1.1,\n \u00a73.3.3), however, Wolf argues that it may be unfair to hold him\nresponsible for his bad behavior.\n\nJoJo\u2019s upbringing plays an important role in Wolf\u2019s\nargument, but only because it left JoJo unable to fully appreciate the\nwrongfulness of his behavior. Thus, it is JoJo\u2019s impaired moral\ncompetence that does the real excusing work, and similar conclusions\nof non-responsibility should be drawn about all those whom we think\n\u201ccould not help but be mistaken about their [bad] values\u201d,\nif possession of these values impairs their ability to tell right from\nwrong (Wolf 1987: 57).\n\nMany others join Wolf in arguing that impaired moral competence\n(perhaps on account of one\u2019s upbringing or other environmental\nfactors) undermines one\u2019s moral responsibility (Benson 2001,\nDoris & Murphy 2007, Fischer & Ravizza 1998, Fricker 2010,\nLevy 2003, Russell 1995 and 2004, Wallace 1996, Watson 1987 [2004]).\nPart of what motivates this conclusion is the thought that it can be\nunreasonable to expect morally-impaired agents to avoid wrongful\nbehavior, and that it is therefore unfair to expose these agents to\nthe harm of moral blame on account of their wrongdoing. For detailed\ndevelopment of the moral competence requirement on responsibility in\nterms of considerations of fairness, see R. Jay Wallace (1996); also\nsee Erin Kelly (2013), Neil Levy (2009), and Gary Watson (1987\n[2004]). For rejection of the claim that blame is unfair in the case\nof the morally-impaired agent, see several of the defenders of\nattributionism mentioned in\n \u00a73.1.2\n (particularly Hieronymi 2004, Scanlon 1998, and Talbert 2012)\n\nThe moral competence condition on responsibility can also be motivated\nby the suggestion that impaired agents are not able to commit wrongs\nthat have the sort of moral significance to which blame would be an\nappropriate response. The basic idea here is that, while\nmorally-impaired agents can fail to show appropriate respect for\nothers, these failures do not necessarily constitute the kind of\nflouting of moral norms that grounds blame (Watson 1987 [2004: 234]).\nIn other words, a failure to respect others, is not always an\ninstance of blame-grounding disrespect for others, since the\nlatter (but not the former) requires the ability to comprehend the\nnorms that one violates (Levy 2007, Shoemaker 2011).\n3.2.2 Conversational Approaches to Responsibility\n\nConsiderations about moral competence play an important role in the\nrecent trend of conversational theories of responsibility,\nwhich construe elements of our responsibility practices as\nmorally-expressive moves in an ongoing moral conversation. The thought\nhere is that to fruitfully (and fully) participate in such a\nconversation, one must have some degree of competence in the (moral)\nlanguage of that conversation.\n\nSeveral prominent versions of the conversational approach develop P.\nF. Strawson\u2019s suggestion\n (\u00a72.2.1)\n that the negative reactive attitudes involved in blame are\nexpressions of a demand for moral regard from other agents.\nGary Watson argues that a demand \u201cpresumes\u201d, as a\ncondition on the intelligibility of expressing it,\n\u201cunderstanding on the part of the object of the demand\u201d\n(1987 [2004: 230]). Therefore, since, \u201c[t]he reactive attitudes\nare incipiently forms of communication\u201d, they are intelligibly\nexpressed \u201conly on the assumption that the other can comprehend\nthe message\u201d, and since the message is a moral one,\n\u201cblaming and praising those with diminished moral understanding\nloses its \u2018point,\u2019\u201d at least in a certain sense\n(Watson 1987 [2004: 230]; see Watson 2011 for a modification of this\nproposal). R. Jay Wallace argues, similarly, that since responsibility\npractices are internal to moral relationships that are \n\n\ndefined by the successful exchange of moral criticism and\njustification\u2026. it will be reasonable to hold accountable only\nsomeone who is at least a candidate for this kind of exchange of\ncriticism and justification. (1996: 164)\n\n\nMichael McKenna\u2019s Conversation and Responsibility\n(2012) offers the most developed conversational analysis of\nresponsibility. For McKenna, the \u201cmoral responsibility\nexchange\u201d occurs in stages: an initial \u201cmoral\ncontribution\u201d of morally salient behavior; the \u201cmoral\naddress\u201d of, e.g., blame that responds to the moral\ncontribution; the \u201cmoral account\u201d in which the first\ncontributor responds to moral address with, e.g., apology; and so on\n(2012: 89). Like Wallace and Watson, McKenna notes the way in which a\nmorally impaired agent will find it difficult \u201cto appreciate the\nchallenges put to her by those who hold [her] morally\nresponsible\u201d, but he also argues that a suitably impaired agent\ncannot even make the first move in a moral conversation (2012: 78).\nThus, the morally impaired agent\u2019s responsibility is called into\nquestion not only because she is unable to respond appropriately to\nmoral demands, but also because \u201cshe is incapable of acting from\na will with a moral quality that could be a candidate for assessment\nfrom the standpoint of holding responsible\u201d (McKenna 2012: 78).\nThis point is related to Neil Levy\u2019s and David Shoemaker\u2019s\ncontention, noted in the previous subsection, that impairments of\nmoral competence can leave an agent unable to harbor and express the\ntype of ill will or lack of regard to which blame responds. By\ncontrast, Watson (2011), seems to allow that significant moral\nimpairment is compatible with the ability to perform blame-relevant\nwrongdoing, even if such impairment undermines the wrongdoer\u2019s\nmoral accountability for her actions.\n\nFor another important account of responsibility in broadly\nconversational terms, see Shoemaker\u2019s discussion of the sort of\nmoral anger involved in holding others accountable for their behavior\n(2015a: 87\u2013117). For additional defenses and articulations of\nthe conversational approach to responsibility, see Stephen Darwall\n(2006), Miranda Fricker (2016), and Colleen Macnamara (2015).\n3.2.3 Psychopathy\n\nImpairments of moral competence come in degrees. Susan Wolf\u2019s\nJoJo\n (\u00a73.2.1)\n has localized impairments of the capacity to recognize and respond to\nmoral considerations, but it is not clear that he is entirely immune\nto moral considerations. However, at the far end of the spectrum, we\nencounter more globally and thoroughly impaired figures such as the\npsychopath. In philosophical treatments, the psychopath is typically\npresented as an agent who, while retaining other psychological\ncapacities, is entirely\u2014or as nearly so as\npossible\u2014incapable of responding appropriately to moral\nconsiderations. (This is something of a philosophical construct since\nreal-life psychopathy admits of varying degrees of impairment,\ncorresponding to higher or lower scores on diagnostic measures.)\n\nOne interesting question is whether the psychopath\u2019s\ninability\u2014or at least consistent failure\u2014to respond\nappropriately to moral incentives is primarily the result of a\nmotivational rather than cognitive failure: does the psychopath in\nsome way know what morality requires and simply not care? If a\npositive answer is given to this last question (Fischer & Ravizza\n1998: 76\u201381; Nichols 2002), then it seems likely that the\npsychopath could be responsible for at least some of his bad behavior.\nAnd some have argued that even if psychopathy is primarily a cognitive\nimpairment, it may still be the case that psychopaths possess a\nsufficient capacity for distinguishing right and wrong\u2014or that\nthey possess sufficient related capacities\u2014to be held\nresponsible, at least to some extent and in certain ways (Glannon\n1997, Greenspan 2003, Maibom 2008, Shoemaker 2014, Vargas &\nNichols 2007). On the other hand, many believe that the\npsychopath\u2019s capacity for grasping moral considerations is too\nsuperficial to sustain responsibility (Kennett 2019; Levy 2007; Nelkin\n2015; Wallace 1996: 177\u201378; Watson 2011; see Mason 2017 for the\nclaim that the relevant deficiency is one of moral knowledge rather\nthan moral capacity). And still others have argued that even those who\nare fully impaired for moral understanding are open to blame as long\nas they possess broader rational competencies (Scanlon 1998:\n287\u2013290; Talbert 2014). However, the psychopath\u2019s\npossession of these broader competencies has been called into question\n(Fine & Kennett 2004, Greenspan 2003, Litton 2010).\n3.3 Skepticism and Related Topics \n\nThis section introduces contemporary skepticism about moral\nresponsibility by way of discussions of several topics that have broad\nrelevance for thinking about responsibility.\n\nIf moral responsibility requires free will, and free will involves\naccess to alternatives in a way that is not compatible with\ndeterminism, then it would follow from the truth of determinism that\nno one is ever morally responsible. The above reasoning, and the\nskeptical conclusion it reaches, is endorsed by the hard\ndeterminist perspective on free will and responsibility, which\nwas defended historically by Spinoza and d\u2019Holbach (among\nothers) and, more recently, by Ted Honderich (2002). But given that\ndeterminism may well be false, contemporary skeptics about moral\nresponsibility more often pursue a hard incompatibilist line\nof argument according to which the kind of free will required for\ndesert-based (as opposed to forward-looking, see\n \u00a72.1)\n moral responsibility is incompatible with the truth or\nfalsity of determinism (Pereboom 2001, 2014). The skeptical\npositions discussed below are generally of this sort: the skeptical\nconclusions they advocate do not depend on the truth of\ndeterminism.\n3.3.1 Moral Luck\n\nAccording to Thomas Nagel, a person is subject to moral luck if\nfactors that are not under that person\u2019s control affect the\nmoral assessments to which he is open (Nagel 1976 [1979]; also see\nWilliams 1976 [1981] and the\n entry on moral luck.)\n \n\nIs there such a thing as moral luck? More specifically, can luck\naffect a person\u2019s moral responsibility? Consider a would-be\nassassin who shoots at her target, aiming to kill, but fails to do so\nonly because her bullet is deflected by a passing bird. It seems that\nsuch a would-be assassin has good moral outcome luck (that\nis, good moral luck in the outcome of her behavior). Because of\nfactors beyond her control, the would-be assassin\u2019s moral record\nis better than it would have been: in particular, she is not a killer\nand is not morally responsible for causing anyone\u2019s death. One\nmight think, in addition, that the would-be assassin is less\nblameworthy than a successful assassin with whom she is otherwise\nidentical, and that the reason for this is just that the successful\nassassin intentionally killed someone while the unsuccessful assassin\n(as a result of good moral luck) did not. (For important recent\ndefenses of moral luck, see Hanna 2014 and Hartman 2017.) \n\nOn the other hand, one might think that if the two assassins just\nmentioned are identical in terms of their values, goals, intentions,\nand motivations, then the addition of a bit of luck to the\nunsuccessful assassin\u2019s story cannot ground a deep contrast\nbetween these two agents in terms of their moral responsibility. One\nway to sustain this position is to argue that moral responsibility is\na function solely of internal features of agents, such as their\nmotives and intentions (Khoury 2018; also see Enoch & Marmor 2007\nfor some of the main arguments against moral luck). Of course, the\nsuccessful assassin is responsible for something (killing a\nperson) for which the unsuccessful assassin is not, but it might be\npossible to argue that both are morally responsible\u2014and\npresumably blameworthy\u2014to the same degree insofar as it\nwas true of both of them that they aimed to kill, and that they did so\nfor the same reasons and with the same degree of commitment toward\nbringing about that outcome (see M. Zimmerman 2002 and 2015 for this\ninfluential perspective). \n\nBut now consider a different would-be assassin who does not even try\nto kill anyone, but only because his circumstances did not favor this\noption. This would-be assassin is willing to kill under\nfavorable circumstances (and so he may seem to have had good\ncircumstantial moral luck since he was not in those\ncircumstances). Perhaps the degree of responsibility attributed to the\nsuccessful and unsuccessful assassins described above depends not so\nmuch on the fact that they both tried to kill as on the fact that they\nwere both willing to kill; in this case, the would-be assassin just\nintroduced may share their degree of responsibility since he shares\ntheir willingness to kill. But an account that focuses on how agents\nwould be willing to act under counterfactual circumstances is likely\nto generate unintuitive conclusions about responsibility since many\nagents who are typically judged blameless might willingly perform\nterrible actions under the right circumstances. (M. Zimmerman 2002 and\n2015 does not shy away from this consequence, but criticisms of his\nefforts to reject moral luck\u2014Hanna 2014, Hartman 2017\u2014have\nmade much of it; see Peels 2015 for a position that is related to\nZimmerman\u2019s but that may avoid the unintuitive consequence just\nmentioned.) \n\nAnother approach to luck holds that it is inimical to moral\nresponsibility in a way that generally undermines responsibility\nascriptions. To see the motivation for this skeptical position,\nconsider constitutive moral luck: that is, luck in how one is\nconstituted in terms of the \u201cinclinations, capacities, and\ntemperament\u201d one finds within oneself (Nagel 1976 [1979: 28]).\nFacts about a person\u2019s inclinations, capacities, and temperament\nexplain much\u2014if not all\u2014of that person\u2019s behavior,\nand if the facts that explain why a person acts as she does are a\nresult of good or bad luck, then perhaps it is unfair to hold her\nresponsible for that behavior. As Nagel notes, once the full sweep of\nthe various kinds of luck comes into view, \u201c[t]he area of\ngenuine agency\u201d may seem to shrink to nothing since our actions\nand their consequences \u201cresult from the combined influence of\nfactors, antecedent and posterior to action, that are not within the\nagent\u2019s control\u201d (1976 [1979: 35]). If this is right, then\nperhaps, \n\n\nnothing remains which can be ascribed to the responsible self, and we\nare left with nothing but a\u2026sequence of events, which can be\ndeplored or celebrated, but not blamed or praised. (Nagel 1976 [1979:\n37]) \n\n\nThe above quotations notwithstanding, Nagel himself doesn\u2019t\nfully embrace a skeptical conclusion about responsibility on grounds\nof moral luck, but others have done so, most notably, Neil Levy\n(2011). According to Levy\u2019s \u201chard luck view\u201d, the\nencompassing nature of moral luck means \u201cthat there are no\ndesert-entailing differences between moral agents\u201d (2011: 10).\nOf course, there are differences between agents in terms of their\ncharacters and the good or bad actions and outcomes that they produce,\nbut Levy\u2019s point is that, given the influence of luck in\ngenerating these differences, they don\u2019t provide a sound basis\nfor differential treatment of people in terms of moral praise and\nblame. (See Russell 2017 for a compatibilist account that is led to a\nvariety of pessimism, though not skepticism, on the basis of the\nconcerns about moral luck just described.)\n3.3.2 Ultimate Responsibility\n\nAnother important skeptical argument\u2014related to the observations\nabout constitutive moral luck in the previous subsection\u2014is\nGalen Strawson\u2019s Basic Argument, which concludes that \u201cwe\ncannot be truly or ultimately morally responsible for our\nactions\u201d (1994: 5). (Since the argument targets\n\u201cultimate\u201d moral responsibility, it does not necessarily\nexclude other forms, such as forward-looking responsibility\n (\u00a72.1)\n and, on some understandings, responsibility-as-attributability\n (\u00a73.1.1).)\n The argument begins by noting that an agent makes the choices she\ndoes because of certain facts about the way she is: for example, the\nfacts about what seems choiceworthy to her. But if this is true, then,\nin order to be responsible for her subsequent choices, perhaps an\nagent also needs to be responsible for the facts about what seems\nchoiceworthy to her. But how can one be responsible for these prior\nfacts about herself? Wouldn\u2019t this require a prior choice on the\npart of the agent, one that resulted in her present dispositions to\nsee certain ends and means as choiceworthy? But this prior choice\nwould itself be something for which the agent is responsible only if\nthe agent is also responsible for the fact that that prior\nchoice seemed choiceworthy to her. And now we must explain how the\nagent can be responsible for this additional prior fact about herself,\nwhich will require positing another choice by the agent, and the\nresponsibility for that choice will also have to be secured, which\nwill require explaining why it seemed choiceworthy to her, and so on.\nA regress looms here, and Strawson claims that it cannot be stopped\nexcept by positing an initial act of self-creation on the responsible\nagent\u2019s part (1994: 5, 15). Only self-creating agents could be\nfully responsible for their own tendencies to exercise their powers of\nchoice as they do, but self-creation is impossible, so no one is every\ntruly or ultimately morally responsible for their behavior.\n\nA number of replies to this argument (and the argument from\nconstitutive moral luck) are possible. One might simply deny that\nhow a person came to be the way she is matters for present\nresponsibility: perhaps all we need to know in order to judge a\nperson\u2019s present responsibility are facts about her present\nconstitution and about how that constitution is related to the\nperson\u2019s present behavior. (For views like this, see the\ndiscussion of attributionism\n (\u00a73.1.2)\n and the discussion of non-historical accounts of responsibility in\nthe next subsection). Alternatively, one might think that while\npersonal history matters for moral responsibility, Strawson\u2019s\nargument sets the bar too high, requiring too much historical\ncontrol over one\u2019s constitution (see Fischer 2006; for a reply,\nsee Levy 2011: 5). Perhaps what is needed is not literal\nself-creation, but simply an ability to enact changes in oneself so as\nto acquire responsibility for the self that results from these changes\n(Clarke 2005). A picture along these lines can be found in\nAristotle\u2019s suggestion that one can be responsible for being a\ncareless person if one\u2019s present state of carelessness is the\nresult of earlier choices that one made (Aristotle, Nicomachean\nEthics; see also Michele Moody-Adams 1990).\n\nRoughly in this Aristotelian vein, Robert Kane offers a detailed\nincompatibilist account of how we can secure ultimate responsibility\nfor our actions (1996 and 2007). On Kane\u2019s view, for an agent\n\n\n\nto be ultimately responsible for [a] choice, the agent must\nbe at least in part responsible by virtue of choices or actions\nvoluntarily performed in the past for having the character and motives\nhe or she now has. (2007: 14; emphasis in original) \n\n\nThis position may appear to be open to the regress concerns presented\nin Galen Strawson\u2019s argument above. But Kane thinks a regress is\navoided in cases in which a person\u2019s character-forming choices\nare undetermined. Since these undetermined choices will have no\nsufficient causes, there is no relevant prior cause for which\nthe agent must be responsible, so there is no regress problem (Kane\n2007: 15\u201316; see Pereboom 2001: 47\u201350 for criticism of\nKane on this point.)\n\nOf particular interest to Kane are potential character-forming choices\nthat occur \u201cwhen we are torn between competing visions of what\nwe should do or become\u201d (2007: 26). In such cases, if a person\nsees reasons in favor of either choice that he might make, and the\nchoice that he makes is undetermined, then whichever choice he makes\nwill have been chosen for his own reasons. According to Kane, when an\nagent makes this kind of choice, he shapes his character, and since\nhis choice is not determined by prior causal factors, he is\nresponsible for it and for the character it shapes and for the\ncharacter-determined choices that he makes in the future.\n\nKane\u2019s approach is an important instance of those\nincompatibilist theories that attempt to explain how free will, while\nrequiring indeterminism, could clearly be at home in the natural world\nas we know it (also see Balaguer 2010, Ekstrom 2000, and Franklin\n2018). (This is as opposed to agent-causal accounts of free\nwill\u2014Chisholm 1964, O\u2019Connor 2000\u2014that invoke a type\nof causal power that is less easily naturalized). However, many have\nargued that any account like Kane\u2019s, which inserts an\nindeterministic link in the causal chain leading to action, actually\nreduces an agent\u2019s control over an action or at least leaves it\nunclear why such an insertion would increase agential control over\nactions as compared to a deterministic story of action (Hobart 1934;\nLevy 2011: 41\u201383; Pereboom 2014: 31\u201349; van Inwagen 1983:\n126\u201352; Watson 1999).\n3.3.3 Personal History and Manipulation\n\nAccounts such as Neil Levy\u2019s (2011) and Galen Strawson\u2019s\n(1994), described in the two preceding subsections, assume that the\nfacts about the way a person came to be the way she is are relevant\nfor determining her present responsibility. But non-historical views,\nsuch as attributionism\n (\u00a73.1.2)\n and the views that Susan Wolf calls \u201cReal Self\u201d theories\n (\u00a73.1.1),\n reject this contention. Real Self accounts are sometimes referred to\nas \u201cstructural\u201d or \u201chierarchical\u201d theories,\nand John M. Fischer and Mark Ravizza (1998: 184\u2013187) have called\nthem \u201cmesh\u201d theories. By whatever name, the basic idea is\nthat an agent is morally responsible insofar as her will has the right\nsort of structure: in particular, there needs to be a mesh or fit\nbetween the desires that actually move the agent and her values, or\nbetween the desires that move her and her higher-order desires, the\nlatter of which are the agent\u2019s reflective preferences about\nwhich desires should move her. (For approaches along these lines, see\nDworkin 1970; Frankfurt\n1971, 1987; Neely 1974; and Watson 1975.)\n\nHarry Frankfurt\u2019s comparison between a willing drug addict and\nan unwilling addict illustrates important features of his version of\nthe structural approach to responsibility. Both of Frankfurt\u2019s\naddicts have desires to take the drug to which they are addicted, and\nthe nature of their addictions is such that both addicts will\nultimately act to fulfill their first-order addictive desire. But\nsuppose that both addicts are capable of taking higher-order\nperspectives on their first-order desires, and suppose that they take\ndifferent higher-order perspectives. The willing addict\nendorses and identifies with his addictive desire. The unwilling\naddict, on the other hand, repudiates his addictive desire to such an\nextent that, when it ends up being effective, Frankfurt says that this\naddict is \u201chelplessly violated by his own desires\u201d (1971:\n12). The willing addict has a kind of freedom that the unwilling\naddict lacks: they may both be bound to take the drug to which they\nare addicted, but insofar as the willing addict is moved by a desire\nthat he endorses, he acts freely in a way that the unwilling addict\ndoes not (Frankfurt 1971: 19). A related conclusion about\nresponsibility may be drawn: perhaps the unwilling addict\u2019s\ndesire is alien to him in such a way that his responsibility for\nacting on it is called into question (for a recent defense of this\nconclusion, see Sripada 2017). \n\nOne objection to Frankfurt\u2019s view goes like this. His account\nseems to assume that the addicts\u2019 higher-order desires have the\nauthority to speak for them\u2014they reveal (or constitute) the\nagent\u2019s \u201creal self\u201d, to use Wolf\u2019s language\n(1990). But if higher-order desires are invoked out of a concern that\nan agent\u2019s first-order desires may not stem from his real self,\nwhy won\u2019t the same worry recur with respect to higher-order\ndesires as well? In other words, when ascending through the orders of\ndesires, why stop at any particular point, why not think that appeal\nto a still higher order is always necessary to reveal where an agent\nstands? (See Watson (1975) for an objection along these lines, which\npartly motivates Watson\u2014in his articulation of a structural\napproach\u2014to focus on whether an agent\u2019s desires conform\nwith her values, rather than with her higher-order\ndesires).\n\nAnd even if one agrees with Frankfurt (or Watson) about the structural\nelements required for responsibility, one might wonder how an\nagent\u2019s will came to have its particular structure. Thus, an\nimportant type of objection to Frankfurt\u2019s view notes that the\nrelevant structure might have been put in place by factors that\nintuitively undermine responsibility, in which case the presence of\nthe relevant structure is not itself sufficient for responsibility\n(Fischer & Ravizza 1998: 196\u2013201; Locke 1975; Slote 1980).\nFischer and Ravizza argue that \n\n\n[i]f the mesh [between higher- and lower-order desires] were produced\nby\u2026brainwashing or subliminal advertising\u2026we would not\nhold the agent morally responsible for his behavior \n\n\nbecause the psychological mechanism that produced the behavior would\nnot be, \u201cin an important intuitive sense, the agent\u2019s\nown\u201d (1998: 197; emphasis in original). In response to this\ntype of worry, Fischer and Ravizza argue that responsibility has an\nimportant historical component, which they attempt to capture with\ntheir account of how agents can \u201ctake responsibility\u201d for\nthe psychological mechanisms that produces their behavior (1998:\n207\u2013239). (For criticism of Fischer and Ravizza\u2019s account\nof taking responsibility, see Levy 2011: 103\u2013106 and Pereboom\n2001: 120\u201322; for quite different accounts of taking\nresponsibility, see Enoch 2012; Mason 2019: 179\u2013207; and Wolf\n2001. For work on the general significance of personal histories for\nresponsibility, see Christman 1991, Vargas 2006, and D. Zimmerman\n2003.)\n\nPart of Fischer and Ravizza\u2019s motivation for developing their\naccount of \u201ctaking responsibility\u201d was to ensure that\nagents who have been manipulated in certain ways do not turn out to be\nresponsible on their view. Several examples and arguments featuring\nthe sort of manipulation that worried Fischer and Ravizza have played\nimportant roles in the recent literature on responsibility. One of\nthese is Alfred Mele\u2019s Beth/Ann example (1995, 2006b), which\nemphasizes the difficulties faced by accounts of responsibility that\neschew historical conditions. In the example, Ann has acquired her\npreferences and values in the normal way, but Beth is manipulated by a\nteam of neuroscientists so that she now has preferences and values\nthat are identical to Ann\u2019s. After the manipulation, Beth is\ncapable of reflecting on her new values, and when she does so, she\nendorses them enthusiastically. But whereas we might normally take\nsuch an endorsement to be a sign of the sort of self-governance\nassociated with responsibility, Mele suggests that Beth, unlike Ann,\nexhibits merely \u201cersatz self-government\u201d since\nBeth\u2019s new values where imposed on her (1995: 155). And if\ncertain kinds of personal histories similarly undermine an\nagent\u2019s ability to genuinely or authentically govern her\nbehavior, then agents with these histories will not be morally\nresponsible. (For replies to Mele and general insights into\nmanipulation cases, see Arpaly 2003, King 2013, McKenna 2004, and Todd\n2011; for discussion of issues about personal identity that arise in\nmanipulation cases, see Khoury 2013, Matheson 2014, Shoemaker\n2012)\n\nNow one can take a hard line in Beth\u2019s case (McKenna 2004). Such\na stance might involve noting that while Beth acquired her new values\nin a strange way (and in a way that involved moral wrongs done to\nher), everyone acquires their values in ways that are not\nfully under their control. Indeed, following Galen Strawson\u2019s\nline of argument (1994), described in\n \u00a73.3.2,\n it might be noted that no one has ultimate control over\ntheir values, and even if normal agents have some capacity to address\nand alter their values, the dispositional factors that govern how this\ncapacity is used are ultimately the result of factors beyond\nagents\u2019 control. So perhaps it is not as clear as it might first\nappear that Beth is distinguished from normal agents in terms of her\npowers of self-governance and her moral responsibility for her\nbehavior. But this reasoning can cut both ways: instead of showing\nthat Beth is assimilated into the class of normal, responsible agents,\nit might show that normal agents are assimilated into the class of\nnon-responsible agents like Beth. Derk Pereboom\u2019s four-case\nargument employs a maneuver along these lines (1995, 2001, 2007,\n2014).\n\nPereboom\u2019s argument presents Professor Plum in four different\nscenarios. In each scenario, Plum kills Ms. White while satisfying the\nconditions on desert-involving moral responsibility most often\nproposed by compatibilists (and described in earlier sections of this\nentry): Plum kills White because he wants to, and while this desire is\nin keeping with Plum\u2019s character, it is not irresistible; Plum\nalso endorses his desire to kill White from a higher-order volitional\nperspective; finally, Plum is generally morally competent, and the\nprocess of deliberation that leads to his decision to kill White is\nappropriately responsive to reasons.\n\nIn Case 1, Plum is \u201ccreated by neuroscientists,\nwho\u2026manipulate him directly through the use of radio-like\ntechnology\u201d (Pereboom 2001: 112). These scientists cause\nPlum\u2019s reasoning to take a certain (reasons-responsive) path\nthat culminates in Plum concluding that the self-serving reasons in\nfavor of killing White outweigh the reasons in favor of not doing so.\nPereboom believes that in such a case Plum is clearly not responsible\nfor killing White since his behavior was determined by the actions of\nthe neuroscientists. In Cases 2 and 3, Plum is causally determined to\nundertake the same reasoning process as in Case 1, but in Case 2 Plum\nis merely programmed to do so by neuroscientists (rather than having\nbeen created by them), and in Case 3 Plum\u2019s reasoning is the\nresult of socio-cultural influences that determine his character. In\nCase 4, Plum is just a normal human being in a causally deterministic\nuniverse, and he decides to kill White in the same way as in the\nprevious cases.\n\nPereboom claims that there is no relevant difference between Cases 1,\n2, and 3 such that our judgments about Plum\u2019s responsibility\nshould be different in these three cases. Furthermore, the reason that\nPlum is not responsible in these cases seems to be that, in each case,\nhis behavior is causally determined by forces beyond his control\n(Pereboom 2001: 116). But then we should conclude that Plum is not\nresponsible in Case 4 (since causal determinism is the defining\nfeature of that case). And since, in Case 4, Plum is just a normal\nhuman being in a causally deterministic universe, the conclusion we\ndraw about him should extend to all other normal persons in causally\ndeterministic universes. (For an important, related manipulation\nargument, see Mele\u2019s \u201czygote argument\u201d in Mele 1995,\n2006b, and 2008.)\n\nPereboom\u2019s argument has inspired a number of objections. For\nexample, it could be argued that in Case 1, the manipulation to which\nPlum is subject undermines his responsibility for some reason besides\nthe fact that the manipulation causally determines his behavior, which\nwould stop the generalization from Case 1 to the subsequent cases\n(Fischer 2004, Mele 2005, Demetriou 2010; for a response to this line\nof argument, see Matheson 2016; Pereboom addresses this concern in his\n2014 presentation of the argument; also see Shabo 2010).\nAlternatively, it might be argued, on compatibilist grounds, that Plum\nis responsible in Case 4, and this conclusion might be extended to the\nearlier cases since Plum fulfills the same compatibilist-friendly\nconditions on responsibility in those cases (McKenna 2008).\n\nThe four-case argument attempts to show that if determinism is true,\nthen we cannot be the sources of our actions in the way required for\nmoral responsibility. It is, therefore, an argument for\nincompatibilism rather than for skepticism about moral responsibility.\nBut, in combination with Pereboom\u2019s argument that we lack the\nsort of free will required for responsibility even if determinism is\nfalse (2001: 38\u201388; 2014: 30\u201370), the four-case argument\nhas emerged as an important part of a detailed and influential\nskeptical perspective. For other skeptical accounts, see Caruso\n(2016), Smilansky (2000),\nWaller (2011); also see the\n entry on skepticism about moral responsibility.\n3.3.4 The Epistemic Condition on Responsibility\n\nThere has been a recent surge in interest in the epistemic, or\nknowledge, condition on responsibility (as opposed to the freedom or\ncontrol condition that is at the center of the free will debate). In\nthis context, the following epistemic argument for skepticism about\nresponsibility has been developed. (In certain structural respects,\nthe argument resembles Galen Strawson\u2019s skeptical argument\ndiscussed in\n \u00a73.3.2.)\n\nSometimes agents act in ignorance of the likely bad consequences of\ntheir actions, and sometimes their ignorance excuses them from blame\nfor so acting. But in other cases, an agent\u2019s ignorance might\nnot excuse him. How can we distinguish the cases where ignorance\nexcuses from those in which it does not? One proposal is that\nignorance fails to excuse when the ignorance is itself something for\nwhich an agent might be blamed. And one proposal for when ignorance is\nblameworthy is that it issues from a blameworthy benighting\nact in which an agent culpably impairs, or fails to improve, his own\nepistemic position (H. Smith 1983). In such a case, the agent\u2019s\nignorance seems to be his own fault, so it cannot be appealed to in\norder to excuse the agent.\n\nBut when is a benighting act blameworthy? Several philosophers have\nsuggested that we are culpable for benighting acts only when we engage\nin them knowing that we are doing so and knowing that we should not do\nso (Levy 2011, Rosen 2004, M. Zimmerman 1997). Ultimately, the\nsuggestion is that ignorance for which one is blameworthy, and that\nleads to blameworthy unwitting wrongdoing, has its source in\nknowing wrongful behavior. Thus, if someone unwittingly does\nsomething wrong, then that person will be blameworthy only if we can\nexplain his lack of knowledge (his \u201cunwittingness\u201d) by\nreference to something else that he knowingly did wrong.\n\nConsider an example from Gideon Rosen (2004) in which a surgeon orders\nher patient to be transfused with the wrong type of blood, and suppose\nthat the surgeon was unaware that she was making this mistake.\nAccording to Rosen, the surgeon will be blameworthy for harming her\npatient only if she is blameworthy for being ignorant about the\npatient\u2019s blood type when she requests the transfusion, and she\nwill be blameworthy for this only if her ignorance stems from some\ninstance in which the surgeon knowingly failed to do something that\nshe ought to have done to avoid her later ignorance. It won\u2019t,\nfor example, be enough that the surgeon\u2019s ignorance is explained\nby her failure to doublecheck the patient\u2019s medical records. In\norder to ground blame, this omission on the surgeon\u2019s part must\nitself have been culpable, which requires that the surgeon knew that\nthis omission was wrong. And if the surgeon wasn\u2019t aware that\nshe was committing a wrongful omission (when she failed to doublecheck\nher patient\u2019s medical records), then this failure of\nknowledge on the surgeon\u2019s part must be explained by some prior\nculpable\u2014that is, knowing\u2014act or omission. In the end, for\nRosen, \n\n\nthe only possible locus of original responsibility [for a\nlater unwitting act] is an akratic act\u2026. a knowing\nsin. (2004: 307; emphasis in original) \n\n\nSimilarly, Michael Zimmerman argues that \n\n\nall culpability can be traced to culpability that involves lack of\nignorance, that is, that involves a belief on the agent\u2019s part\nthat he or she is doing something morally wrong. (1997: 418)\n\n\nThe above reasoning may apply not just to cases in which a person is\nunaware of the consequences of her action, but also to cases in which\na person is unaware of the moral status of her behavior. A slaveowner,\nfor example, might think that slaveholding is permissible, and so, on\nthe account considered here, he will be blameworthy only if he is\nculpable for his ignorance about the moral status of slavery, which\nwill require, for example, that he ignored evidence about its moral\nstatus while knowing that this is something he should not do (Rosen\n2003 and 2004).\n\nThese reflections can give rise to a couple forms of skepticism about\nmoral responsibility (and particularly about blameworthiness). First,\nwe might come to endorse a form of epistemic skepticism on the grounds\nthat we rarely have insight into whether a wrongdoer was\nakratic\u2014that is, was a knowing wrongdoer\u2014at some suitable\npoint in the etiology of a given action (Rosen 2004). Alternatively,\nor in addition, one might endorse a more substantive form of\nskepticism on the grounds that a great many normal wrongdoers\ndon\u2019t exhibit the sort of knowing wrongdoing supposedly required\nfor responsibility. In other words, perhaps very many wrongdoers\ndon\u2019t know that they are wrongdoers and their ignorance\non this score is not their fault since it doesn\u2019t arise from an\nappropriate earlier instance of knowing wrongdoing. In this case, very\nmany ordinary wrongdoers may fail to be morally responsible for their\nbehavior. (For skeptical suggestions along these lines, see M.\nZimmerman 1997 and Levy 2011.) \n\nThere is more to the epistemic dimension of responsibility than what\nis contained in the above skeptical argument, but the argument does\nbring out a lot of what is of interest in this domain. For one thing,\nit prominently relies on a tracing strategy. This strategy is\nused, for example, in accounts that feature a person who does not, at\nthe time of action, fulfill control or knowledge conditions on\nresponsibility, but who nonetheless seems morally responsible for her\nbehavior. In such a case, the agent\u2019s responsibility may be\ngrounded in the fact that her failure to fulfill certain conditions on\nresponsibility is traceable to earlier actions undertaken by the agent\nwhen she did fulfill these conditions. For example, a person may be so\nintoxicated that she lacks control over, or awareness of, her\nbehavior, and yet it may still be appropriate to hold her responsible\nfor her intoxicated behavior insofar as she freely took steps to\nintoxicate herself. The tracing strategy plays an important role in\nmany accounts of responsibility (see, e.g., Fischer & Ravizza\n1998: 49\u201351), but it has also been subjected to important\ncriticisms (see Vargas 2005; for a reply see Fischer and Tognazzini\n2009; for more on tracing, see Khoury 2012, King 2014, Shabo 2015, and\nTimpe 2011).\n\nVarious strategies for rejecting the above skeptical argument also\nillustrate stances one can take on the relevance of knowledge for\nresponsibility. These strategies typically involve rejecting the claim\nthat knowing wrongdoing is fundamental to blameworthiness. For\nexample, it might be argued that it is often morally reckless to\nperform actions when one is merely uncertain whether they are wrong,\nand that this recklessness is sufficient for blameworthiness (see\nGuerrero 2007; also see Nelkin & Rickless 2017b and Robichaud\n2014). Another strategy would be to argue that blameworthiness can be\ngrounded in cases of morally ignorant wrongdoing if it is reasonable\nto expect the wrongdoer to have avoided her moral ignorance, and\nparticularly if her ignorance is itself caused by the agent\u2019s\nown epistemic and moral vices (FitzPatrick 2008 and 2017). Relatedly,\nit might be argued that one who is unaware that he does wrong is\nblameworthy if he possessed relevant capacities for avoiding his\nfailure of awareness; this approach may be particularly promising in\ncases in which an agent\u2019s lack of moral awareness stems from a\nfailure to remember her moral duties (Clarke 2014, 2017 and\nSher 2006b, 2009; also see\nRudy-Hiller 2017). Finally, it might simply be claimed that morally\nignorant wrongdoers can harbor, and express through their behavior,\nobjectionable attitudes or qualities of will that suffice for\nblameworthiness (Arpaly 2003, Bj\u00f6rnsson 2017, Harman 2011, Mason\n2015, Talbert 2013). This approach may be most promising in cases in\nwhich a wrongdoer is aware of the material outcomes of her conduct but\nunaware of the fact that she does wrong in bringing about those\noutcomes.\n\nFor more, see the\n entry on the epistemic condition for moral responsibility.",
