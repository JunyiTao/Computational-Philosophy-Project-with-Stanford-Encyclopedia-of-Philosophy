    "main_text": "Leibniz on Space and Time || Against Absolute Space and Time\n5.2 Leibnizian Space and Time\n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s positive account of space and time might be thought of as \nresting on two primary pillars and being filled out by a number of \nancillary theses. The first pillar consists in an alternative model, \nor conception, of space and time offered in conscious opposition to \nthe Newtonian conception absolute space and time. According to \nLeibniz, space and time are not so much things in which \nbodies are located and move as systems of relations holding \nbetween things. He thus famously tells Clarke in his Third Paper:\n\n\nAs for my own opinion, I have said more than once, that I hold space \nto be something merely relative, as time is, that I hold it to be an \norder of coexistences, as time is an order of successions. (Third \nPaper, paragraph 4; G VII.363/Alexander 25\u201326)\n\n\nThe main idea is perhaps illustrated more intuitively by a helpful \nexample that Leibniz introduces in his Fifth Paper. There he suggests\nthat space and time are analogous to a family tree. Unlike the \nrelationship between, say, a mighty oak and its leaves, a \ngenealogical tree is not something which exists as a thing \nindependently of, and prior to, its members, but is itself rather \nsomething like an abstract system of relations holding between \nbrothers, sisters, parents, children, aunts, uncles, etc. Analogously\nfor Leibniz, space and time are not to be thought of as containers in\nwhich bodies are literally located and through which they move, but \nrather as an abstract structure of relations in which actual (and \neven possible) bodies might be embedded. \n\n\nThe second pillar of Leibniz\u2019s positive account of space and time is \nrooted in his view that \u2013 even understood as systems of \nrelations \u2013 space and time as \u201cbeings of reason\u201d \nare in a sense at least two steps removed from the monads of his \nmature metaphysics. (i) Although bodies may be held to stand in \nspatial and temporal relations to one another, Leibniz claims, space \nand time themselves must be considered abstractions or idealizations \nwith respect to those relations. For while relations between bodies \nand events are necessarily variable and changing, the relations \nconstituting space and time must be viewed as determinate, fixed, and\nideal. (ii) As we have briefly noted, however, according to Leibniz\u2019s\nmost mature metaphysics, physical bodies and events are themselves to\nbe understood as merely well-founded phenomena. Relations of relative\ndistance and duration holding between bodies must therefore \nthemselves be a step removed from monadic reality, and thus space and\ntime must be, as it were, a second step removed from the most basic \nnon-relational entities of Leibniz\u2019s most mature metaphysics. In \nspite of this double relation holding between ideal space and time on\nthe one hand and monadic reality on the other, Leibniz nonetheless \ninsists that ideal space must be intelligibly related to the various \nperceptions by which monads represent the world, each from its own \n\u201cpoint of view,\u201d just as ideal time must be intelligibly \nrelated to the various appetites in accordance with which monads \nsequentially unfold in synchronized harmony. Although the details of \nthis intelligible grounding story remain less than perspicuous, there\ncan be no doubt that Leibniz saw his relationalism about space and \ntime as dovetailing with the foundations of his monadic metaphysics.\n\n\nBeyond arguing that space and time are ideal systems of relations, \nLeibniz also defends a number of less central theses that help to \nflesh out his positive conceptions of space and time. For our \npurposes it might be worth quickly calling attention to three of the \nmost significant. First, although he takes space and time to be ideal\nsystems of relations, Leibniz nonetheless insists that they are \nconceived of as infinite. In doing so he takes a characteristically \nintermediate position, partially siding with most early moderns in \nrejecting the notion of an imaginary space surrounding a finite \ncosmos, but also partially siding with earlier medieval thinkers in \naffirming that \u201cSince space is itself an ideal thing \u2026 \nspace out of the world must needs be imaginary [but] \u2026 The \ncase is the same with empty space within the world; which I also take\nto be imaginary\u201d (Fifth Paper, paragraph 33; G \nVII.396/Alexander \n 64).[33]\n Second, Leibniz maintains that although the existence of empty space \nis possible \u2013 logically speaking, two bodies could exist at a \nspatial distance with nothing between them \u2013 nonetheless it is \nmorally certain that the actual world is a plenum. For, as we have \nalready noted in connection with his critique of atomism, Leibniz \nmaintains the existence of empty space would be inconsistent with \nGod\u2019s decision to create the best of all possible worlds. Third, in \nspite of his critique of Newton, Leibniz affirms that space and time \nare continuous, homogenous, and infinitely divisible (although not \nactually divided to infinity). He holds that the ascription of such \nproperties to space and time is only possible once they are \nrecognized to be ideal, or \u201cimaginary,\u201d and in this way \nLeibnizian space and time are further distinguished not only from \nNewtonian absolute space and time, but also from extended Leibnizian \nbodies. \n",
