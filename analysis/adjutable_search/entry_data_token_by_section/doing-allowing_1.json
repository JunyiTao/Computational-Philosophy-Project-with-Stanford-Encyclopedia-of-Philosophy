    "main_text": "Distinguishing Distinctions\n2. Distinguishing Distinctions\n\nSuppose some upshot occurs and would not have occurred if the agent\nhad behaved in some different way. The question of whether the agent\ncounts as doing or allowing may be conflated with or distorted by\nquestions that should be kept distinct from it, like the questions of\n(i) whether the agent intended the upshot, (ii) whether she could\neasily have prevented the upshot, (iii) whether she guaranteed the\nupshot or merely made it probable, and even (iv) whether the\nagent\u2019s behavior was morally objectionable. It can easily be\nseen that these do not coincide with the distinction between doing and\nallowing.\n\n(i) Consider the distinction between cases where an agent intends the\nupshot and cases where she does not. If you drive your car into\nsomeone\u2019s body, without realizing it, or because you were trying\nto avoid killing a larger number, and she dies as a result, you\nundoubtedly killed her, even if you did not intend her death.\nConversely, someone may intentionally allow a child to drown in order\nto inherit his fortune.\n\n(ii) It tends to be easier to avoid killing than to avoid letting die,\nbut this is only a tendency. Sometimes saving is easier than not\nkilling. It is easy to throw a life preserver, and it may be difficult\nto refrain from killing someone who is threatening one or who has\ntreated one appallingly. There are even cases where it is physically\ndifficult to avoid killing; as for example, where one has to hold\ntight to a tree to prevent one\u2019s (light) vehicle whose brakes\nhave failed from running into a pedestrian.\n\n(iii) Sometimes the terms \u2018making\u2019 and\n\u2018allowing\u2019 are used to suggest the difference between\nmaking certain and making possible or probable. For example, in\ndiscussions of the problem of evil, people sometimes say, \u201cWell,\nGod didn\u2019t actually make the murder occur. He just allowed it to\noccur.\u201d This is best understood as a distinction between raising\nthe probability of murder to 1 from something less than 1, on the one\nhand, and raising the probability of murder from 0 to something higher\nbut still less than 1. This is a morally significant distinction but\nit is not the distinction between doing and allowing. An agent can\nkill without guaranteeing death. For example, by adding small\nquantities of poison to her victim\u2019s meals she may bring about\nthe death, even though there was a 20% chance that the poison would\nnot kill her. On the other hand, an agent might guarantee the demise\nof a plant by failing to water it in a situation where she is the only\none who can do so.\n\n(iv) Finally, the distinction between doing and allowing harm is\nsometimes thought to have, as part of its conceptual content, a moral\nelement. This thought is rarely made explicit, but the way people are\ninclined to classify cases suggests that they are guided by it. There\nare two main difficulties with this way of drawing the line. Firstly,\nif it is true by definition that killing is worse than letting die,\nthen the question of whether killing is worse than letting die is\nsettled in a trivial, circular, uninteresting way. Secondly, there are\nobvious counterexamples to this crude account\u2014morally appalling\ncases of letting die\u2014failing to feed one\u2019s\nchildren\u2014and morally acceptable cases of killing. We have no\nhesitation talking of killing in self-defense.\n\nA more controversial question is whether the doing/allowing\ndistinction should be distinguished from another related distinction.\nSometimes harms occurs because the agent performed some action:\nbecause she pressed a switch or pushed a rock. Sometimes the harm\noccurs because the agent did not perform some action: because she did\nnot press a switch or did not push a rock. We will refer to this as\nthe action/inaction distinction. There do appear to be cases where the\naction/inaction distinction and the doing/allowing distinction come\napart. An actor might spoil a performance by failing to turn up (doing\nby inaction) (Foot 1978, 26). A potential benefactor might let a\nstarving child die by ringing up her attorney to cancel a direct debit\n(allowing by action) (Bennett 1981, 91). However, the status of these\ncases is a matter of disagreement. The relationship between the\ndoing/allowing distinction and the inaction/inaction distinction will\nbe particularly relevant in discussion of\n \u2018Safety Net\u2019 Cases. \n",
