The duty not to\nharm other people can be extended to a duty not to perform actions\nthat increase their risk of being harmed. However, society as we know\nit is not possible without exceptions to this rule. The determination\nof criteria for such exceptions is problematic in the same way as for\nrights-based theories. All reasonable systems of moral obligations\nwill contain a general prohibition against actions that kill another\nperson. Such a prohibition can (and should) be extended to actions\nthat involve a large risk that a person is killed. However, it cannot\nbe extended to all actions that lead to a minuscule increase in the\nrisk that a person is killed, since that would exclude many actions\nand behaviours that few of us would be willing to give up. A limit\nmust be drawn between reasonable and unreasonable impositions of risk.\nIt seems as if such delimitations will have to appeal to concepts,\nsuch as probabilities and/or the size of the benefits obtained by\ntaking a risk, that are not part of the internal resources of\ndeontological theories.\n",
