    "main_text": "Meinong\u2019s Theory of Objects (1932\u20133)\n2. Meinong\u2019s Theory of Objects (1932\u20133)\n\nFindlay reports that he was won over to realism (i.e., anti-idealism),\nduring his undergraduate years, mainly through clandestine readings of\nRussell and Moore. Reading Russell, he certainly became acquainted\nwith the name and ideas of Alexius Meinong, discussed by Russell at\nlength in 1904 and 1905 (Russell 1904 [1973]). In 1930, after he\nacquired German, Findlay began reading Meinong\u2019s works in\nearnest, under the direction of Meinong\u2019s pupil Ernst Mally.\n\nThe result was the book, Meinong\u2019s Theory of Objects,\npublished by Oxford in 1933, and expanded in 1963 into\nMeinong\u2019s Theory of Objects and Values (M). This book,\nfor decades, was the standard reference work on Meinong in the\nAnglophone world. Given Mally\u2019s imprimatur, we can presume that\nFindlay\u2019s account of Meinong is accurate, but what is more\nrelevant is Findlay\u2019s defense of Meinong against his critics,\nRussell most of all.\n\nThe dispute turned, notoriously, on the status of non-existent\nobjects. For Meinong, there are non-existent objects, they can possess\nproperties, and true things can be said about them. For Russell, there\nare no non-existing objects, they cannot possess properties, and\nnothing true can be said about them. So, for Meinong, it is true the\ngolden mountain is golden, because everything that is F and\nG is F. For Russell, it is false that the golden\nmountain is golden, because there is no such thing as the golden\nmountain to be golden.\n\nRussell dismissed Meinong with a few deft sentences in 1905. If you\nsay that the golden mountain is golden, then you must say that there\nis a golden mountain, that there are chimeras, that there is a present\nKing of France. This offends, Russell later wrote, against our\n\u201crobust sense of reality\u201d. Furthermore, if the golden\nmountain is mountainous and golden, then the round square is both\nround and square, so something exists that is round and square. This\noffends against the law of non-contradiction. Many readers accepted\nthese arguments as decisive. But not Findlay. \n\nTo begin, there is a question as to whether Russell got\nMeinong\u2019s position right. Meinong never maintained that the\nround square existed (or subsisted). On the contrary, it neither\nexists nor subsists, so for Meinong nothing exists that is both round\nand square. But it can be a subject of predication, and if the\npredication is correct, it is a part of a fact, and facts about\ncontradictions are not contradictions. In other words, in terms of\npropositions, Meinong maintained that:\n\n(1) the round square is\nround\n\n\nand\n\n(2) the round square is\nnon-round\n\n\nare both true but denied that from (2) one could infer\n\n(3) not (the round\nsquare is round.)\n\n\nNow (3) contradicts (1) but (2) does not. So we have Meinong\nmaintaining, as a general law, \u201cThe F and G is\nF\u201d, and Russell maintaining, as a general law,\n\u201cNothing can be a subject of predication unless it\nexists\u201d. This seems to pit a logical proposition against a\nmetaphysical one, a win for Meinong. \n\nThe round square inhabits a realm Meinong called Aussersein,\nand Findlay points out that sections of Aussersein can be\ngrouped into compatible entities and consistent propositions (or\nfacts) about them. These correspond, Findlay argues, to the different\ndomains of different possible worlds (M: 58)) That different possible\nworlds can have different domains would become one of Findlay\u2019s\nmajor complaints against Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus and\nits fixed domain of ultimate objects. \n\nThere are, of course, metaphysical issues lurking in the background.\nRussell certainly wanted to make statements that, prima\nfacie, are about non-existents, like the present king of France.\nRussell\u2019s famous trick replaces statements about non-existing\nindividuals with statements about sets of properties that do not\njointly hold of any individual. Findlay believed that Russell\u2019s\nidea was best expressed by Moore in 1918:\n\n\nWe have said that \u2018lions are real\u2019 means that some\nparticular property or other\u2014I will say, for the sake of\nbrevity, the property of being a lion, though that is not strictly\naccurate, does in fact belong to something\u2014that there\nare things that have it, or, to put in another way, that the\nconception of being a lion is a conception which does apply to some\nthings\u2014that there are things that fall under it. And similarly\nwhat \u201cunicorns are unreal\u201d means is that the property of\nbeing a unicorn belongs to nothing. Now, if this is so, then\nit seems to me, in a very important sense, \u2018real\u2019 and\n\u2018unreal\u2019 do not in this usage stand for any conceptions\nare all. The only conceptions which occur in the proposition\n\u2018Lions are real\u2019 are on this interpretation are, plainly\n(1) the conception of being a lion, and (2) the conception of\nbelonging to something, and perfectly obviously \u201creal\u201d\ndoes not stand for either of these. (Moore 1918 [1959: 212]))\n\n\nFindlay disagrees vigorously with this form of metaphysical actualism,\nwhich he describes as an illicit reduction of facts about being to\nfacts about so-being.\n\n\nLet us consider the case of a person who wishes that there were such a\nthing as a philosopher\u2019s stone. If the fact of the existence of\nthe philosopher\u2019s stone is identical with the fact of the\npossession by some object in the universe of the properties of the\nphilosopher\u2019s stone, then we must suppose that the person in\nquestion is really wishing that one or the other of the objects in the\nuniverse should possess the properties of (a) being a stone, and (b)\nturning baser metal into gold. But it is perfectly clear that the man\nmight wish nothing of the kind. He might be perfectly content with all\nthe objects in the universe\u2026 If a childless woman wishes for\nchild, she does not wish to stand in the relation of motherhood to one\nof the children actually in the world, but to another child, which is\nnot in the circumstances an actual child at all, but which would\nbecome an actual child if her wish were fulfilled. It is no doubt true\nthat, if her wish is fulfilled, one of the things actually in the\nworld will be her child, but it is equally true that, while she is\nwishing, she is directing her mind to something which lies beyond the\nactual world, and which will possibly always like beyond it. (M:\n30\u201353-4 )\n\n\nIt is not possible here to follow Findlay\u2019s defense of\nMeinong\u2019s realm of objectives, which includes states of affairs,\nfacts, and other abstract entities that, in Meinong\u2019s\nterminology, subsist rather than exist. Many of Meinong\u2019s\nanalyses predate the classic texts of logical atomism with which they\nshare a common core of analytic concerns, such as the relation between\nstates of affairs and facts. Findlay is even more generous than\nMeinong in describing the population of subsistents:\n\n\nIt is highly arguable that human experience, even at the level of\nperception, is rich in objects that go beyond the concrete existent\nthings of an individualist ontology. The world around us seems to be\nfull of bearings, of suggestions, of half-formed possibilities, of\npin-pointed acts or circumstances, of gaps, vaguenesses, of\ngeneralities, or unrealized limits, and it is of dogma rather than\ndirect experiences that all these higher order things will reduce to\nindividuals and their actual properties. (AE: 29)\n\n\nOn the analytic subjects, to which the most space in the book is\ndevoted, where Russell and Wittgenstein diverge from Meinong, Findlay\nsides with Meinong. But his exposition is not slavish. The realm of\nAussersein has its problems:\n\n\nWe speak of the world of Aussersein, but in reality the\nobjects which have no being do not constitute a world. They are a\nchaos of incoherent fragments\u2026.Between actual existents we can\nalways discover a large number of intimate connections. Beyond the\nboundaries of being no such connections subsist: there is no fixed\ndistance between Valhalla and the islands of the blessed, nor does the\nplanet Vulcan exert a gravitational pull on the star of Bethlehem. (M:\n56)\n\n\nAnd even the famous expansion of the ontology has its problematic\nside:\n\n\nTo do what Meinong does, and merely to set the non-existent, false,\nand absurd alongside the actual and the true, to treat them like the\nwhite and red roses of Russell\u2019s famous\n comparison,[5]\n with nothing to explain the special prerogative of being real or\nbeing the case, is the very type of a dead, surd, and unintelligible\nmode of conception. (M: 342) \n\n\nDespite the doubts expressed here about the realms of Sein\nand Aussersein, Findlay would press them into service in many\nfuture books. To begin, the objects of these realms serve as the\nintentional objects of thought. Second, these realms provide the\nreferents for \u201cvacuous\u201d names in works of fiction. These\nare the opening gambits of the next book, Values and\nIntentions.\n",
