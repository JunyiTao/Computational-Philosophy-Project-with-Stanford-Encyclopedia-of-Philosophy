    "main_text": "Interventions in Philosophy\n5. Topics in Feminism\n\nFeminist critical attention to philosophical practices has revealed\nthe inadequacy of dominant philosophical tropes as well as the need to\nturn philosophical attention to things that had previously gone\nunattended. For example, feminists working from the perspective of\nwomen\u2019s lives have been influential in bringing philosophical\nattention to the phenomenon of care and care-giving (Ruddick 1989;\nHeld 1995, 2007; Hamington 2006), dependency (Kittay 1999), disability\n(Wilkerson 2002; Carlson 2009), women\u2019s labor (Waring 1999;\nDelphy 1984; Harley 2007), the devaluation of women\u2019s\ntestimonies (see the entry on\n feminist epistemology and philosophy of science),\n and scientific bias and objectivity (Longino 1990). In doing so they\nhave revealed weaknesses in existing ethical, political, and\nepistemological theories. More generally, feminists have called for\ninquiry into what are typically considered \u201cprivate\u201d\npractices and personal concerns, such as the family, sexuality, and\nthe body, in order to balance what has seemed to be a masculine\npre-occupation with \u201cpublic\u201d and impersonal matters.\nPhilosophy presupposes interpretive tools for understanding our\neveryday lives; feminist work in articulating additional dimensions of\nexperience and aspects of our practices is invaluable in demonstrating\nthe bias in existing tools, and in the search for better ones.\n\nFeminist explanations of sexism and accounts of sexist practices also\nraise issues that are within the domain of traditional philosophical\ninquiry. For example, in thinking about care, feminists have asked\nquestions about the nature of the self; in thinking about gender,\nfeminists have asked what the relationship is between the natural and\nthe social; in thinking about sexism in science, feminists have asked\nwhat should count as knowledge. In some such cases, mainstream\nphilosophical accounts provide useful tools; in other cases,\nalternative proposals have seemed more promising.\n\nIn the sub-entries included under \u201cfeminism (topics)\u201d in\nthe\n Table of Contents\n to this Encyclopedia, authors survey some of the recent\nfeminist work on a topic, highlighting the issues that are of\nparticular relevance to philosophy. These entries are:\n\nfeminist perspectives on argumentation\nfeminist perspectives on autonomy\nfeminist perspectives on class and work\nfeminist perspectives on disability\nfeminist perspectives on globalization\nfeminist perspectives on objectification\nfeminist perspectives on power\nfeminist perspectives on rape\nfeminist perspectives on reproduction and the family\nfeminist perspectives on science\nfeminist perspectives on sex and gender\nfeminist perspectives on sex markets\nfeminist perspectives on the body\nfeminist perspectives on the self\nfeminist perspectives on trans issues\n\n\nSee also the entries in the\n Related Entries section\n below.\n",
