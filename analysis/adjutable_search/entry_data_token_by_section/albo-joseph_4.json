    "main_text": "The Theory of Principles\n5.  The Theory of Principles\n\n\nAlbo\u2019s theory of principles is the focal point of his book, the\nframework upon which its sections are built, and the element that\ngrants the book its name. Naturally, the academic debate on the theory\nof principles is also quite extensive. Below we will relate to two\naspects of the theory. First we will present the conceptual structure\nof the theory of principles as detailed in the first treatise of\nSefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim, and then we will survey the various\napproaches of the scholarship on this theory.\n\n\nAlbo presents his theory of principles as an alternative to previous\ntheories of principles, especially that of Maimonides. Additionally,\nAlbo openly criticizes his predecessors\u2019 lists of principles. In their\nstead, he proposes a system of fundamental beliefs divided into three\nlevels, which he calls \u201cprinciples,\u201d \u201croots,\u201d\nand \u201cbranches.\u201d The principles are those beliefs that are\nderived necessarily from the term \u201cdivine law.\u201d They are:\n(1) the existence of the divine entity (\u201cexistence of\nGod\u201d); (2) the divine origin of the system of laws (\u201cTorah\nfrom heaven\u201d); and (3) the existence of divine providence,\nexpressed in compensatory reward and punishment for humanity\n(\u201creward and punishment\u201d). From these principles stem\neight \u201croots,\u201d which are beliefs that instill clear and\ndetailed content into the general concept of the principle.  The first\nprinciple, the existence of God, develops into four roots: (1) the\nunity of God, (2) the incorporeality of God, (3) God\u2019s independence of\ntime, (4) God\u2019s lack of deficiencies. The second principle, Torah from\nheaven, leads to three roots: (5) God\u2019s knowledge, (6) prophecy, and\n(7) the genuineness of the divine messenger. The third principle,\nreward and punishment, branches into a single root: (8)\nprovidence. Denial of any of the principles or roots represents a\nheresy of the divine law.\n\n\nThe third category, \u201cbranches,\u201d comprises beliefs that\nAlbo argues are true and that every follower of divine law must\naccept. But in contrast to the first two categories, Albo does not\ndefine refusal to accept the branches as heresy of the divine law, but\nrather only as a sin requiring atonement. Albo lists six beliefs in\nthis category: (1) creation ex nihilo; (2) the supremacy of\nMoses\u2019 prophecy; (3) the eternal nature of the Torah; (4) the\npossibility of obtaining human perfection through the performance of a\nsingle commandment; (5) the resurrection of the dead; (6) the coming\nof the Messiah.\n\n\nEarly scholars of Albo\u2019s work in the late nineteenth and early\ntwentieth centuries argued that Albo\u2019s contribution to the history of\nJewish thought was limited to his theory of principles and the first\ntreatise of his book (Schlesinger 1844, xi\u2013xiv; Back 1869,\n3\u20135, 8\u20139; T\u00e4nzer 1896, 23\u201330). Later scholars\ncalled his theory unoriginal, and identified the philosophical sources\nthat influenced it, especially Maimonides, Ibn Rushd, Nissim of Gerona,\nHasdai Crescas and Simeon ben Zemah Duran (Guttmann 1955,\n170\u2013176; Waxman 1956, 158\u2013161; Schweid 1963; Klein-Braslavi\n1980, 194\u2013197). A subsequent, third scholarly trend attempted to\nclarify the nature of the internal relationship between the categories\nof Albo\u2019s theory of principles (principles, roots, and branches), and\nexamined Albo\u2019s position regarding the concept of heresy (Kellner 1986,\n140\u2013156).\n",
