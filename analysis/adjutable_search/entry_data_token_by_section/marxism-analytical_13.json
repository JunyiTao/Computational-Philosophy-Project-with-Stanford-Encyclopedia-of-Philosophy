    "main_text": "Socialism || Basic Income\n5.3 Basic Income\n\nThe idea of basic income has a long history (early forerunners include\nThomas Spence 1797 [2004] and Joseph Charlier 1848 [2004]), and some\nconfusingly close relatives (including basic endowment and a negative\nincome tax).  Its most recent revival owes much to Philippe Van\nParijs.  The core idea is deceptively simple and seductive. Basic\nincome consists in: \n\n\na regular income paid in cash to every individual member of a society,\nirrespective of income from other sources and with no strings\nattached. (Van Parijs & Vanderborght 2017: 4) \n\n\nThe proposal assumes a territorially defined political community, and\nthat recipients are fiscal residents. The regular payment is in cash\nand not in kind (food, shelter, clothes, etc.). It is paid to each\nindividual, irrespective of their domestic arrangements (not, for\ninstance, only to \u201cheads of households\u201d). It is universal,\ninvolving no means test, but paid, at the same rate, to rich and poor\nalike. And it is an obligation-free payment, carrying no requirement,\nin particular, for beneficiaries to work or be available to work.\n\nBeyond that core idea, particular basic income schemes differ\nconsiderably; not least concerning the level at which the basic income\nis to be paid. To help calibrate alternatives, Van Parijs suggests\nthat an amount corresponding to a quarter of current GDP per\ncapita\u2014which, in 2015, would have corresponded to $1163 per\nmonth in the United States\u2014would sit between\n\u201cmodest\u201d and \u201cgenerous\u201d versions of the\nidea (Van Parijs & Vanderborght 2017: 11).\n\nSince the model apparently assumes an economy dominated by\nappropriately regulated capitalist markets, enthusiasm for a basic\nincome might be thought to sit uneasily with the normative commitments\nof analytical Marxism. One response is to emphasise the ways in which\na basic income scheme might reduce our dependence on that market. It could\nvariously: strengthen the bargaining position of workers (against\ntheir employers and others); effect a partial decommodification of\nlabour power (reducing the economic compulsion to sell the latter);\nand make engagement in socially useful but unpaid activities much\neasier (Wright 2005c). So understood, basic income answers questions\nabout both socialist transition and socialist design; a basic income\nscheme might help us move away from a capitalist society, and form part of the\ninstitutional structure of the non-capitalist alternative.\n\nIn a set of delightfully provocative essays written with Robert van\nder Veen, Van Parijs took that suggestion\u2014that a basic income\nscheme might transform capitalism in a progressive direction\u2014and ran\nwith it (Van der Veen & Van Parijs 1986a, 1986b, 2006). They laid out the\npossibility of \u201ca capitalist road to communism\u201d; arguing\nthat welfare state capitalisms have the potential to move smoothly, if\nslowly, towards Marx\u2019s own communist ideal. The communist\n\u201crealm of freedom\u201d\u2014understood here as involving\nwidespread material abundance, voluntary productive contributions\naccording to ability, and distribution according to need\u2014is now\nreached via the introduction of, and gradual increase in, a basic\nincome scheme in capitalist societies. It is not reached by the traditional\n\u201ctransitional\u201d, or \u201cstrictly socialist\u201d, stage\ninvolving state or social ownership of means of production. On this\naccount, that \u201cstrictly socialist\u201d stage is redundant, and\ncan be skipped entirely (for critical comment, see Wright 1994:\n157\u2013172). \n\nFramed in this way, the case for basic income seems to rest on\ncontroversial perfectionist assumptions; for instance, about the\ndisvalue of wage labour and value of unalienated activities (see\nKandiyali 2022). This might make it a hard sell in liberal\npluralistic societies committed to respecting a diversity of\nconceptions of the good life, and Van Parijs has subsequently sought\nto reposition the proposal.\n\nThe appeal of basic income is now said to rest on its emancipatory\npotential, its ability to deliver \u201creal freedom\u201d\u2014the\n\u201cgenuine capacity\u201d of individuals to act on their own life\nplans free from certain debilitating pressures (including unemployment\nand employment traps)\u2014to all. Freedom considerations also, of\ncourse, play a role in determining the form of basic income;\nfor instance, helping to justify its being a cash payment with no\nrestriction on what is purchased or when. The tightness of the\nconnection between basic income and this real libertarian foundation\nmight be doubted, but this is now Van Parijs\u2019 preferred\ngrounding.\n\nSo understood, basic income rests on a conception of social justice\nwhich is both liberal, in not privileging particular contested\nconceptions of the good, and egalitarian, in requiring justifications\nfor any derivation from a baseline equal distribution. Freedom is\ntreated not as a constraint on what justice requires, but as\n\u201cthe very stuff that justice consists in distributing\nfairly\u201d (Van Parijs & Vanderborght 2017: 104). Basic income\nis justified as a way of maximising the level of real freedom to those\nwith the least of it (\u201cmaximin real freedom\u201d), or rather\n\u201cmaximining\u201d the \u201cgifts\u201d that form the\n\u201cmaterial substratum\u201d of such real freedom.\n\u201cGifts\u201d here refer to the immense stock of wealth for\nwhich none of us are individually responsible, and which should be\ntreated as our common inheritance (Van Parijs & Vanderborght 2017:\n104\u2013109).\n\nCriticisms of basic income are sufficiently many and varied to make\nmeaningful summary impractical. However, two familiar worries might be\nnoted.\n\nFirst, a familiar desirability worry is that basic income involves an\napparent unfairness. In advocating unconditional benefits it violates\nsome conception of \u201creciprocity\u201d, allowing individuals to\nreceive a share of their society\u2019s income without making a\nproductive contribution in return (White 2003). Elster provocatively\ndescribes basic income as a recipe for the \u201cexploitation of the\nindustrious by the lazy\u201d (1986b: 719). A number of responses are\navailable, including: conceding the validity of the concern, but seeing\nit as outweighed by the practical difficulties of enacting\nconditionality; or allowing that reciprocity considerations are\npersuasive in the context of certain cooperative ventures, but denying\ntheir relevance in the context of distributive justice.\n\nSecond, a familiar feasibility worry is that basic income schemes\nmight be unaffordable. In facilitating a move away from paid\nproductive activities, basic income risks undermining the very source\nof funding on which it depends. Again, a number of responses are\navailable, including: claiming that perverse labour supply effects\nmight be reduced by taxing things other than individual income\n(natural resources, financial transactions, consumption, and so on);\nor stressing that the weight of this objection depends on the level at\nwhich the basic income is set (uncertainty perhaps recommending that\nwe start low and introduce increases experimentally).\n",
