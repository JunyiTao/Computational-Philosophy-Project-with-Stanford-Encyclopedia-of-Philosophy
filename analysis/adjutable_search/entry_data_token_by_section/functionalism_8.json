    "main_text": "Varieties of Functionalism || Analytic Functionalism\n3.3 Analytic Functionalism\n\nLike the logical behaviorism from which it emerged, the goal of\nanalytic functionalism is to provide dispositional, or other\n\u201ctopic-neutral\u201d, translations or analyses of our ordinary\nmental state terms or concepts. Analytic functionalism, of course, has\nricher resources than logical behaviorism for such translations, since\nit permits reference to certain causal and transitional relations that\na mental state has to stimulations, behavior, and other mental\nstates. So, for example, the statement \u201cBlanca wants some\ncoffee\u201d need not be rendered, as logical behaviorism requires,\nin terms such as \u201cBlanca is disposed to order coffee when it is\noffered\u201d, but rather as \u201cBlanca is disposed to order\ncoffee when it is offered, if she has no stronger desire to\navoid coffee\u201d. But any theory \u2013 and its Ramsey-sentence\n\u2013 that is acceptable to analytic functionalists must include\nonly generalizations about mental states, their environmental causes,\nand their joint effects on behavior that are so widely known and\n\u201cplatitudinous\u201d to count as analyzing our ordinary\nconcepts of the mental states in question. (See Smart 1959,\nArmstrong 1968, Shoemaker 1984a,b,c, Lewis 1972, and Braddon-Mitchell\nand Jackson 1996/2007.) \n\nA major question, of course, is whether a theory that limits itself to\nsuch \u201cplatitudes\u201d about the causal relations between\nstimulations, mental states, and behavior can make the right\ndistinctions among mental states, or even worse, is so\n\u201cliberal\u201d that it can be realized by systems without any\nsort of mentality at all, such as the economy of Bolivia (Block,\n1980b). However, commonsense psychology has more resources than it may\ninitially seem. First, (at least arguably) it need not be restricted\nto the \u201cplatitudes\u201d that can be accessed immediately; it\nmay take a certain amount of Socratic questioning to prompt us to\nrecognize certain similarities and differences among the\ncausal-relational properties of our mental states. The information\naccessed by such questioning, however, was always available to us, at\nleast in principle, and so can count as the deliverances of common\nsense, rather than empirical investigation. Moreover \u2013 and\ncontrary to the claims of some theorists (e.g. Churchland, 1981)\n\u2013 commonsense psychology is not stagnant. It can, over time,\nabsorb information acquired by exposure to empirical theories, while\nnonetheless retaining its platitudinous status. (Not that this is\nalways a good thing: think, for example, of how Freudian theory and\nvarious now discredited theories about the causes of autism,\ndepression, and impulsive behavior once seemed to be the deliverances\nof common sense.)\n\nNonetheless, many functionalists argue that commonsense theories do\nnot have sufficient resources to capture the causal roles of the\ninternal states that differentiate us from other cognitive (and\nnon-cognitive) systems. They look instead to a more empirically\ninformed, and presumably more restrictive, theory of mental states and\ntheir effects on behavior \u2013 psychofunctionalism \u2013 that\nderives primarily from reflection upon the goals and methodology of\nthe \u201ccognitive\u201d psychological theories that are the\ndescendants of scientific behaviorism.\n",
