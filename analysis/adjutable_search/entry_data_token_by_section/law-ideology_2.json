    "main_text": "Ideology and the Sources of Law\n3. Ideology and the Sources of Law\n\n\nThe well-known debate about the sources of law appears to be radically\nundercut by a view of law as ideology. The sources debate has usually\nbeen posed in terms of the extent to which morality is intrinsic to\nthe definition of law. Natural lawyers argue that what is law must\npartly depend on moral criteria. Following Thomas Aquinas, the\ntraditional criteria have not strayed far from the teachings of the\nRoman Catholic Church, but more recent natural law arguments, such as\nthose of Lon Fuller and Ronald Dworkin, have proffered secular\nstandards emanating from the procedural ideals of the rule of law or\nthe constitutionalism of American liberalism. All natural lawyers,\nhowever, are agreed that what the law is must be determined, in some\nsense, by what the law ought to be.\n\n\nPositivists, in contrast, have argued that what is law is determined\nonly by the institutional facts internal to a legal system, facts that\nmay or may not meet moral standards. Early positivists, such as Thomas\nHobbes and John Austin, argued that even the legitimacy of law did not\ndepend on moral criteria; law must be obeyed, however much it falls\nshort of moral ideals. More recent exponents, such as H.L.A. Hart and\nJoseph Raz, have argued that legal positivism is committed only to the\nidea that because what is law is a factual question, law\u2019s legitimacy\ncan be determined by moral criteria outside the law that might\nrecommend disobedience. All positivists, however, are agreed that,\nalthough law may meet moral criteria, what the law is and what it\nought to be should be kept distinct.\n\n\nThe natural law and legal positivist positions are united, however, in\nthe aim to provide a concept of the essence of law. This endeavour\nsupplies them with a common enemy in the view of law as ideology,\nwhich finds trying to determine the essence of law as fundamentally\nmisconceived. After all, if law is inevitably shaped by ideas\nemanating from power relations outside of the law, then it would seem\nthat law has no essence, be it moral or institutional. If law is\nreduced to ideology, or seen as its mere effect, then legality looks\ncontingent and unprincipled, having no necessary content or\ndefinition, no intrinsic character. If law both mirrors and distorts\nthe realities of power, it is power, not principles of legality, which\ntells us what law is. Thus for most mainstream legal theorists, the\nideological is no necessary feature of the law, and law should\ncertainly not be defined according to the radical conception where\nintrinsic to law is a mystification of reality, or an obfuscation of\nsocial relations in order to exact compliance.\n\n\nThe picture is more complicated, however. The Marxist view of law as\nideology does, after all, have some affinities with rival views on the\nsources of law. The Marxist view concedes to the positivist, for\nexample, that law emerges from the practices of society, though the\npractices are extra-legal \u2013 political, economic and social \u2013 rather\nthan the practices of institutional facts internal to a legal\nsystem. Social forces are ultimately determining of the content and\nform of a legal system. Indeed, the Marxist Louis Althusser\u2019s idea of\nideological state apparatuses (Althusser 1971) has a positivist flavour in its\ninsistence that political reality can be exhaustively described by\nreference to structures rather than norm-bearing agents. We might\nexpect that the radical exponent of ideology would resist the\ncombination of a positivist-ideology view. The radical would find in\nthe positivist emphasis on institutions a too uncritical attitude to\nthe ideological structures that shape those institutions. But it seems\npossible that the positivist position could be interpreted to remove\nany ascribing of legitimacy to the institutions that define law in\norder to accommodate the critique of the radical ideology\nposition.\n\n\nAs for the natural law position, the Marxist view of law as ideology\nconcedes to the natural lawyer that law is normative. What is\nideology, after all, but a set of values and ideals? However, on the\nMarxist view, the norms are defined in terms of the interests they\nserve, rather than the justice they embody. Law is normative, but it\nis certainly not moral, the Marxist insists against the natural\nlawyer. The critical aspect of the radical ideology view suggests an\nimpasse between the natural lawyer and the ideology position that is\nmore difficult to overcome than in the positivist case.\n\n\nOf course, natural lawyers and positivists could quite easily find\nroom for the liberal view of ideology as an action-oriented system of\nbeliefs as a supplement to their views about the sources of law, in the\nsense that ideology is part of the sociological landscape to which\ntheir concepts of law apply. Natural law can find popular expression in\na society\u2019s ideology, and positivist legal institutions might reflect\nideological beliefs.\n",
