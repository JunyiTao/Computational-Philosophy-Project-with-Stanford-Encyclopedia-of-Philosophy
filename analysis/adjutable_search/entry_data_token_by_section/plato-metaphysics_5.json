    "main_text": "The Range of Forms\n6. The Range of Forms\n\n\nThe middle period dialogues contain few arguments whose conclusion\nis that such and such a Form therefore exists. Even when\n\u2018argument\u2019 is given a very broad reading, the dialogues\ntend to address themselves to a limited number of Forms. These include\nthe moral properties familiar from Socrates' ethical inquiries and\nproperties such as Beauty, Equality, Hot and Cold, or Largeness. While\nthese are not the only properties mentioned in the course of\ndiscussion, the Argument from Recollection, the arguments about the\nobjects of knowledge and the \u2018summoners\u2019 from Books V\n(477ff) and VII (523ff), respectively, of the Republic, as\nwell as the final ascent to Beauty in the Symposium and the\nFinal Argument of the Phaedo all point to a particular kind of\nproperty, what scholars have labeled \u2018incomplete\n properties\u2019 (see Fine 1993; Irwin 1977).\n There is no precise way to specify what\ncounts as an incomplete property. Roughly, the idea is that an\nincomplete property is one which, when serving as a predicate, yields a\nstatement that cannot be understood on its own, because they must be\nadded on to, or completed in some sense, typically with a prepositional\nphrase. For instance, the predicate \u2018large\u2019, functioning in\na statement such as \u2018Shaquille O'Neal is large\u2019 must be\ncompleted with \u2018for a human\u2019; for while Shaq is large for a\nhuman he is not large compared with a tree. For some readers, then,\nwhile the Plato of the middle period may believe in a wide range of\nproperties, he is theoretically committed only to a limited number or\nrange of Forms, namely Forms of incomplete properties.\n\n\nForms are limited to these incomplete properties because, on this\nline of reasoning, these properties present special problems when they\nare instantiated in particulars. Chief among these problems is\n\u2018the compresence of opposites\u2019. This is the phenomenon\nwhere, with respect to any incomplete property, F, every\nsensible particular that is F is, in some sense, also\nnot-F. So, if Elsie the cow is large, she is also not-large;\nfor Elsie is large in comparison to her calf but not-large in\ncomparison to Elmer the bull. Thus Elsie is large and not-large. Since,\naccording to this approach, Plato is seeking a large that is the\nunqualified bearer of largeness, and since every particular is\ndisqualified in light of compresence, Plato postulates a Form,\nLargeness Itself, to be the unqualified bearer. By way of contrast,\nproperties such as being brown or being a cow do not suffer compresence\nwhen instantiated by particulars. That is, Elsie is a cow and is not\nnot-a-cow; she is brown (imagine she is brown all over) and is not\nnot-brown. (In the modern parlance, being a cow is classified as an\nessential property of Elsie whereas being brown is an accidental\nproperty. Thus the proponent of Forms only for incomplete properties\nlooks to a special subset of the accidental properties, namely those\nwhere there is no unqualified possessor.)\n\n\nIn order to appreciate fully the rationale for this account, one\nneeds to consider Plato's account of particulars, for the compresence\nof opposites is meant to capture in what sense particulars are\ndeficient with respect to Forms. Before turning to particulars, note\nthat it is left open by proponents of this position how we are to think\nof the nature of Forms and the self-predication statements involving\nForms, whether, for instance, \u2018Largeness is Largeness' signals that\nLargeness is what it is to be largeness, identical with largeness, or a\nlarge item, maybe the largest thing there is. Rather, we are told that\nthe key notion is being completely. So, just as Elsie is completely a\ncow, so Largeness is completely large: Largeness is a complete bearer\nof an incomplete property.\n",
