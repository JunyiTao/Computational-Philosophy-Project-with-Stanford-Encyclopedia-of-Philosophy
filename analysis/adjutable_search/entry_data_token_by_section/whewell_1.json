Philosophy of Science: Induction\n\nAccording to Whewell, all knowledge has both an ideal, or subjective\ndimension, as well as an objective dimension. He called this the\n\u201cfundamental antithesis\u201d of knowledge. Whewell explained\nthat \u201cin every act of knowledge \u2026 there are two opposite\nelements, which we may call Ideas and Perceptions\u201d (1860a, 307).\nHe criticized Kant and the German Idealists for their exclusive focus\non the ideal or subjective element, and Locke and the\n\u201cSensationalist School\u201d for their exclusive focus on the\nempirical, objective element. Like Francis Bacon, Whewell claimed to\nbe seeking a \u201cmiddle way\u201d between pure rationalism and\nultra-empiricism. Whewell believed that gaining knowledge requires\nattention to both ideal and empirical elements, to ideas as well as\nsensations. These ideas, which he called \u201cFundamental\nIdeas,\u201d are \u201csupplied by the mind itself\u201d\u2014they\nare not (as Mill and Herschel protested) merely received from our\nobservations of the world. Whewell explained that the Fundamental\nIdeas are \u201cnot a consequence of experience, but a result of the\nparticular constitution and activity of the mind, which is independent\nof all experience in its origin, though constantly combined with\nexperience in its exercise\u201d (1858a, I, 91). Consequently, the\nmind is an active participant in our attempts to gain knowledge of the\nworld, not merely a passive recipient of sense data. Ideas such as\nSpace, Time, Cause, and Resemblance provide a structure or form for\nthe multitude of sensations we experience. The Ideas provide a\nstructure by expressing the general relations that exist between our\nsensations (1847, I, 25). Thus, the Idea of Space allows us to\napprehend objects as having form, magnitude, and position. Whewell\nheld, then, that observation is \u201cidea-laden;\u201d all\nobservation, he noted, involves \u201cunconscious inference\u201d\nusing the Fundamental Ideas (see 1858a, I, 46). Each science has a\nParticular Fundamental idea which is needed to organize the facts with\nwhich that science is concerned; thus, Space is the Fundamental Idea\nof geometry, Cause the Fundamental Idea of mechanics, and Substance\nthe Fundamental Idea of chemistry. Moreover, Whewell explained that\neach Fundamental Idea has certain \u201cconceptions\u201d included\nwithin it; these conceptions are \u201cspecial modifications\u201d\nof the Idea applied to particular types of circumstances (1858b, 187).\nFor example, the conception of force is a modification of the Idea of\nCause, applied to the particular case of motion (see 1858a, I,\n184\u20135 and 236).\n\nThus far, this discussion of the Fundamental Ideas may suggest that\nthey are similar to Kant\u2019s forms of intuition, and indeed there\nare some similarities. Because of this, some commentators have argued\nthat Whewell\u2019s epistemology is a type of Kantianism (see, for\nexample, Butts 1973; Buchdahl 1991). However, this interpretation\nignores several crucial differences between the two views. Whewell did\nnot follow Kant in drawing a distinction between\n\u201cprecepts,\u201d or forms of intuition, such as Space and Time,\nand the categories, or forms of thought, in which Kant included the\nconcepts of Cause and Substance. Moreover, Whewell included as\nFundamental Ideas many ideas which function not as conditions of\nexperience but as conditions for having knowledge within their\nrespective sciences: although it is certainly possible to have\nexperience of the world without having a distinct idea of, say,\nChemical Affinity, we could not have any knowledge of certain chemical\nprocesses without it. Unlike Kant, Whewell did not attempt to give an\nexhaustive list of these Fundamental Ideas; indeed, he believed that\nthere are others which will emerge in the course of the development of\nscience. Moreover, and perhaps most importantly for his philosophy of\nscience, Whewell rejected Kant\u2019s claim that we can only have\nknowledge of our \u201ccategorized experience.\u201d The Fundamental\nIdeas, on Whewell\u2019s view, accurately represent objective\nfeatures of the world, independent of the processes of the mind, and\nwe can use these Ideas in order to have knowledge of these objective\nfeatures. Indeed, Whewell criticized Kant for viewing external reality\nas a \u201cdim and unknown region\u201d (see 1860a, 312). Further,\nWhewell\u2019s justification for the presence of these concepts in\nour minds takes a very different form than Kant\u2019s transcendental\nargument. For Kant, the categories are justified because they make\nexperience possible. For Whewell, though the categories do\nmake experience (of certain kinds) possible, the Ideas are justified\nby their origin in the mind of a divine creator (see especially his\ndiscussion of this in his 1860a). And finally, the type of necessity\nwhich Whewell claimed is derived from the Ideas is very different from\nKant\u2019s notion of the synthetic a priori (For a nuanced\nview of the relation between the views of Kant and Whewell, see\nDucheyne 2011.) I return to these last two points in the section on\nNecessary Truth below.\n\nI turn now to a discussion of the theory of induction Whewell\ndeveloped with his antithetical epistemology. From his earliest\nthoughts about scientific method, Whewell was interested in developing\nan inductive theory. At their philosophical breakfasts at Cambridge,\nWhewell, Babbage, Herschel and Jones discussed how science had\nstagnated since the heady days of the Scientific Revolution in the\n17th century. It was time for a new revolution, which they pledged to\nbring about. The cornerstone of this new revolution was to be the\npromotion of a Baconian-type of induction, and all four men began\ntheir careers endorsing an inductive scientific method against the\ndeductive method then being advanced by political economist David\nRicardo, logician Richard Whately, and their followers (see Snyder\n2011). (Although the four friends agreed about the importance of an\ninductive scientific method, Herschel and Jones would late take issue\nwith some aspects of Whewell\u2019s version, notably his antithetical\nepistemology.)\n\nWhewell\u2019s first explicit, lengthy discussion of induction is\nfound in his Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, founded upon\ntheir History, which was originally published in 1840 (a second,\nenlarged edition appeared in 1847, and the third edition appeared as\nthree separate works published between 1858 and 1860). He called his\ninduction \u201cDiscoverers\u2019 Induction\u201d and explained\nthat it is used to discover both phenomenal and causal laws. Whewell\nconsidered himself to be a follower of Bacon, and claimed to be\n\u201crenovating\u201d Bacon\u2019s inductive method; thus one\nvolume of the third edition of the Philosophy is entitled\nNovum Organon Renovatum. Whewell followed Bacon in rejecting\nthe standard, overly-narrow notion of induction that holds induction\nto be merely simple enumeration of instances. Rather, Whewell\nexplained that, in induction, \u201cthere is a New Element added to\nthe combination [of instances] by the very act of thought by which\nthey were combined\u201d (1847, II, 48). This \u201cact of\nthought\u201d is a process Whewell called \u201ccolligation.\u201d\nColligation, according to Whewell, is the mental operation of bringing\ntogether a number of empirical facts by \u201csuperinducing\u201d\nupon them a conception which unites the facts and renders them capable\nof being expressed by a general law. The conception thus provides the\n\u201ctrue bond of Unity by which the phenomena are held\ntogether\u201d (1847, II, 46), by providing a property shared by the\nknown members of a class (in the case of causal laws, the colligating\nproperty is that of sharing the same cause).\n\nThus the known points of the Martian orbit were colligated by Kepler\nusing the conception of an elliptical curve. Often new discoveries are\nmade, Whewell pointed out, not when new facts are discovered but when\nthe appropriate conception is applied to the facts. In the case of\nKepler\u2019s discovery, the observed points of the orbit were known\nto Tycho Brahe, but only when Kepler applied the ellipse conception\nwas the true path of the orbit discovered. Kepler was the first one to\napply this conception to an orbital path in part because he had, in\nhis mind, a very clear notion of the conception of an ellipse. This is\nimportant because the fundamental ideas and conceptions are provided\nby our minds, but they cannot be used in their innate form. Whewell\nexplained that \u201cthe Ideas, the germs of them at least, were in\nthe human mind before [experience]; but by the progress of scientific\nthought they are unfolded into clearness and distinctness\u201d\n(1860a, 373). Whewell referred to this \u201cunfolding\u201d of\nideas and conceptions as the \u201cexplication of conceptions.\u201d\nExplication is a necessary precondition to discovery, and it consists\nin a partly empirical, partly rational process. Scientists first try\nto clarify and make explicit a conception in their minds, then attempt\nto apply it to the facts they have precisely examined, to determine\nwhether the conception can colligate the facts into a law. If not, the\nscientist uses this experience to attempt a further refinement of the\nconception. Whewell claimed that a large part of the history of\nscience is the \u201chistory of scientific ideas,\u201d that is, the\nhistory of their explication and subsequent use as colligating\nconcepts. Thus, in the case of Kepler\u2019s use of the ellipse\nconception, Whewell noted that \u201cto supply this conception,\nrequired a special preparation, and a special activity in the mind of\nthe discoverer. \u2026 To discover such a connection, the mind must\nbe conversant with certain relations of space, and with certain kinds\nof figures\u201d (1849, 28\u20139).\n\nOnce conceptions have been explicated, it is possible to choose the\nappropriate conception with which to colligate phenomena. But how is\nthe appropriate conception chosen? According to Whewell, it is not a\nmatter of guesswork. Nor, importantly, is it merely a matter of\nobservation. Whewell explained that \u201cthere is a special process\nin the mind, in addition to the mere observation of facts, which is\nnecessary\u201d (1849, 40). This \u201cspecial process in the\nmind\u201d is a process of inference. \u201cWe infer more than we\nsee,\u201d Whewell claimed (1858a, I, 46). Typically, finding the\nappropriate conception with which to colligate a class of phenomena\nrequires a series of inferences, thus Whewell noted that\ndiscoverers\u2019s induction is a process involving a \u201ctrain of\nresearches\u201d (1857/1873, I, 297). He allowed any type of\ninference in the colligation, including enumerative, eliminative and\nanalogical. Thus Kepler in his Astronomia Nova (1609) can be\nseen as using various forms of inference to reach the ellipse\nconception (see Snyder 1997a). When Augustus DeMorgan complained, in\nhis 1847 logic text, about certain writers using the term\n\u201cinduction\u201d as including \u201cthe use of the whole box\nof [logical] tools,\u201d he was undoubtedly referring to his teacher\nand friend Whewell (see Snyder 2008).\n\nAfter the known members of a class are colligated with the use of a\nconception, the second step of Whewell\u2019s discoverers\u2019\ninduction occurs: namely, the generalization of the shared property\nover the complete class, including its unknown members. Often, as\nWhewell admitted, this is a trivially simple procedure. Once Kepler\nsupplied the conception of an ellipse to the observed members of the\nclass of Mars\u2019 positions, he generalized it to all members of\nthe class, including those which were unknown (unobserved), to reach\nthe conclusion that \u201call the points of Mars\u2019 orbit lie on\nan ellipse with the sun at one focus.\u201d He then performed a\nfurther generalization to reach his first law of planetary motion:\n\u201cthe orbits of all the planets lie on ellipses with the sun at\none focus.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve mentioned that Whewell thought of himself as renovating\nBacon\u2019s inductive philosophy. His inductivism does share\nnumerous features with Bacon\u2019s method of interpreting nature:\nfor instance the claims that induction must involve more than merely\nsimple enumeration of instances, that science must proceed by\nsuccessive steps of generalization, that inductive science can reach\nunobservables (for Bacon, the \u201cforms,\u201d for Whewell,\nunobservable entities such as light waves or properties such as\nelliptical orbits or gravitational forces). (For more on the relation\nbetween Whewell and Bacon see Snyder 2006; McCaskey 2014.) Yet,\nsurprisingly, the received view of Whewell\u2019s methodology in the\n20th century tended to describe Whewell as an anti-inductivist in the\nPopperian mold. (see, for example, Ruse 1975; Niiniluoto 1977; Laudan\n1980; Butts 1987; Buchdahl 1991). That is, it was claimed that Whewell\nendorsed a \u201cconjectures and refutations\u201d view of\nscientific discovery. However, it is clear from the above discussion\nthat his view of discoverers\u2019 induction does not resemble the\nview asserting that hypotheses can be and are typically arrived at by\nmere guesswork. Indeed, Whewell explicitly rejected the\nhypothetico-deductive claim that hypotheses discovered by non-rational\nguesswork can be confirmed by consequentialist testing. For example,\nin his review of his friend Herschel\u2019s Preliminary Discourse\non the Study of Natural Philosophy, Whewell argued, against\nHerschel, that verification is not possible when a hypothesis has been\nformed non-inductively (1831, 400\u20131). Nearly thirty years later,\nin the last edition of the Philosophy, Whewell referred to\nthe belief that \u201cthe discovery of laws and causes of phenomena\nis a loose hap-hazard sort of guessing,\u201d and claimed that this\ntype of view \u201cappears to me to be a misapprehension of the whole\nnature of science\u201d (1860a, 274). In other mature works he noted\nthat discoveries are made \u201cnot by any capricious conjecture of\narbitrary selection\u201d (1858a, I, 29) and explained that new\nhypotheses are properly \u201ccollected from the facts\u201d (1849,\n17). In fact, Whewell was criticized by his contemporary David\nBrewster for not agreeing that discoveries, including\nNewton\u2019s discovery of the universal gravitation law, were\ntypically made by accident.\n\nWhy has Whewell been misinterpreted by so many modern commentators?\nOne reason has to do with the error of reading certain terms used by\nWhewell in the 19th century as if they held the same meaning they have\nin the 20th and 21st. Thus, since Whewell used the terms\n\u201cconjectures\u201d and \u201cguesses,\u201d some writers\nbelieve that he shares Popper\u2019s methodology. Whewell made\nmention, for instance, of the \u201chappy guesses\u201d made by\nscientists (1858b, 64) and claimed that \u201cadvances in\nknowledge\u201d often follow \u201cthe previous exercise of some\nboldness and license in guessing\u201d (1847, II, 55). But Whewell\ngenerally used these terms to connote a conclusion that is not (yet)\nconclusively confirmed. The Oxford English Dictionary tells\nus that prior to the 20th century the term \u201cconjecture\u201d\nwas used to connote not a hypothesis reached by non-rational means,\nbut rather one which is \u201cunverified,\u201d or which is \u201ca\nconclusion as to what is likely or probable\u201d (as opposed to the\nresults of demonstration). The term was used this way by Bacon,\nKepler, Newton, and Dugald Stewart, writers whose work was well-known\nto Whewell. In other places where Whewell used the term\n\u201cconjecture\u201d he suggests that what appears to be the\nresult of guesswork is actually what we might call an \u201ceducated\nguess,\u201d i.e., a conclusion drawn by (weak) inference. Whewell\ndescribed Kepler\u2019s discovery, which seems so \u201ccapricious\nand fanciful\u201d as actually being \u201cregulated\u201d by his\n\u201cclear scientific ideas\u201d (1857/1873, I, 291\u20132).\nFinally, Whewell\u2019s use of the terminology of guessing sometimes\noccurs in the context of a distinction he draws between the generation\nof a number of possible conceptions, and the selection of one to\nsuperinduce upon the facts. Before the appropriate conception is\nfound, the scientist must be able to call up in his mind a number of\npossible ones (see 1858b, 79). Whewell noted that this calling up of\nmany possibilities \u201cis, in some measure, a process of\nconjecture.\u201d However, selecting the appropriate conception with\nwhich to colligate the data is not conjectural (1858b, 78). Thus\nWhewell claimed that the selection of the conception is often\n\u201cpreluded by guesses\u201d (1858b, xix); he does not,\nthat is, claim that the selection consists in guesswork. When\ninference is not used to select the appropriate conception, the\nresulting theory is not an \u201cinduction,\u201d but rather a\n\u201chasty and imperfect hypothesis.\u201d He drew such a\ndistinction between Copernicus\u2019 heliocentric theory, which he\ncalled an induction, and the heliocentric system proposed by\nAristarchus in the third century BCE to which he referred as a hasty\nand imperfect hypothesis (1857/1873, I, 258).\n\nThus Whewell\u2019s philosophy of science cannot be described as the\nhypothetico-deductive view. It is an inductive method; yet it clearly\ndiffers from the more narrow inductivism of Mill. Whewell\u2019s view\nof induction has the advantage over Mill\u2019s of allowing the\ninference to unobservable properties and entities, and for this reason\nis a more accurate view of how science works. (For more detailed\narguments against reading Whewell as a hypothetico-deductivist, see\nSnyder 2006; Snyder 2008; McCaskey 2014).\n",
