    "main_text": "Pragmatist Feminist Philosophical Themes || Valuing Experience\n3.1 Valuing Experience\n\nA historical examination of pragmatism shows a reverse ordering of the\ntheory-action method sometimes assumed in philosophic thought, and\noften critiqued by feminist thinkers. In its privileging of theory,\nsome philosophical texts leave us with the impression that ideas\nnormally originate from ideal and often solitary theoretical thinking\nthat is then diffused into the general culture. However, in the case\nof many women activists, like Jane Addams, it is evident that public\nand political activism shaped the character of the philosophy. Indeed,\nshe advised leaders to \u201cmove with the people\u201d, aiming to\nfirst \u201cdiscover what people really want\u201d so that they can\ntogether uncover a way forward that neither could alone \u201csee\nvery clearly till they come to it\u201d (\u201cDemocracy and\nSocial\u201d, 1902 [2002]: 69). Such a method is consistent with\npragmatism; as 20th century pragmatist Sidney Hook said,\n\u201csocial action is the mother of inspiration and not, as is\nusually imagined, its offspring\u201d (1940 [1991]: 3). Feminist\ntheory has also grown out of the activism of the women\u2019s\nmovement; it incorporates the understandings that have resulted from\nsocial activism. Pragmatist philosophers often made these same points\nin their critiques of positivism. Both pragmatists and feminists\nadvocate for the practical use of philosophy in the realm of personal\nand public experience; pragmatism and feminism generally also share a\nsocial and/or political focus and advocate specific cultural\nchanges.\n\nThe pragmatist commitment to situated knowledge, rather than abstract\nor idealized knowing has been influential in some fields of feminist\nethics, particularly in care ethics. Maurice Hamington draws on\nAddams\u2019s ethics to articulate \u201ca proactive embodied\ncare\u201d based on \u201c habits of interaction\u201d (2004: 104).\nGeorge Herbert Mead\u2019s philosophy of the self has also played a\nprominent role in care ethics for both Hamington and Heather Keith.\nAs Keith said of Mead\u2019s concept: \u201c the self is wholly\nintegrated into an ecology of both physical and social relationships\nfacilitates a conception of selfhood valuable to the sort of personal\nand moral liberation called for by feminism\u201d (1999: 330). \n\nCurrently feminists and pragmatists share an effort to radically\nchange oppressive political and social structures, an effort that\nfinds resonance with the early feminist-pragmatists. Jane Addams and\nother feminist reformers like Charlotte Perkins Gilman were\ncontinuously involved in fighting oppression, especially of women,\nchildren, and minorities. Pragmatism\u2019s continued insistence that\nphilosophy address the problems of the current social situation\nsupports critiques of gender, race and class oppression, even though\nthe majority of pragmatism\u2019s male founders were often relatively\ninattentive to cultural gender-related oppression.\n",
