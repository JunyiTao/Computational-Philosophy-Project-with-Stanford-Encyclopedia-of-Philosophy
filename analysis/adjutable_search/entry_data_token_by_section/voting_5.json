    "main_text": "The Moral Obligation to Vote || A General Moral Obligation Not to Vote?\n2.1 A General Moral Obligation Not to Vote?\n\nWhile many hold that it is obligatory to vote, a few have argued that\nmany people have an obligation not to vote under special\ncircumstances. For instance, Sheehy (2002) argues that voting when one\nis indifferent to the election is unfair. He argues that if one\u2019s\nvote makes a difference, it could be to disappoint what otherwise\nwould be have been the majority coalition, whose position is now\nthwarted by those who, by hypothesis, have no preference. \n\nAnother argument holds that voting might be wrong because it is an\nineffective form of altruism. Freiman (2020) argues that when people\ndischarge their obligations to help and aid others, they are obligated\nto pursue effective rather than ineffective forms of altruism (see\nalso MacAskill 2015). For instance, suppose one has an obligation to\ngive a certain amount to charity each year. This obligation is not\nfundamentally about spending a certain percentage of one\u2019s money. If\na person gave 10% of their income to a charity that did no good at\nall, or which made the world worse, one would not have discharged the\nobligation to act beneficently. Similarly, Freiman argues, if a person\nis voting for the purpose of aiding and helping others, then they\nwould at the very least need to be sufficiently well-informed to vote\nfor the better candidate, a condition few voters meet (see section 3.2\nbelow). In part because most voters are in no position to judge\nwhether they are voting for the better or worse candidates, and in\npart simply because individual votes make little difference, votes and\nmost other forms of political action (such as donating to political campaigns,\ncanvassing, volunteering, and the like) are highly ineffective forms\nof altruism. Freiman claims that we are instead obligated to pursue\neffective forms of altruism, such as collecting and making donations\nto the Against Malaria Foundation. \n",
