Displayed\nbelow is a review of what has been described above, organized by the\nvariables discussed earlier.\n\n Conventional bifurcated test: legal causation is constituted by\ntwo distinct components, cause- in-fact and proximate causation, with\neach component of this bifurcated test having contested meanings:\n\n\n Cause-in-fact tests\n\n\n Explicitly defined counterfactual test: the defendant\u2019s\naction must be necessary to the occurrence of the harm.\n Modified counterfactual tests, where the defendant\u2019s act\nmust be:\n\n\n A necessary element of a set of factors that are together\nsufficient for the harm, where the total set of factors is itself\nunnecessary for that harm to have occurred (the \u201cINUS\u201d and\n\u201cNESS\u201d tests)\n Necessary to every detail in the time, place, and manner of an\neffect\u2019s occurrence\n Necessary to accelerations (but not retardings) of the\neffect\n Not necessary in the sense that the existence of\nthe act is necessary, so long as that aspect of the\ndefendant\u2019s action as made that act culpable, is necessary\n A \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in the production of the harm,\nwhere the necessity of that act is an always sufficient criterion of a\ncausal factor being \u201csubstantial\u201d while not being a\nnecessary criterion\n Necessary to an increase in the chance of an effect\noccurring (rather than being necessary to the effect actually\noccurring)\n\n Tests for causal skeptics: cause in fact as a conclusion of\npolicy rather than a natural relation existing antecedent to law\n\n\n Ad hoc balancing of all policies (Critical Legal Studies\nand Legal Realists)\n Incentive-based policies and probabilistic tests of cause-in-fact\n(legal economists)\n\n\n Proximate cause tests\n\n\n Tests regarding proximate \u201ccausation\u201d to be a balance\nof policies\n\n\n Tests based on a wide range of policies\n\n\n Ad hoc policy balancing in each case where the resulting\npolicy balance is honored as a conclusion of \u201cproximate\ncausation\u201d in that case\n Rules justified by policy balancing, such as:\n\n\n Year and a day rule\n First house rule\n Last wrongdoer rule\n\n\n Tests based on the single policy of gauging culpability (mental\nstate) of the actor\n\n\n Foreseeability test: was the harm foreseeable to the defendant as\nhe acted?\n Harm-within-the-risk test: was the harm that occurred an instance\nof the type of harm the risk of which (or the intent or foresight of\nwhich by the defendant) made the defendant\u2019s action negligent\n(or otherwise culpable)?\n\n\nTests regarding proximate causation to be a matter of fact (about\nreal causal relations) rather than a matter of policy\n\n\n Space-time proximity tests and the petering out of causation as\nit runs through a large number of events in the chain between cause\nand effect\n Direct cause test: sudden breaks in the causal chain formed by\nthe existence of \u201cintervening\u201d or\n\u201csuperseding\u201d causes that literally break causal chains\nthat would otherwise exist\n\nTests regarding proximate causation to be partly causal and partly\npolicy: direct cause combined with the requirement that the\nintervening cause be unforeseeable to the defendant at the time she\nacted\n\n\nUnified tests: legal causation requires a natural, unitary, causal\nrelation\n\n\nAspect cause\n (above, I.A.2.d.)\n aggressively applied\nCause as a scalar primitive: the original substantial factor\ntest\nPhysically reductionist tests: cause as physical process\n\n\n",
