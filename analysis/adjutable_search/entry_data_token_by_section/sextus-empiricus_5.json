    "main_text": "The nature of Sextus\u2019 Pyrrhonism (PH I) || Tranquillity\n3.3 Tranquillity\n\n\nHow does it come about that someone acquires the skeptical skill?\nSextus offers an answer in PH I 12. People have become\nSkeptics because they are seeking tranquillity. Certain people\n(\u2018men of talent\u2019 in Annas and Barnes\u2019 translation;\n\u2018smart and energetic people\u2019 in Cooper\u2019s nice gloss\n(2012: 282)) are \u2018troubled by the anomaly in things\u2019 (I 12)\nand want to take away this \u2018trouble\u2019, i.e., become tranquil\n(the word translated \u2018tranquillity\u2019 is etymologically\nrelated to the word translated \u2018trouble\u2019, and more\nliterally means \u2018lack of trouble\u2019). Presumably Sextus has\nin mind that one might be troubled by the various discrepancies that\nthe world offers, such as this one (taken from PH III 202):\n\u2018among us, tattooing is thought to be shameful and a dishonour,\nbut many Egyptians and Sarmatians tattoo their babies\u2019. By\nconsidering these two facts, one has both the impression that tattooing\nis bad and the impression that it is good: those who pay attention to\nsuch anomalies will be \u2018puzzled as to which of them they should\nrather assent to\u2019 (PH I 12 again). So begins the quest\nfor finding the answer and ridding oneself of the irksome\n\u2018trouble\u2019 that such questions induce. Sextus seems to be\nexplaining how it is that someone could come to be investigating\nquestions with the sort of single-mindedness the skeptic has, a\nsingle-mindedness which results in the intense scrutiny of all sides of\na question. This will in turn explain how it is that anyone would\nend up with the skeptical skill: this intense scrutiny will lead the\nscrutiniser to develop skill at coming up with considerations speaking\nto both sides of a question and evaluating them for convincingness.\n\n\n(For a slightly different take on what Sextus is up to in PH\nI 12, see Cooper 2012, who interprets Sextus as telling us about his\n\u2018original skeptic predecessors\u2019 (283) or\n\u2018proto-skeptics\u2019 (285), who came upon the skeptical skill\nas a result of their reflections, \u2018as something then for later\nworriers to avail themselves of\u2019 (282 n.76). In other words,\nSextus is primarily offering\n\u2018a narrative history of the\nexperiences of those who became the first to practice the skeptic\nphilosophy\u2019 (288), rather than an account of how anyone at any\ntime might find themselves becoming a skeptic.)\n\n\nSo if we are smart and energetic we seek intellectual tranquillity, or\nfreedom from the troubles which come from being assailed by the many\ncontradictions the world seems to offer. Sextus elaborates further in\nPH I 25\u201330 that \u2018the aim of the Skeptic is\ntranquillity in matters of opinion\u2019 (I 26). But whereas to begin\nwith, \u2018Skeptics were hoping to acquire tranquillity by deciding\nthe anomalies in what appears and is thought of\u2019 (I 29), they\nfound themselves unable to settle the questions they were\ninvestigating and ended up suspending judgment (because of their\nSkeptical skill). But rather than this making them even more troubled,\nthey discovered\u2014to their surprise\u2014that in fact\ntranquillity followed after all! They did not find the answers they\nhad been looking for, because the Skeptical skill will preclude you\nfrom finding such answers; nonetheless, tranquillity did ensue. Sextus\nillustrates this fortuitousness with a story about Apelles the\npainter: \n \nhe was\npainting a horse and wanted to represent in his picture the lather on\nthe horse\u2019s mouth; but he was so unsuccessful that he gave up,\ntook the sponge on which he had been wiping off the colours from his\nbrush, and flung it at the picture. And when it hit the picture, it\nproduced a representation of the horse\u2019s lather.\n(PH I 28)\n \nYou search for tranquillity, and it will come, just\nnot in the way you were expecting. More succinctly, Sextus says that\ntranquillity follows suspension of judgment \u2018as a shadow follows\na body\u2019 (I 29; for the same image, cf. DL IX 107). The idea behind the shadow image seems to\nbe that tranquillity will indeed follow suspension of judgment, but it\nis not the thing you were expecting. So, burning with curiosity, you\nengage in the investigation whether P, expecting to find tranquillity\nwhen you discover whether P; you end up not discovering whether P but\nrather suspending judgment whether P, and much to your surprise,\ntranquillity still follows. Striker finds in Sextus\u2019 imagery the\nmessage that \u2018Skeptical tranquillity can only be reached if one\ndoes not try for it\u2019 (1990a: 193).\n\n\nWill being a Pyrrhonian Skeptic bring you tranquillity, as Sextus\nadvertises? Two objections have been brought against it.\n\n\n(1) Striker (1990a) argues that Sextus is guilty of an inconsistency.\nSextus obviously does not think there is such a thing as the goal of\nlife (no self-respecting Pyrrhonian Skeptic could have such a\ntheoretically loaded view). But then how can Sextus talk consistently\nof the goal of the Skeptic being tranquillity?\n\nSuch is the\npenalty of arguing, on the one hand, that there is no such thing as a\ngoal of life [\u2026], and on the other, that Pyrrhonism is the only\nway to it. (Striker 1990a: 193)\n\nStriker\u2019s charge might be\noverstretched, since Sextus would characterise himself as\nsuspending judgment over the question whether there is a goal\nof life (rather than as rejecting that there is such a thing),\nbut the tension she points to still remains. Additionally, Striker\nargues against Sextus that there is a psychologically crucial\ningredient in tranquillity that is missing from the Pyrrhonist\u2019s\nversion, namely \u2018the thought that one has or can easily get all\nthe goods one might need\u2019 (ibid). That thought is missing because\nof course the Skeptic does not have any beliefs about what is good or\nbad, and indeed Sextus himself touts Pyrrhonism as having the advantage\nover other philosophies, and over the belief systems of ordinary\npeople, that Pyrrhonists\n\nshed the additional opinion that each\nof these things [sc. feelings such as hunger, thirst, etc. that we\ncannot avoid in virtue of being human] is bad in its nature.\n(PH I 30; cf. Frede 1979: 22)\n\n This prompted Striker to\nconclude: \n \nThe Pyrrhonists would have done better, I believe, to\nstay out of the competition for guides to the happy life, and limit\nthemselves to the field of epistemology. (1990a: 193)\n \nPerhaps,\nthough, the tranquillity that Sextus promises is only supposed to be\nintellectual tranquillity, freedom from the trouble or anxiety that\nhaving an unanswered question in your life brings. It can\u2019t\npromise you freedom from your back pain or an irrational fear of\ndeath.\n\n\n(2) Myles Burnyeat raises a different objection to Sextus\u2019 claim that\nthe Skeptic will find tranquillity: \n\nataraxia is hardly to be attained if he is not in some sense\nsatisfied\u2014so far\u2014that no answers are forthcoming, that\ncontrary claims are indeed equal. (1980: 56) \n In other words, in order to settle back into intellectual\ntranquillity, the Skeptic must have some belief along these lines: no\nenquiry will ever produce an answer. He must become a global skeptic,\nand not just a local one. However, in the opening sentences of\nPH Sextus seems to preclude the possibility that Pyrrhonian\nskeptics espouse such a global belief in the impossibility of\ndiscovery when he contrasts the Pyrrhonian Skeptics, who\n\u2018are still investigating\u2019, with other, dogmatic, skeptics,\nwho hold that the truth \u2018cannot be apprehended\u2019\n(PH I 2). And quite apart from the apparent unavailability of\nthis particular belief to the Skeptic, there is also the general worry\nthat the Skeptic has no beliefs whatsoever (thus precluding him from\nbelieving that no enquiry will ever produce an answer). It is to this\nquestion that we shall turn next. But note that if it turns out that\nthe Skeptic can have beliefs, and that the belief that no\nenquiry will ever produce an answer is one of the beliefs available to\nthe skeptic, then we might be able to answer Burnyeat\u2019s objection (for\nmore on this see below, 3.6).\n",
