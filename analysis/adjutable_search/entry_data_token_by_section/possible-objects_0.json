    "main_text": "What They Are\n1. What They Are\n\nPossible objects\u2014possibilia (sing.\npossibile)\u2014are objects that are possible. What it is to\nbe an object\u2014which is a basic and universal metaphysical\ncategory\u2014will not be discussed but will be simply assumed as\nunderstood. What it is to be possible is the focus. Possibility of an\nobject should be understood in tandem with another notion, namely,\nactuality. The two notions are related at least in the following way:\n(i) every actual object is a possible object. A more controversial\nrelation between the two notions is expressed as follows: (ii) not\nevery possible object is an actual object, that is, some possible\nobject is a non-actual object.\n\nThere is a wide-spread conservative view on objects, which says that\nany object is an actual object. In other words, the adjective\n\u2018actual\u2019 is redundant, for it excludes no object. From\nthis it follows that non-actual possible objects are not objects, that\nis, they are nothing. Thus on this view, the adjective\n\u2018possible\u2019 is equivalent to \u2018actual\u2019 when\napplied to objects and (ii) is false. This makes the notion of a\npossible object, or equivalently the notion of an actual object,\nuninteresting. The notion of an object is the basic notion and does\nall the work. There is another conservative view on objects, which\ndoes not deal in actuality or possibility directly. It deals in\nexistence instead. It is the view that any object is an existing\nobject. On this view, the following analog of (ii) is false: not every\nobject is an existing object, that is, some object is a non-existing\nobject. This view makes the notion of an existing object equivalent to\nthat of an object; existence adds nothing to objecthood. If we combine\ntalk of actuality and talk of existence, we obtain five alternative\nconservative views with varying degrees of conservatism:\n\n\n(1) Any object is an actual existing object;\n\n(2) Any object is an actual object, that is, it is either an actual\nexisting object or an actual non-existing object;\n\n(3) Any object is an existing object, that is, it is either an actual\nexisting object or a non-actual existing object;\n\n(4) Any object that is actual is an existing object;\n\n(5) Any object that exists is an actual object.\n\n\n(1) is a stronger claim than the other four. (2) and (3) are stronger\nthan (5) and (4), respectively. (1)-(3) give characterizations of all\nobjects, whereas (4) and (5) are more limited in scope. When the verb\n\u2018exists\u2019 is understood with the most comprehensive domain\nof discourse (assuming the availability of such a domain), (5) is\nknown as actualism. If the domain of discourse for\n\u2018exists\u2019 is stipulated to consist only of actual objects,\n(5) is trivial and compatible with possibilism, the position\nwhich says that some object is outside the domain consisting of all\nactual objects; cf. (ii). Most of those who advertise their\npositions as actualist hold not only (5) with the most comprehensive\ndomain of discourse in mind but also (1), and therefore (2)-(4) as\nwell. There are some theorists who hold (5), or at least do not deny\n(5), but deny (1). They do so by denying (3), that is, by maintaining\nthat some object is a non-existing object. Such a view is one version\nof Meinongianism. But let us start with actualism and possibilism.\n\nWe shall first examine possibilism. It is superficially the most\ncommonsensical position. It is superficially commonsensical to hold\nthat some objects are not actual: e.g., Santa Claus, the Fountain of\nYouth. If we understand this view in terms of existence, that is, as\nthe claim that there are\u2014that is, there exist\u2014some objects\nthat are not actual, we have possibilism. As we have noted,\n\u2018exist\u2019 here should not mean \u201cactually exist\u201d\nbut should be understood with a larger domain of discourse in mind.\nSuch a domain is the domain containing not only actual objects but\nalso non-actual possible objects as genuine objects. To flesh out the\nidea of such a domain as proposed by the best-known version of\npossibilism, it is necessary to start with the idea of a possible\nworld. After we articulate and examine possibilism as couched in the\npossible-worlds framework, we shall discuss versions of actualism also\ncouched in the possible-worlds framework. We shall then examine other\ntheories outside the possible-worlds framework.\n",
