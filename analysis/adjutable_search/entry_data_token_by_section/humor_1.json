    "main_text": "The Superiority Theory\n2. The Superiority Theory\n\nWith these comments of Hobbes and Descartes, we have a sketchy\npsychological theory articulating the view of laughter that started in\nPlato and the Bible and dominated Western thinking about laughter for\ntwo millennia. In the 20th century, this idea was called\nthe Superiority Theory. Simply put, our laughter expresses feelings of\nsuperiority over other people or over a former state of ourselves. A\ncontemporary proponent of this theory is Roger Scruton, who analyses\namusement as an \u201cattentive demolition\u201d of a person or\nsomething connected with a person. \u201cIf people dislike being\nlaughed at,\u201d Scruton says, \u201cit is surely because laughter\ndevalues its object in the subject\u2019s eyes\u201d (in Morreall\n1987, 168).\n\nIn the 18th century, the dominance of the Superiority\nTheory began to weaken when Francis Hutcheson (1750) wrote a critique\nof Hobbes\u2019 account of laughter. Feelings of superiority,\nHutcheson argued, are neither necessary nor sufficient for laughter.\nIn laughing, we may not be comparing ourselves with anyone, as when we\nlaugh at odd figures of speech like those in this poem about a\nsunrise:\n\n\nThe sun, long since, had in the lap\n\nOf Thetis taken out his nap;\n\nAnd like a lobster boil\u2019d, the morn\n\nFrom black to red began to turn.\n\n\n\n\nIf self-comparison and sudden glory are not necessary for laughter,\nneither are they sufficient for laughter. Hutcheson says that we can\nfeel superior to lower animals without laughing, and that \u201csome\ningenuity in dogs and monkeys, which comes near to some of our own\narts, very often makes us merry; whereas their duller actions in which\nthey are much below us, are no matter of jest at all.\u201d He also\ncites cases of pity. A gentleman riding in a coach who sees ragged\nbeggars in the street, for example, will feel that he is better off\nthan they, but such feelings are unlikely to amuse him. In such\nsituations, \u201cwe are in greater danger of weeping than\nlaughing.\u201d \n\nTo these counterexamples to the Superiority Theory we could add more.\nSometimes we laugh when a comic character shows surprising skills that\nwe lack. In the silent movies of Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and\nBuster Keaton, the hero is often trapped in a situation where he looks\ndoomed. But then he escapes with a clever acrobatic stunt that we\nwould not have thought of, much less been able to perform. Laughing at\nsuch scenes does not seem to require that we compare ourselves with\nthe hero; and if we do make such a comparison, we do not find\nourselves superior. \n\nAt least some people, too, laugh at themselves\u2014not a former\nstate of themselves, but what is happening now. If I search high and\nlow for my eyeglasses only to find them on my head, the Superiority\nTheory seems unable to explain my laughter at myself. \n\nWhile these examples involve persons with whom we might compare\nourselves, there are other cases of laughter where no personal\ncomparisons seem involved. In experiments by Lambert Deckers (1993),\nsubjects were asked to lift a series of apparently identical weights.\nThe first several weights turned out to be identical, and that\nstrengthened the expectation that the remaining weights would be the\nsame. But then subjects picked up a weight that was much heavier or\nlighter than the others. Most laughed, but apparently not out of\nHobbesian \u201csudden glory,\u201d and apparently without comparing\nthemselves with anyone.\n",
