The Nature of Envy\n1.1 Defining Envy\n\nThis entry follows the widespread assumption that envy is an\n emotion.[1]\n That is not to say that it is a mere feeling. Emotions are generally\nagreed to be more than feelings. Most emotion theorists could agree on\nthis vague characterization: emotions are syndromes of thoughts,\nfeelings, motivations, and bodily movements, loosely enough bound\ntogether that a given emotional episode may not require the occurrence\nof every element in the syndrome. Most theories of emotion privilege\none of these elements as central, or even essential, to emotion.\nCognitive theories identify a defining thought or judgment. Feeling\ntheories and Motivational theories respectively take a particular\naffective experience or a distinctive motivational role as central or\nessential to a given emotion type.\n\nThe specific contours of the emotional syndrome of envy are\ncontroversial. It is agreed that envy involves an envier\n(\u201cSubject\u201d), a party who is envied\n(\u201cRival\u201d)\u2014this may be a person or group of\npersons\u2014and some possession, capacity or trait that the subject\nsupposes the rival to have (the \u201cgood\u201d). The good might be\nsomething that only one party could possibly possess (the crown\njewels, or being the world\u2019s best go player), or it might be something\neasily duplicated. It is sometimes held that the good may even be\nutility, happiness, or some psychological state that Subject could\nattribute to Rival even if there were no material difference in their\npossessions or capacities. Most philosophers who have sought to define\nenvy agree in treating it as a form of distress experienced by the\nsubject because he does not possess the good and the rival does, and\nin attributing a desire for the good to Subject. Many, but not all, go\non to add that envy involves a desire that the rival not have the\ngood. This disagreement is explored below, [see benign and invidious\nenvy]. Envy is widely but not universally agreed to be a symptom or\ninstance of the human tendency to evaluate one\u2019s well-being\ncomparatively, by assessing how well one is doing in comparison with\nothers. Influential definitions of envy include:\n\n\nEnvy is pain at the good fortune of others. (Aristotle,\nRhetoric, Bk II, Chapter 10) \n\nEnvy is a propensity to view the well-being of others with distress,\neven though it does not detract from one\u2019s own. [It is] a reluctance\nto see our own well-being overshadowed by another\u2019s because the\nstandard we use to see how well off we are is not the intrinsic worth\nof our own well-being but how it compares with that of others. [Envy]\naims, at least in terms of one\u2019s wishes, at destroying others\u2019 good\nfortune. (Kant, The Metaphysics of Morals 6:459)\n\nEnvy is that passion which views with malignant dislike the\nsuperiority of those who are really entitled to all the superiority\nthey possess. (Adam Smith, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, p.\n244)\n\n1.2 Envy vs. Jealousy\n\nOrdinary language tends to conflate envy and jealousy. The\nphilosophical consensus is that these are distinct emotions.While it\nis linguistically acceptable to say that one is jealous upon hearing\nabout another\u2019s vacation, say, it has been plausibly argued that one\nis feeling envy, if either, in such a case. According to Farrell\n(1980) and Neu (1980), both envy and jealousy are three-place\nrelations; but this superficial similarity conceals an important\ndifference. Jealousy involves three parties, the subject, the rival,\nand the beloved; and the jealous person\u2019s real locus of concern is the\nbeloved, a person (or being) whose affection he is losing or fears\nlosing. The locus of concern in jealousy is not the rival. Whereas\nenvy is a two party relation, with a third relatum that is a good\n(albeit a good that could be a particular person\u2019s affections); and\nthe envious person\u2019s locus of concern is the rival. \n\nOn this way of distinguishing envy from jealousy there is a difference\nbetween them even when the good that the rival has is the affection of\nanother\n person.[2]\n Roughly, for the jealous person the rival is fungible and the beloved\nis not fungible. So he would be equally bothered if the beloved were\nconsorting with someone else, and would not be bothered if the rival\nwere. Whereas in envy it is the other way around. Because envy is\ncentrally focused on competition with the rival, the subject might\nwell be equally bothered if the rival were consorting with a different\n(appealing) person, but would not be bothered if the\n\u2018good\u2019 had gone to someone else (with whom the subject was\nnot in competition). Whatever the ordinary meaning of the terms\n\u2018envy\u2019 and \u2018jealousy,\u2019 these considerations\ndemonstrate that these two distinct syndromes need to be\ndistinguished.\n1.3 \u2018Benign\u2019 and \u2018Invidious\u2019 Envy\n\nMany authors posit a distinction between two kinds of envy: a\nmalicious or invidious form, and a benign, emulative, or admiring\nvariety of\n envy.[3]\n Typically, the point of the distinction is to identify a class of\ncases in which envy is somehow permissible or justifiable and separate\nthem from cases in which it is not. While details differ, the general\nidea is that invidious envy involves a desire that the rival lose the\ngood, whereas benign envy does\n not.[4]\n But other philosophers claim that benign envy is not envy at\n all.[5]\n Like many disagreements over the nature of emotions, this one\nthreatens to become a merely verbal dispute, but it can be understood\nas a substantive question about the character of an empirical\n phenomenon.[6]\n\nSome of the examples advanced on behalf of the suggested bifurcation\nthreaten to obscure the issue. It will not do, for instance, simply to\npoint out that people commonly say that they envy someone\u2019s skill in\ncases where it is quite implausible to suppose that they have any\ndesire that the person loses the skill. There is undoubtedly a common\ntendency to use the term \u2018envy\u2019 for any desire for\nsomething that is possessed by another. But, given the looseness of\nnatural language noted above, we must not simply assume that these are\nreally cases of the emotional syndrome of envy. Although some\ndiscussions of envy seem to treat any desire for [an instance of] what\nanother person has as envy, this threatens to assimilate some cases of\nenvy to\n admiration.[7]\n\nMost parties to the debate would grant that not every case in which\nsomeone would like something that someone else possesses is a case of\ngenuine envy. First, envy is typically agreed to be a form of pain or\ndistress\u2014an unpleasant emotion. To fancy someone else\u2019s linens\nis not yet to envy them. So not every such desire should be counted as\na case of benign envy. Furthermore, even a painful desire for what\nsomeone else possesses might be better described as longing than envy.\nIf you badly (painfully) want the new Mercedes convertible, then you\nlong for it. If you then discover that your neighbor has bought one,\ndoes your longing become envy? To avoid turning this into a matter of\nstipulation or a verbal dispute, it should be a substantive\npsychological question whether you envy her for it. Envy should not be\nheld to follow as a logical consequence of the conjunction of your\npainful desire with the belief that she has (an instance of) its\nobject. But then there must be something more to envy than painfully\nwanting something that (you know) someone else has.\n\nRobert Young suggests that what differentiates envy from mere longing\nis that, in (even benign) envy, the subject is pained because the\nrival has the good. But it is questionable whether this proposal\nsucceeds as a defense of benign envy. If the \u201cbecause\u201d in question is\ncausal-explanatory, this seems insufficient to mark the relevant\ndistinction. After all, ordinary longing may be occasioned by seeing\nthe good in someone else\u2019s possession. Perhaps if your neighbor hadn\u2019t\nacquired the convertible, it would never have come to your attention.\nIt would then be true that you want it because she has it, yet it\nseems possible that this is longing, not envy. Suppose that you would\nhave been equally pained by not having it regardless of how you\ndiscovered its existence. Then the fact that, as it happens, your longing\nwas caused by seeing it in the neighbor\u2019s driveway does not\nsuffice to make this a case of envy.\n But perhaps Young\u2019s \u201cbecause\u201d offers something like\nthe agent\u2019s reason for being pained, or the content of a thought at\nwhich she is pained. In other words, perhaps the point is to emphasize\nthe idea that the subject really is bothered specifically by the\ndifference in possession, not just by his own lack of the good. But if\nso, more would need to be said to explain how how the envy can be\nbenign. If what pains the subject, or what he evaluates as bad, is\nreally the disparity between the subject and the rival (not just the\nsubject\u2019s lack), it is hard to see how the subject could lack any\ndesire for the rival to lose the comparative advantage. After all, by\nhypothesis the situation in which the rival loses the good without the\nsubject getting it would be better than the status quo, as far as the\nsubject\u2019s envy is concerned \u2013 inasmuch as there would then be no\ndisparity to be bothered by. Of course the subject may not prefer all\nthings considered that the rival lose the good. But if he is only\nmotivated to improve his position, and lacks any desire for the rival\nto lose the good, then why think that what bothers him is really the\ndisparity, rather than just his own lack? \n\nSara Protasi (2016) offers a more complex taxonomy of envy which\nincludes a version of benign envy that she calls \u201cemulative\nenvy.\u201d She draws two cross-cutting distinctions: whether the\nsubject is focused upon the good or upon the rival, and whether she\nperceives the good as obtainable or unobtainable. Focus is understood\nnot in terms of salience or conscious attention, but as a matter of\nevaluative concern: \u201cwhat the envier focuses on is whatever she\ncares about, from a prudential point of view.\u201d (2016, p. 4) In\nemulative envy, the envier is focused on the good and believes himself\ncapable of obtaining it. She is motivated to improve her standing, not\nto bring down the rival. But emulative envy is supposed to be distinct\nfrom admiration or even longing. It is meant to be a species of envy\nin general, which Protasi defines as \u201can aversive reaction to a\nperceived inferiority to a similar other, with regard to a good that\nis relevant to the sense of identity of the envier.\u201d (2016, p.2)\nA question for this account is what role the perceived inferiority to\nthe rival can be playing in emulative envy, if the envier is held to\ncare only about the good, and not the inferiority as such. If it is\nplaying no role, then why think this is a species of envy in general,\nrather than a (no doubt common and important) emotion of some other\nsort? But if it is allowed that emulative envy does also include a\nconcern about inferiority as such, distinct from the desire for the\ngood, then the question is how to make that concern compatible with an\ninsistence that there is no desire that the rival lose the good. \n\nEven those who deny that \u201cbenign envy\u201d is a kind of envy\n(hereafter, \u201cdeniers\u201d) will grant the existence of cases\nin which people want to have skills or other traits that are possessed\nby another person, and are pained by their lack, but in which they\nhave no desire at all for the other person to lose those traits. Call\nsuch a state \u201cemulative desire.\u201d Apparently some\nother languages have a word for that\n state.[8]\n What deniers deny is that emulative desire is an instance of envy (or\nof \u201cenvy proper\u201d, as Rawls puts it). But what is at stake\nin such a claim? We have already noted that ordinary usage surely\npermits application of \u201cenvy\u201d in such cases, and in others\nbesides, so linguistic propriety is not the issue. One way of\nunderstanding the debate concerns which taxonomy of mental states\ncarves emotions at their joints\u2014that is, carves them in ways\nthat reflect psychological kinds that support predictions and\nexplanatory generalizations. \n\nOne way to develop the deniers\u2019 position is as\n follows.[9]\n Envy is a distinctive kind of psychological state that is essentially\ncompetitive. It is concerned specifically with unfavorable comparisons\nto others with whom the subject in some ways sees himself as in\ncompetition. On this view, the characteristic dissatisfaction of envy\nsupplies or embodies some level of motivation toward whatever would\nameliorate the situation: in other words, toward either outdoing or\nundoing the rival\u2019s advantage Which of those motivations will emerge\nin action depends on many factors. It depends on what the situation\naffords, including the probabilities and expected costs and benefits\nof success at either option. And it depends on other attitudes and\ndesires of the subject, including how much he likes the rival, whether\nhe thinks it would be wrong to deprive him of the good, and how much\nthat wrongness matters to him.\n\nOn this view, there can still be cases of genuine envy in which the\nsubject would not take steps to undermine the rival. He would not even\npush a button to deprive the rival in secret\u2014because he likes\nthe rival, or because that would be a rotten thing to do to anyone.\nCall such a person a \u201cdecent envier.\u201d A decent envier may\nsincerely believe that he has no desire whatever that the rival lose\nthe good. He will be wrong about this, but it can still be true that\nhe would not act on that desire. The attribution of genuine envy in\nsuch a case nonetheless explains some things. It explains why even a\ndecent envier\u2019s pain is prone to go away, along with some of his\nambition to achieve the good, if the rival should lose it. Why should\nenvy go away in such cases, if all the envier wanted was to secure the\ngood himself? It also explains why even decent enviers may be more\nlikely to be amused by a story that shows the rival in a negative\nlight, and why they become drawn to other goods that the rival\nacquires within the scope of the rivalry. And it explains why some\npreviously decent enviers become indecent enviers, or at least become\naware of some ambivalence about the rival\u2019s possession of the\ngood, when their efforts to secure the good for themselves prove\nhopeless.\n\nIn cases of emulative desire, on the other hand, presumably none of\nthese things should be expected. So what deniers want to say about\nbenign envy is that either it is not really envy (it\u2019s just\nemulative desire, or something else in the neighborhood) or it is not\nreally benign. Whether the deniers\u2019 view should be preferred may hinge\non what explanatory advantages defenders of benign envy can offer for\na taxonomy that includes emulative desire as a species of envy. \n1.4 Envy vs. Resentment\n\nAlthough much of the psychological literature on envy supposes that\nenvy is concerned with matters of perceived injustice, most\nphilosophers reject this\n suggestion.[10]\n The received view is that envy is to be distinguished from\nresentment. The latter is held to be a moral emotion, whereas the\nformer is not. What makes a given emotion a moral emotion has been\nglossed in various ways. Roughly, the idea is that moral emotions are\nones that somehow embody moral principles or appraisals. Resentment is\na moral emotion because a given emotional episode does not qualify as\na state of resentment unless the subject holds some moral complaint\nagainst the object of the state. The claim that envy is not a moral\nemotion should be understood as a denial that any moral complaint is\npart of the nature of envy as such. It is compatible with the\npossibility of any number of cases in which envious people also hold\nmoral complaints against those they envy. And it is also compatible\nwith the possibility of envying someone for some moral feature.\n\nIt seems clear that in many (perhaps even most) cases of envy, the\nsubject is liable to find some moral complaint with which to justify\nnegative feelings toward his rival. This would explain various\nexperimental findings that correlate feelings of envy with complaints\nof injustice. But, of course, such complaints may be defensive\nrationalizations of rancorous feelings, rather than elements in envy.\nClaims about which of the various thoughts that commonly attend a\ngiven type of emotion belong in a characterization of that emotion\ntype are best defended within the context of a general theory of how\nto individuate emotion types, which is beyond the scope of this entry.\nIn any case, some version of the thesis that envy is not a moral\nemotion seems both plausible and necessary to make sense of the debate\nover whether egalitarianism is motivated by envy (see section 3.1\nbelow).\n2. The Rationality of Envy\n\nAssessments of the rationality of emotions take various forms. It is\nuseful to distinguish the prudential advisability of emotions (whether they are good for the person who has them) from\ntheir fittingness (roughly, whether the appraisal of circumstances\ninvolved in the emotion is accurate or not). Both of these \nassessments are to be distinguished from various ethical appraisals of\nemotions. Most authors who address the issue seem to agree that envy\nis seldom advisable: insofar as one is able to control or influence\none\u2019s emotions, it is best not to be envious, because envy harms those\nwho feel it. This is sometimes urged simply on the grounds that envy\nis a form of pain, but more often because, in envy, a person\u2019s\nsubjective sense of well-being, self-worth or self-respect is\ndiminished. But if envy involves certain characteristic patterns of\nmotivation, such as a motive to outdo or undo the rival\u2019s advantages,\nthen the advisability of envy may be strongly dependent on the\nadvisability of the actions it motivates. And whether these actions\nare advisable, in turn, depends upon whether they are efficient means\nto the ends at which they aim, and whether those ends are themselves\nin the subject\u2019s interests. Thus an adequate assessment of the\nprudential advisability of envy may well depend on whether the envious\nsubject\u2019s sense that he is worse off because of his rival\u2019s possession\nof the good that he lacks is accurate. If it is accurate, then\nmotivation to change the situation may well be beneficial for the\nSubject. We turn now to issues of accuracy. \n\nIt is commonly supposed that emotions, envy included, involve a way of\ntaking the circumstances\u2014a thought, construal, appraisal, or\nperception of the circumstances\u2014which can then be assessed for\nfittingness (objective rationality) and/or warrant (subjective\n rationality).[11]\n Thus fear can be unfittingly directed at something that isn\u2019t really\ndangerous, or fittingly directed at something that is. And it can be\nunwarrantedly directed at something the subject has good reason to\nbelieve poses no danger, or warrantedly directed at what she has good\nreason to think dangerous\u2014even if that good reason is supplied\nby misleading evidence, so that the object of the emotion is not, in\nfact, dangerous. Similarly, in light of the discussion above, we might\nsay that envy involves thinking that the rival has something good that\nthe subject lacks, and negatively evaluating this difference in\npossession, per se. Each of the various strands in this way of taking\nthe circumstances, then, can be appraised for fittingness and warrant.\nWe will focus on fittingness here, but analogous points can be made in\nterms of warrant. Envy will be unfitting, for instance, if the rival\ndoes not really have the good, or if the \u2018good\u2019 isn\u2019t\nreally good\u2014for instance if the envy is directed at some\npossession that the subject would not really value if he knew its true\nnature. These suggestions are uncontroversial. A more interesting\nquestion concerns the last element in envy\u2019s characteristic appraisal:\nthe negative evaluation of the difference in possession. This too\nmight be thought to be amenable of broadly rational appraisal.\n\nSome philosophers suggest that envy is always or typically irrational,\nand they seem to have in mind the charge that it is\n unfitting.[12]\n Theirs is a restricted version of the Stoic critique of emotions,\naccording to which (roughly) all emotions are unfitting because they\ninvolve taking various worldly things to matter that don\u2019t really\nmatter. Not many contemporary philosophers are attracted to the Stoic\nview of value, which is embedded in an idiosyncratic ancient\ncosmology. But perhaps specific emotions can be convicted of the\nputative mistake, and envy appears to be a likely suspect. If envy\ninvolves taking the difference in possession between subject and rival\nto be bad in itself, then, if such differences are not bad in\nthemselves, envy is systematically unfitting. Developing this charge\ndemands getting clearer about the sense in which envy can be said to\ninvolve taking the difference in possession to be bad in itself.\n\nSuppose that envy includes some desire that the rival not have the\ngood. Then envy may be interpreted so as to involve a preference for\nthe situation in which neither subject nor rival have the good to the\none in which rival has it and subject does\n not.[13]\n Call this the \u201cenvious preference.\u201d The envious\npreference is invoked as a basis for the claim that envy appraises the\nformer situation as better than the latter. But better in what\nrespect? There are a number of possibilities, and we will consider\njust two. First, it might be held to be better, from the point of view\nof the universe (\u201cimpersonally better\u201d for short).\nSecondly, it might be held to be better for the subject.\n\nIf envy holds that the situation in which neither has the good is\nbetter, impersonally, than the one in which Rival has it, this can be\ncriticized as an axiological\n mistake.[14]\n Surely the world is a better place, ceteris paribus, if\nsomeone possesses a given good than if no one does. But this is too\nquick. First, consider cases in which rival has acquired the good by\nwrongdoing. Arguably the world is not a better place when the fortunes\nof some are wrongfully improved. Secondly, an extreme egalitarian may\nhold that inequalities themselves are prima facie bad, because they\nare unjust. On that view, it may sometimes be better that neither\npossesses a given good than that one does. Either of these\nconsiderations might then be invoked as a defense of fittingness of\nenvy. Thus, if envy is interpreted as making a claim about impersonal\nvalue, it will be difficult to prevent moral considerations from\nguiding verdicts about its\n fittingness.[15]\n While this does not completely collapse the distinction between envy\nand resentment, it renders it considerably murkier.\n\nAlternatively, envy can be held to present the difference in\npossession between subject and rival as bad specifically for Subject.\nThis interpretation of envy\u2019s characteristic appraisal is more\nplausible, and it jibes better with the doctrine that envy is not a\nmoral feeling. Envy can nonetheless be criticized as irrational, on\nthis interpretation, for taking something to be bad for Subject that\nis not in fact bad for him. What matters to how well things are going\nfor Subject is a function of what goods Subject has, not what goods\nhis rival has, the critic will suggest. Hence, while the present state\nof affairs is worse for Subject than a situation in which he has the\ngood and Rival lacks it, it is not worse than a situation in which\nneither has the good. So there is no self-interested reason for\nSubject to have the envious preference. Envy is therefore\nsystematically unfitting because it takes something to be bad for the\nsubject that is not in fact bad for him.\n\nThe cogency of this argument for the irrationality of envy depends, of\ncourse, on the plausibility of its claims about well-being. If people\ndo in fact systematically care about the possessions of others, and\nregard themselves as worse or better off accordingly as they stack up\nagainst their selected comparison class, some subjectivist accounts\nwill license taking this concern as itself a part of these subjects\u2019\nwell-being\u2014in which case, some envy will be fitting. Whereas\nmost objective accounts of well-being either treat it as a measure of\nprimary goods, or supply content restrictions on the desires whose\nsatisfaction contributes to well-being which would exclude desires\nlike the envious preference. One recent defense of the claim that envy\nis sometimes fitting relies on the idea that being excellent in\nvarious domains of human achievement contributes to well-being and yet\nis essentially a comparative matter (D\u2019Arms and Jacobson, 2005). If\nsuch excellences, or other positional goods, are granted to contribute\nin themselves to well-being, then it appears that envy will be fitting\nwhenever a rival\u2019s diminution with respect to the relevant positional\ngood improves the Subject\u2019s position.\n3. Envy and Justice\n3.1 Egalitarianism and Envy\n\nA recurring suggestion in the history of philosophical and political\nthought has been that envy supplies the psychological foundations of\nthe concern for justice, and, especially, of egalitarian conceptions\nof\n justice.[16]\n Both the proponents of this charge and those who contest it have\ncommonly taken it to be a damaging suggestion for\n egalitarianism.[17]\n It is worth distinguishing genetic versions of the charge from\noccurrent ones. Genetic versions concern the historical or\ndevelopmental sources of a concern for equality. Freud, for instance,\nheld that concern with justice is the product of childhood envy of\nother children leading to concern for equal treatment, and thereby to\n\u2018group spirit\u2019: \u201cIf one cannot be the favorite\noneself, at all events nobody else shall be the favorite.\u201d (p.\n120). Nietzsche can be read as tendering an account of the origins of\negalitarian values or ideals in envy in his account of the\n\u201cslave revolt in\n morality.\u201d[18]\n Whatever their merits, these claims should be distinguished from the\nclaim that those who defend egalitarian views of justice are motivated\nby occurrent bouts of envy or propensities to\n them.[19]\n\nDefense of the charge that egalitarianism is occurrently motivated by\nenvy hinges both on the commitments of egalitarianism and on the\nnature of envy. The common motif is that egalitarians wish to do away\nwith the advantages of the better off, and that they wish to do this\nbecause they are bothered by the very fact that the better off are\nbetter off. This is supposed to show that egalitarians are motivated\nby envy. Whether this is a fair characterization of any prominent\negalitarian position is certainly open to\n question.[20]\n But in any case, in light of the distinction between envy and\nresentment, it is clear that there can be no direct move from the\nclaim that egalitarians are \u2018bothered\u2019 by the advantages\nof the better off to the claim that they are envious. For another\npossibility is that what they feel is resentment, occasioned by the\nthought that the present distribution is\n unjust.[21]\n Note that the claim that what is felt is resentment does not depend\nupon showing that the resentment is fitting\u2014that the\ndistribution really is unjust. It would suffice to show that the\nresponse really is a moral evaluation, justified or not.\n\nIt seems clear that the occurrent version of the charge is only\ndamaging to egalitarianism if the basic distinction between envy and\nresentment is accepted. Otherwise, envy could be granted to motivate\negalitarianism, but this would not impute any concern aside from\nconcerns with justice to the position. With the distinction in hand,\nhowever, the charge is difficult to defend. Envy does not arise in\ncases where inequalities favor the subject. So defenders of the charge\nappear to be committed to the falsifiable thesis that egalitarians are\ninconsistent in their commitment to\n inequality.[22]\n If the charge were true, egalitarians should oppose only the\ninequalities that are unfavorable to their own interests. To the\nextent that egalitarians are sincere and consistent in the embrace of\ntheir principles, this counts against the charge that their occurrent\nmotivation is\n envy.[23]\n3.2 Envy-free allocations\n\nA different way in which envy might be thought to motivate broadly\negalitarian thought is by appeal to the idea of envy-free allocations.\nA distribution of goods is said to be \u201cenvy-free\u201d when no\none prefers anyone else\u2019s bundle of resources to her\n own.[24]\n The suggestion here is not that envy is the psychological motivation\nfor the concern with equality, but rather that, where a distribution\nin fact produces envy, this is grounds to doubt the fairness of the\ndistribution. But \u2018envy\u2019 in these contexts is a technical\nterm for any situation in which someone prefers another\u2019s bundles of\ngoods, and does not refer to the emotional syndrome with which this\nentry is\n concerned.[25]\n3.3 Rawls\u2019 Problem of Envy\n\nIn constructing the \u201coriginal position\u201d from which\ndeliberators select principles of justice in A Theory of Justice,\nRawls assumes that the imagined deliberators are not motivated by\nvarious psychological propensities. One of these is the propensity to\nenvy. One justification Rawls offers for this stipulation is that what\nprinciples of justice are chosen should not be affected by individual\ninclinations, which are mere accidents. This rationale is less\npersuasive if envious concerns are universal in human nature. Another\njustification is that parties in the original position should be\nconcerned with their absolute level of primary social goods, not with\ntheir standing relative to others as\n such.[26]\n He then proceeds in the second part of the argument for the\nprinciples of justice to consider whether, in fact, human propensities\nbeing what they are, the tendency to envy will undermine the\narrangements of a well-ordered society (in which case the principles\nof justice would have to be reconsidered). The \u2018Problem of\nEnvy\u2019 is the possibility that widespread envy might do just\nthis. The reason that Rawls takes this to be a live possibility is\nthat \u201cthe inequalities sanctioned by the difference principle\nmay be so great as to arouse envy to a socially dangerous\n extent.\u201d[27]\n\nThe primary way in which Rawls thinks envy could pose such a threat is\nif it comes to undermine the self-respect of those who are less well\noff. It might do this, he thinks, if the differences between the haves\nand the have-nots are so great that, under existing social conditions,\nthe differences cannot help but cause loss of self-esteem. \u201cFor\nthose suffering this hurt,\u201d he continues, \u201cenvious\nfeelings are not irrational; the satisfaction of their rancor would\nmake them better off.\u201d (534) He calls this \u201cexcusable\ngeneral envy,\u201d and offers two reasons for doubting that it will\nbe prevalent in a well-ordered society. First, he argues that the\nliberties and political status of equal citizens encourage\nself-respect even when one is less well off than others. Second, he\nsuggests that background institutions (including a competitive\neconomy) make it likely that excessive inequalities will not be the\nrule.\n\nRawls\u2019 discussion is in some tension with the received view of envy.\nHe supposes that \u201cthe main psychological root of our liability\nto envy is a lack of self-confidence in our own worth combined with a\nsense of impotence.\u201d This leads him to expect that envy will be\nmore severe the greater the differences between subjects and those\nthey\n envy.[28]\n However most observers of envy, from Aristotle on, have urged that it\nis most often felt toward those with whom the subject perceives\nhimself as in competition, so that typically very great disparities in\nwell-being are not envied. And there is some empirical evidence to\nsupport this\n claim.[29]\n This is usually explained by the hypothesis that the benchmarks\nagainst which people measure their comparative well-being are, in some\n(possibly metaphorical) sense, local. If true, this calls into\nquestion whether preventing excessive inequalities is likely to reduce\nthe frequency or intensity of envy. But it also suggests that the\nphenomenon of general, or class, envy toward which Rawls\u2019 discussion\nis directed may not pose a substantial threat to the well-ordered\nsociety.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aristotle, <em>The Basic Works of Aristotle</em>, R.
