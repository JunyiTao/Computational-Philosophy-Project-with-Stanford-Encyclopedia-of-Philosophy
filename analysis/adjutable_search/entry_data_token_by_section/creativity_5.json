    "main_text": "Can Creativity be Learned?\n3. Can Creativity be Learned?\n\nThere is a long tradition of thinkers who answer no to the\nquestion above. Two of the most influential are from the eighteenth\ncentury\u2014Edward Young and Immanuel Kant\u2014who were concerned\nspecifically with genius, the capacity for achieving the very\nhighest levels of creativity. In Conjectures on Original\nComposition (1759), Young says,\n\n\nAn Original may be said to be of a vegetable nature;\nit rises spontaneously from the vital root of genius; it\ngrows, it is not made \u2026. (1759 [1966: 7])\n\n\nHis idea is that originality emerges naturally from something\nimplanted in us by nature, and it can only be hindered by learning.\nYoung seems to think of learning as proceeding either through\nimitation or through the following of rules, and both, he thinks, are\ndetrimental to originality. Regarding imitation he writes,\n\n\nBorn Originals, how comes it to pass that we die\nCopies? That meddling ape Imitation\u2026 destroys\nall mental individuality\u2026. (1759 [1966: 20])\n\n\nAnd insofar as learning is \u201ca great lover of rules\u201d, he\nwarns that it \u201csets rigid bounds to that liberty, to which\ngenius often owes its supreme glory\u201d (1759 [1966: 13]).\n\nKant makes similar claims in his Critique of Judgment (1790).\nLike Young, he takes genius to be a natural capacity, though a very\nrare one:\n\n\nsuch a skill cannot be communicated, but is apportioned to each\nimmediately from the hand of nature and dies with him. (1790: \u00a747\n5:309 [2000: 188])\n\n\nIt certainly cannot be learned through imitation:\n\n\ngenius is entirely opposed to the spirit of imitation. Now\nsince learning is nothing but imitation, even the greatest aptitude\nfor learning, facility for learning (capacity) as such, still does not\ncount as genius. (1790: \u00a747 5:308 [2000: 187])\n\n\nNor can it be learned through rules, Kant holds, for genius is\n\n\nthe talent (natural gift) that gives the rule to art \u2026 the\ninborn predisposition of the mind (ingenium) through\nwhich nature gives the rule to art. (1790: \u00a746 5:307 [2000:\n186])\n\n\nFor Kant, a genius does not follow rules; a genius invents\nthe rules, indirectly, by creating exemplary works from which other\nartists might extract rules and undertake \u201ca methodical\ninstruction in accordance with rules\u201d (1790: \u00a749 5:318\n[2000: 196]).\n\nYoung and Kant are concerned with genius, specifically, but if we\nextend their reasoning to creativity in general, as Berys Gaut (2014a)\nhas noted, we can discern two lines of argument:\n\n\nThe imitation argument\n\nAll learning is a form of imitation.\nImitating someone or something is incompatible with being\ncreative.\nSo, one cannot learn to be creative.\n\n\nThe rules argument\n\nAll learning consists in the following of rules.\nFollowing rules is incompatible with being creative.\nSo, one cannot learn to be creative.\n(2014a: 266)\n\n\n\nGaut points out, first of all, that both arguments are invalid. In\nboth cases, what the premises would entail is that learning cannot be\ncreative, that, in other words, you cannot learn creatively\n(a claim about how you can learn). But even if that were\ntrue, it wouldn\u2019t follow that you cannot learn to\nbe creative (a claim about what you can learn). If you\nabsorb the advice of a creative writing manual then this act of\nlearning may not itself be creative. But if the manual is\neffective\u2014and we\u2019ll see in a moment how it can\nbe\u2014then what you will learn is how to become more creative.\n\nGaut also challenges the premises of these arguments. To start with\nthe first premise of the imitation argument, it simply isn\u2019t\ntrue that all learning proceeds through imitation, as we learn many\nthings through direct experience, trial and error, and many other\nmeans.\n\nThe second premise is also suspect. Something superficially close to\nit is true: mere copying is incompatible with being creative.\nBut to the extent that we learn from others by imitating them, this is\nnot merely a matter of copying them. When a child learns to speak the\nlanguage of those around her, she doesn\u2019t simply parrot the\nexact same sentences she hears; she absorbs the vocabulary and\nunderlying grammar in a way that enables her to form new sentences of\nher own devising.\n\nNow for the rules argument. Contrary to the first premise, it cannot\nbe the case that all learning consists in following rules, Gaut\nargues, because for any given rule there will be hard cases where it\nis unclear whether or how the rule applies to them, and so an\nindividual still has to use her own judgment in applying the rule.\n\nThe second premise is false too. Recall the distinction from\n \u00a73\n above between two kinds of rules. An algorithm serves as an\nexact plan, specifying both the outcome and the path for getting to it\nin exact detail. In contrast, a heuristic is a looser\n\u201crule of thumb\u201d that leaves room for an agent to exercise\nher own judgment, choice, and creativity in determining whether, when,\nand how to follow the rule. While algorithms, in this sense, may\npreclude creativity, heuristics do not, which is why, as we\u2019ll\nsee below, the teaching of creativity so often takes the form of\nheuristics.\n\nThere is a sense in which the question at hand can be answered\nempirically: We can show that creativity can be taught simply\nby pointing to cases where it has been taught. Gaut himself\ndiscusses such examples as they occur in mathematics and fiction\nwriting, which we\u2019ll turn to below. But while such cases may\nsuffice to show that creativity can be taught, Gaut further\nenriches our understanding by explaining how this is\npossible. He does so partly by articulating and then debunking\nthe imitation and rules arguments to the contrary. But in addition, he\noffers the following positive argument to show that creativity can be\ntaught and learned. He calls it \u201cthe constitutive\nargument\u201d because it begins with his view of what constitutes or\ndefines creativity itself.\n\n\nThe constitutive argument\n\nCreativity is a disposition\u2014involving both the\nability and the motivation\u2014to\nproduce things that are new and valuable, and to do so in ways that\nexpress one\u2019s agency through \u201cthe exercise of choice,\nevaluation, understanding, and judgment\u201d (Gaut 2014a: 273).\nAt least some people can learn to enhance their creative\nmotivation.\nAt least some people can learn to enhance their creative\nabilities.\nSo, at least some people can learn to\nbecome more creative.\n\n\n\nPremise 1 recapitulates the point we\u2019ve already seen Gaut and\nothers defend (in\n \u00a72.3\n above), that creativity is not merely an ability but a disposition or\ntrait, whereby the creative person is disposed or motivated to\nexercise that ability when given the opportunity.\n\nIn support of premise 2, Gaut argues that you can strengthen both your\nintrinsic motivation to be creative (when you take pleasure in your\ncreative activities), as well as your extrinsic motivation to be\ncreative (when you are rewarded with praise, grades, pay, etc. for\nyour creative efforts).\n\nDefending premise 3, Gaut points out that you can develop your ability\nto produce valuable new things by practising and strengthening the\nrelevant skills. And this development can be substantially aided by\nlearning certain heuristics.\n\nHeuristics are indeed a staple of education in creative pursuits from\nmathematics (draw the figure; consider special cases; consider extreme\ncases; generalize the problem; look for a related problem,\netc.\u2014see P\u00f3lya 1945; Schoenfeld 1982, 1987a, 1987b) to\ncreative writing (write what you know; be specific and detailed in\ndescribing sensory experiences; practice seeing similarities between\ndissimilar things; show, don\u2019t tell, etc.\u2014see Bell &\nMagrs 2001; Anderson 2006; Maybury 1967; S. Kaufman & J. Kaufman\n2009). Gaut also identifies several heuristics that might be used to\nfoster creativity in philosophy, even among children (cf. M. Gaut\n2010; B. Gaut & M. Gaut 2011).\n\nWith this last theme, Gaut has a kindred spirit in Alan H\u00e1jek\n(2014, 2016, 2017, 2018), who has independently proposed that by using\nvarious heuristics, philosophers can enhance their abilities to make\nvaluable contributions to their field, including ideas that are\ndistinctively creative. It has been said that anyone of average talent\ncan become a strong chess player by learning and internalizing certain\nchess heuristics: \u201ccastle early\u201d, \u201cavoid\nisolated pawns\u201d, etc. Analogously, H\u00e1jek suggests,\nphilosophy has a wealth of heuristics\u2014philosophical\nheuristics\u2014although they have not been as well documented\nand studied. Sometimes these take the form of useful heuristics for\ngenerating counterexamples, such as \u201ccheck extreme cases\u201d.\nSometimes they suggest ways of generating new arguments out of old\nones, as in \u201carguments involving possibility can often be recast\nas arguments involving time, or space\u201d. Sometimes they provide\ntemplates for positive arguments (e.g., ways of showing that something\nis possible). H\u00e1jek offers a catalogue of such philosophical\nheuristics to show that, contrary to a common assumption, creativity,\neven in philosophy, can be compatible with, and enhanced by, following\nrules.\n",
