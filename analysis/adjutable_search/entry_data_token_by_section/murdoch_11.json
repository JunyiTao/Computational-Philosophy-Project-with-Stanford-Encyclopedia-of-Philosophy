    "main_text": "Moral Agency as Inner Activity\n6. Moral Agency as Inner Activity\n\nMurdoch\u2019s form of moral realism has influenced a critique of the\nfact/value dichotomy; the development of a virtue-ethical form of\nmoral realism focused on right-making characteristics prompting acts\nin the public world; and, more generally, debates about practical\nreason and reasons for action. But the significance of Murdoch\u2019s\nphilosophy, and in particular of her version of moral realism, for an\nunderstanding of morality significantly transcends those\ncontributions. (Setiya recognizes that Murdoch herself is barely\ninterested in reason or rationality [Setiya 2013], though she does\nvery occasionally talk about reasons. She would not regard \u201cpractical\nrationality\u201d as a welcome framework for her thought, even if her\ninsights have bearing on what is currently understood by that notion.\nShe says, in promotion of both her perfectionism and love\nas a central ethical concept, \u201c\u2018Act lovingly\u2019 will\ntranslate \u2018Act perfectly\u2019 whereas \u2018Act\nrationally\u2019 will not\u201d [IP: 102/384].) Bakhurst argues that\nMurdoch\u2019s moral realism is a substantive moral view, not a\nmeta-ethical view as McDowell\u2019s is (a rejection of\n point 7,\n that philosophers can and should propound morally neutral views of\nmorality) (Bakhurst 2020:\n 218).[4]\n\nWe may focus on two such contributions to moral philosophy connected\nto Murdoch\u2019s moral realism: (A) an expanded conception of moral\nagency; (B) the notion of a \u201cfabric of ethical being\u201d.\n\nOn (A), Murdoch delineates a broader notion of moral agency than that\ninvolved in reasons internalism and the perception of or sensitivity\nto action-guiding reasons within situations. She seeks to demonstrate\na form of moral agency that takes place solely in the mind of the\nagent with no expression in her behavior in the public world. She does\nso through an extended example in IP, which serves other purposes as\nwell (especially the importance of the inner life for morality,\nagainst\n point 5\n [the inner life is not very important for morality]), and is\nextensively cited in the secondary literature. The example is of\nM, the mother-in-law of D. Throughout D\u2019s\nmarriage to M\u2019s son, M has viewed D as\n\u201cpert and familiar, insufficiently ceremonious, brusque,\nsometimes positively rude, always tiresomely juvenile\u201d. She\nfeels her son has \u201cmarried beneath him\u201d (IP: 17/312).\nM behaves toward D without revealing her real opinions\nand feelings. Murdoch highlights this feature by imagining that\nD moves away or dies, and that M therefore comes to have\nno opportunity to engage in behavior directed at D.\n\nM settles into her fixed picture of D. But something\nprompts her to reflect on her view, recognizing both her jealousy of\nD and her own snobbishness. She tries to look at the D\nshe knew in a new way, and over time, as the result of her attempts to\nsee D anew, her view of D changes. \n\n\nD is discovered to be not vulgar but refreshingly simple, not\nundignified but spontaneous\u2026not tiresomely juvenile but\ndelightfully youthful. (IP: 17\u201318/313)\n\n\nMurdoch imagines that M\u2019s new view of D is\naccurate and truthful, recognizing that it need not be. Murdoch sees\nM\u2019s attempts to see D as exemplifying activity on\nM\u2019s part, though issuing in no outward behavior, activity\nthat is moral in character. Murdoch concludes that our moral agency is\nnot exhausted by our outward behavior, nor by outward behavior plus\nmental acts conceptually tied to outward behavior, like deciding,\nchoosing, and deliberating. And the moral philosophy of her time did\nnot leave any clear place for this purely inner moral activity of\nattention.\n",
