    "main_text": "What is Meant by \u201cMental Simulation\u201d? || Relations, States, and Processes\n2.3 Relations, States, and Processes\n\nIn order to overcome the difficulties faced by trying to define\n\u201cmental simulation of\u201d in terms of either\nreplication or reuse, philosophers have built on the insights\nof both RES and\n REU\n and have proposed definitions that combine replication and reuse\nelements (Currie & Ravenscroft 2002; in recent years, Goldman\nhimself seems to have favoured a mixed account; see Goldman 2012a).\nHere is one plausible definition:\n\n\n(RES+REU) Token state M* is a mental simulation of token state\nM if and only if:\n\n Both M and M* are mental states\n M* resembles M in some significant respects\n M is generated by token cognitive process P\n M* is generated by token cognitive process P*\n P is implemented by the use of a token cognitive\nmechanism of type C\n P* is implemented by the reuse of a token\ncognitive mechanism of type C\n\n\n\nRES+REU has at least three important virtues. The first is\nthat it solves all the aforementioned problems for RES and\n REU\u2014we\n leave to the reader the exercise of showing that this is indeed the\ncase.\n\nThe second is that it fits nicely with an idea that loomed\nlarge in the simulationist literature: the idea that simulated\nmental states are \u201cpretend\u201d (\u201cas if\u201d,\n\u201cquasi-\u201d) states\u2014imperfect copies of, surrogates\nfor, the \u201cgenuine\u201d states normally produced by a certain\ncognitive mechanism, obtained by taking this cognitive mechanism\n\u201coff-line\u201d. Consider the following case. Frank is in front\nof Central Caf\u00e9 (and believes that he is\nthere). He desires to drink a beer and believes that\nhe can buy one at Central Caf\u00e9. When he feeds these\nmental states into his decision-making mechanism, the mechanism\nimplements a decision-making process, which outputs the\ndecision to enter the caf\u00e9. In this case,\nFrank\u2019s decision-making mechanism was\n\u201con-line\u201d\u2014i.e., he used it; he employed it\nfor its primary function. My situation is different. I don\u2019t\nbelieve I am in front of Central Caf\u00e9, nor do I desire\nto drink a beer right now. Still, I can imagine believing and desiring\nso. When I feed these imagined states into my decision-making\nmechanism, I am not employing it for its primary function. Rather, I\nam taking it off-line (I am reusing it). As a result, the\ncognitive process implemented by my mechanism will output a merely\nimagined decision to enter the caf\u00e9. Now, it seems fair to\nsay that my imagined decision resembles Frank\u2019s decision (more\non this in\n section 3).\n If you combine this with how these two mental states have been\ngenerated, the result is that my imagined decision is a mental\nsimulation of Frank\u2019s decision, and thus it is a simulated\nmental state. It is also clear why Frank\u2019s decision is\ngenuine, while my simulated mental state is just a\npretend decision: all else being equal, Frank\u2019s\ndecision to enter Central Caf\u00e9 will cause him to enter\nthe caf\u00e9; on the contrary, no such behaviour will result from\nmy simulated decision. I have not really decided so. Mine was\njust a quasi-decision\u2014an imperfect copy of, a surrogate\nfor, Frank\u2019s genuine decision.\n\nAnd here is\n RES+REU\u2019s\n third virtue. So far, we have said that \u201cmental\nsimulation\u201d can either pick out a dyadic relation between mental\nstates or a monadic property of mental states. In fact, its ambiguity\nruns deeper than this, since philosophers and cognitive scientists\nalso use \u201cmental simulation\u201d to refer to a monadic\nproperty of cognitive processes, namely, the property\nbeing a (mental) simulation process (or: \u201cprocess of\nmental simulation\u201d, \u201csimulational process\u201d,\n\u201csimulative process\u201d, etc.) As a first stab, a (mental)\nsimulation process is a cognitive process generating simulated mental\nstates.\n RES+REU\n has the resources to capture this usage of \u201cmental\nsimulation\u201d too. Indeed,\n RES+REU\nimplicitly contains the following definition of\n\u201csimulation process\u201d:\n\n\n(PROC): Token process P* is a (mental) simulation process if\nand only if:\n\n P* generates token state M*\n M* resembles another token state, M, in some\nsignificant respects\n Both M and M* are mental states\n M is generated by token process P\n Both P and P* are cognitive processes\n P is implemented by the use of a token cognitive\nmechanism of type C\n P* is implemented by the reuse of a token\ncognitive mechanism of type C\n\n\n\nGo back to the case in which Lisa was having a visual experience of a\nyellow banana, while I was having a visual image of a yellow banana.\nOur two mental states resembled one another, but different cognitive\nprocesses generated them: seeing in Lisa\u2019s case, and\nvisualizing in my case. Moreover, Lisa\u2019s\nseeing was implemented by the use of the visual mechanism,\nwhile my visualizing was implemented by its reuse. According\nto PROC, the latter cognitive process, but not the former, was thus a\nsimulation process.\n\nTo sum up,\n RES+REU\n captures many of the crucial features that Simulation Theorists\nascribe to mental simulation. For this reason, we shall adopt it as\nour working definition of \u201cmental simulation\nof\u201d\u2014consequently, we shall adopt PROC as a definition of\n\u201csimulated mental\n state\u201d.[2]\n We can put this into a diagram.\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nThe hexagon at the bottom depicts a cognitive mechanism C (it\ncould be, say, the visual mechanism). When C is used (arrow on\nthe left), it implements cognitive process P (say, seeing);\nwhen it is re-used (arrow on the right), it implements cognitive\nprocess P* (say, visualizing). P generates mental state\nM (say, a visual experience of a red tomato), while P*\ngenerates mental state M* (say, a visual image of a red\ntomato). These two mental states (M and M*) resemble one\nanother. Given this: M* is a mental simulation of\nM; M* is a simulated mental state; and\nP* is a simulation\n process.[3]\n",
