    "main_text": "Democracy and Free Speech || Democratic Citizenship and Pornography\n4.1 Democratic Citizenship and Pornography\n\nVery few, if any, liberal democracies are willing to support the\nMillian view that only speech causing direct harm to rights should be\nprohibited. Most support some form of the offense principle. Some\nliberal philosophers are willing to extend the realm of state\ninterference further and argue that hate speech should be banned even\nif it does not cause harm or unavoidable offense. The reason it should\nbe banned is that it is inconsistent with the underlying values of\nliberal democracy to brand some citizens as inferior on the grounds of\nrace, religion, gender or sexual orientation. The same applies to\npornography; it should be prevented because it is incompatible with\ndemocratic citizenship to portray women as submissive sexual objects,\nwho seem to enjoy being violently mistreated. Rae Langton, for\nexample, starts from the liberal premise of equal concern and respect\nand concludes that it is justifiable to remove certain speech\nprotections for pornographers. She avoids basing her argument on harm:\n\u201cIf, for example, there were conclusive evidence linking\npornography to violence, one could simply justify a prohibitive\nstrategy on the basis of the harm principle. However, the prohibitive\narguments advanced in this article do not require empirical premises\nas strong as this\u2026they rely instead on the notion of\nequality\u201d (1990, 313).\n\nWorking within the framework of arguments supplied by Ronald Dworkin,\nwho is opposed to prohibitive measures, she tries to demonstrate that\negalitarian liberals such as Dworkin should support the prohibition of\npornography. She suggests that we have \u201creason to be concerned\nabout pornography, not because it is morally suspect, but because we\ncare about equality and the rights of women\u201d (1990, 311).\nLangton concludes that \u201cwomen as a group have rights against the\nproducers and consumers of pornography, and thereby have rights that\nare trumps against the policy of permitting pornography\u2026the\npermissive policy is in conflict with the principle of equal concern\nand respect, and that women accordingly have rights against it\u201d\n(1990, 346). Because she is not basing her argument on the harm\nprinciple, she does not have to show that women are harmed by\npornography. For the argument to be persuasive, however, one has to\naccept that permitting pornography does mean that women are not\ntreated with equal concern and respect. It also seems that the\nargument can be applied to non-pornagraphic material that portrays\nwomen in a demeaning way that undermines their status as equals. \n",
