Prereflective self-consciousness\n\nOne can get a bearing on the notion of prereflective\nself-consciousness by contrasting it with reflective\nself-consciousness. If you ask me to give you a description of the\npain I feel in my right foot, or of what I was just thinking about, I\nwould reflect on it and thereby take up a certain perspective that was\none order removed from the pain or the thought. Thus, reflective\nself-consciousness is at least a second-order cognition. It may be the\nbasis for a report on one\u2019s experience, although not all reports\ninvolve a significant amount of reflection.\n\nIn contrast, prereflective self-consciousness is pre-reflective in the\nsense that (1) it is an awareness we have before we do any reflecting\non our experience; (2) it is an implicit and first-order awareness\nrather than an explicit or higher-order form of self-consciousness.\nIndeed, an explicit reflective self-consciousness is possible only\nbecause there is a prereflective self-awareness that is an on-going\nand more primary kind of self-consciousness. Although phenomenologists\ndo not always agree on important questions about method, focus, or\neven whether there is an ego or self, they are in close to unanimous\nagreement about the idea that the experiential dimension always\ninvolves such an implicit prereflective self-consciousness. In line\nwith Edmund Husserl (1959, 189, 412), who maintains that consciousness\nalways involves a self-appearance\n(F\u00fcr-sich-selbst-erscheinens), and in agreement with\nMichel Henry (1963, 1965), who notes that experience is always\nself-manifesting, and with Maurice Merleau-Ponty who states that\nconsciousness is always given to itself and that the word\n\u2018consciousness\u2019 has no meaning independently of this\nself-givenness (Merleau-Ponty 1945, 488), Jean-Paul Sartre writes that\nprereflective self-consciousness is not simply a quality added to the\nexperience, an accessory; rather, it constitutes the very mode of\nbeing of the experience:\n\nThis self-consciousness we ought to consider not as a new\nconsciousness, but as the only mode of existence which is possible\nfor a consciousness of something (Sartre 1943, 20 [1956, liv]).\n\n\nWe find the same view, to mention just one more thinker, in Roman\nIngarden, who writes that I don\u2019t need any kind of introspection\nor reflection in order to gain acquaintance with my experiential life\nsince the first-order experience is already characterized by a\nparticular kind of conscious self-penetration (Ingarden 1992,\n155\u2013156). And as he then points out, the original mode of being of\nconscious life is precisely to be in the form of being self-conscious.\nIn the absence of such self-consciousness, an experience would not be\nan experience (Ingarden 1992, 156). In short, unless a mental process\nis prereflectively self-conscious there will be nothing it is like to\nundergo the process, and it therefore cannot be a phenomenally\nconscious process (Zahavi 1999, 2005, 2014). An implication of this is\nobviously that the self-consciousness in question is so fundamental\nand basic that it can be ascribed to all creatures that are\nphenomenally conscious, including various non-human animals.\n\nAs just noted, the notion of prereflective self-consciousness is\nrelated to the idea that experiences have a subjective\n\u2018feel\u2019 to them, a certain (phenomenal) quality of\n\u2018what it is like\u2019 or what it \u2018feels\u2019 like to\nhave them. As it is usually expressed outside of phenomenological\ntexts, to undergo a conscious experience necessarily means that there\nis something it is like for the subject to have that experience (Nagel\n1974; Searle 1992). This is obviously true of bodily sensations like\npain. But it is also the case for perceptual experiences, experiences\nof desiring, feeling, and thinking. There is something it is like to\ntaste chocolate, and this is different from what it is like to\nremember or imagine what it is like to taste chocolate, or to smell\nvanilla, to run, to stand still, to feel envious, nervous, depressed\nor happy, or to entertain an abstract belief.\n\nAll of these different experiences are, moreover, also characterized\nby their distinct first-personal character. The what-it-is-likeness of\nphenomenal episodes is properly speaking a\nwhat-it-is-like-for-me-ness. This for-me-ness doesn\u2019t\nrefer to a specific experiential quality like sour or soft, rather it\nrefers to the distinct first-personal givenness of experience. It\nrefers to the fact that the experiences I am living through are given\ndifferently (but not necessarily better) to me than to anybody else. I\nmay see that you are sad, but my seeing your sadness is qualitatively\ndifferent from my living through my sadness. It could consequently be\nclaimed that anybody who denies the for-me-ness of experience simply\nfails to recognize an essential constitutive aspect of experience.\nSuch a denial would be tantamount to a denial of the first-person\nperspective. It would entail the view that my own mind is either not\ngiven to me at all\u2014I would be mind- or self-blind\u2014or is\npresented to me in exactly the same way as the minds of others.\n\nWe can distinguish two uses of the term \u2018conscious\u2019, a\ntransitive and an intransitive use. On the one hand, we can speak of\nour being conscious of something, be it x, y, or\nz. On the other, we can speak of our being conscious\nsimpliciter (rather than non-conscious). For some time a\nwidespread way to account for intransitive consciousness in cognitive\nscience and analytic philosophy of mind has been by means of some kind\nof higher-order theory. The distinction between conscious and\nnon-conscious mental states has been taken to rest upon the presence\nor absence of a relevant meta-mental state (e.g., Armstrong 1968;\nCarruthers 1996, 2000; Lycan 1987, 1996; Rosenthal 1997). Thus,\nintransitive consciousness has been taken to depend upon the mind\ndirecting its intentional aim at its own states and operations. As\nPeter Carruthers puts it, the subjective feel of experience\npresupposes a capacity for higher-order awareness: \u201csuch\nself-awareness is a conceptually necessary condition for an organism\nto be a subject of phenomenal feelings, or for there to be anything\nthat its experiences are like\u201d (1996, 152). But for Carruthers,\nthe self-awareness in question is a type of reflection. In his view, a\ncreature must be capable of reflecting upon, thinking about, and hence\nconceptualizing its own mental states if those mental states are to be\nstates of which the creature is aware (1996, 155, 157).\n\nOne might share the view that there is a close link between\nconsciousness and self-consciousness and still disagree about the\nnature of the link. And although the phenomenological view might\nsuperficially resemble the view of the higher-order theories, we are\nultimately confronted with two quite different accounts. The\nphenomenologists explicitly deny that the self-consciousness that is\npresent the moment I consciously experience something is to be\nunderstood in terms of some kind of higher-order monitoring. Rather\nthan involving an additional mental state, it should rather to be\nunderstood as an intrinsic feature of the primary experience. That is,\nin contrast to higher-order accounts of consciousness that claim that\nconsciousness is an extrinsic or relational property of those mental\nstates that have it, a property bestowed upon them from without by\nsome further state, the phenomenologists would typically argue that\nthe feature in virtue of which a mental state is conscious is an\nintrinsic property of those mental states that have it. Moreover, the\nphenomenologists also reject the attempt to construe intransitive\nconsciousness in terms of transitive consciousness, that is, they\nreject the view that a conscious state is a state we are conscious of\nas object. To put it differently, not only do they reject the view\nthat a mental state becomes conscious by being taken as an object by a\nhigher-order state, they also reject the view (generally associated\nwith Brentano) according to which a mental state becomes conscious by\ntaking itself as an object (cf. Zahavi 2004; 2014).\n\nThat prereflective self-consciousness is implicit, then, means that I\nam not confronted with a thematic or explicit awareness of the\nexperience as belonging to myself. Rather we are dealing with a\nnon-observational self-acquaintance. Here is how Heidegger and Sartre\nput the point:\n\nDasein [human existence] as existing, is there for itself, even when\nthe ego does not expressly direct itself to itself in the manner of\nits own peculiar turning around and turning back, which in\nphenomenology is called inner perception as contrasted with outer. The\nself is there for the Dasein itself without reflection and without\ninner perception, before all reflection. Reflection, in the\nsense of a turning back, is only a mode of self-apprehension,\nbut not the mode of primary self-disclosure (Heidegger 1989, 226\n[1982, 159]).\n\nIn other words, every positional consciousness of an object is at the\nsame time a non-positional consciousness of itself. If I count the\ncigarettes which are in that case, I have the impression of disclosing\nan objective property of this collection of cigarettes: they are a\ndozen. This property appears to my consciousness as a property\nexisting in the world. It is very possible that I have no positional\nconsciousness of counting them. Then I do not know myself as counting.\nYet at the moment when these cigarettes are revealed to me as a dozen,\nI have a non-thetic consciousness of my adding activity. If anyone\nquestioned me, indeed, if anyone should ask, \u201cWhat are you doing\nthere?\u201d I should reply at once, \u201cI am counting.\u201d\n(Sartre 1943, 19\u201320 [1956, liii]).\n\nWhat arguments support the phenomenological claims, however?\nPhenomenologists don\u2019t simply appeal to a correct\nphenomenological description but provide additional, more theoretical,\narguments. One line of reasoning found in virtually all of the\nphenomenologists is the view that the attempt to let (intransitive)\nconsciousness be a result of a higher-order monitoring will generate\nan infinite regress. On the face of it, this is a rather old idea.\nTypically, the regress argument has been understood in the following\nmanner. If all occurrent mental states are conscious in the sense of\nbeing taken as objects by occurrent second-order mental states, then\nthese second-order mental states must themselves be taken as objects\nby occurrent third-order mental states, and so forth ad\ninfinitum. The standard response to this objection is that the\nregress can easily be avoided by accepting the existence of\nnon-conscious mental states. This is precisely the position adopted by\nthe defenders of higher-order theory. For them a second-order\nperception or thought does not have to be conscious. It would be\nconscious only if accompanied by a (non-conscious) third-order thought\nor perception (Rosenthal 1997, 745). The phenomenological reply to\nthis solution is rather straightforward, however. The phenomenologists\nwould concede that it is possible to halt the regress by postulating\nthe existence of non-conscious mental states, but they would maintain\nthat such an appeal to the non-conscious leaves us with a case of\nexplanatory vacuity. That is, they would find it quite unclear why the\nrelation between two otherwise non-conscious mental processes should\nmake one of them conscious. Or to put it differently, they would be\nquite unconvinced by the claim that a state without subjective or\nphenomenal qualities can be transformed into one with such qualities,\ni.e., into an experience with first-personal character, by the mere\naddition of a non-conscious meta-state having the first-state as its\nintentional object.\n\nThe phenomenological alternative avoids both vacuity and regress. As\nSartre writes: \u201c[T]here is no infinite regress here, since a\nconsciousness has no need at all of a reflecting [higher-order]\nconsciousness in order to be conscious of itself. It simply does not\nposit itself as an object\u201d (1936, 29 [1957, 45]). That is,\nprereflective self-consciousness is not transitive in relation to the\nstate (of) which it is aware. It is, as Sartre puts it, the mode of\nexistence of consciousness itself. This does not mean that a\nhigher-order meta-consciousness is impossible, but merely that it\nalways presupposes the existence of a prior non-objectifying,\nprereflective self-consciousness as its condition of possibility. To\nquote Sartre again, \u201cit is the non-reflective consciousness\nwhich renders the reflection [and any higher-order representation of\nit] possible\u201d (1943, 20 [1956, liii]).\n\nThere are also lines of argumentation in contemporary analytical\nphilosophy of mind that are close to and consistent with the\nphenomenological conception of prereflective self-consciousness.\nConsider for instance the following quotes from Alvin Goldman and\nHarry Frankfurt:\n\n[Consider] the case of thinking about x or attending to\nx. In the process of thinking about x there is\nalready an implicit awareness that one is thinking about x.\nThere is no need for reflection here, for taking a step back from\nthinking about x in order to examine it\u2026When we are\nthinking about x, the mind is focused on x, not on\nour thinking of x. Nevertheless, the process of thinking\nabout x carries with it a non-reflective self-awareness\n(Goldman 1970, 96).\n\n\n\nAn instance of exclusively primary and unreflexive consciousness would\nnot be an instance of what we ordinarily think of as consciousness at\nall. For what would it be like to be conscious of something without\nbeing aware of this consciousness? It would mean having an experience\nwith no awareness whatever of its occurrence. This would be,\nprecisely, a case of unconscious experience. It appears, then, that\nbeing conscious is identical with being self-conscious. Consciousness\nis self-consciousness. The claim that waking consciousness is\nself-consciousness does not mean that consciousness is invariably dual\nin the sense that every instance of it involves both a primary\nawareness and another instance of consciousness which is somehow\ndistinct and separable from the first and which has the first as its\nobject. That would threaten an intolerably infinite proliferation of\ninstances of consciousness. Rather, the self-consciousness in question\nis a sort of immanent reflexivity by virtue of which every\ninstance of being conscious grasps not only that of which it is an\nawareness but also the awareness of it. It is like a source of light\nwhich, in addition to illuminating whatever other things fall within\nits scope, renders itself visible as well (Frankfurt 1988,\n161\u2013162).\n\n\nA related view has been defended by Owen Flanagan, who not only argues\nthat consciousness involves self-consciousness in the weak sense that\nthere is something it is like for the subject to have the experience,\nbut also speaks of the low-level self-consciousness involved in\nexperiencing my experiences as mine (Flanagan 1992, 194). As Flanagan\nquite correctly points out, this primary type of self-consciousness\nshould not be confused with the much stronger notion of\nself-consciousness that is in play when we are thinking about our own\nnarrative self. The latter form of reflective self-consciousness\npresupposes both conceptual knowledge and narrative competence. It\nrequires maturation and socialization, and the ability to access and\nissue reports about the states, traits, dispositions that make one the\nperson one is. Other philosophers who have defended comparable views,\ninclude Jos\u00e9 Luis Berm\u00fadez (1998), who has argued that\nthat there are a variety of nonconceptual forms of self-consciousness\nthat are \u201clogically and ontogenetically more primitive than the\nhigher forms of self-consciousness that are usually the focus of\nphilosophical debate\u201d (1998, 274), and Uriah Kriegel (2009) who\nhas argued that there is a type of self-consciousness that is\nintrinsic to and inherent in phenomenal consciousness. We will return\nto Kriegel\u2019s self-representationalism in a section 2. Across a\nvariety of philosophical studies, then, one finds support for the\nphenomenological conception of prereflective self-consciousness.\n",
