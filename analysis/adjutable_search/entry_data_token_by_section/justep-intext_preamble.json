    "main_text": "\n\nGenerally, when a person knows some proposition or other, she does so\non the basis of something such as evidence, or good reasons, or\nperhaps some experiences she has had. The same is true of justified\nbeliefs that may fall short of knowledge. These beliefs are justified\non the basis of some evidence, or good reasons, or experiences, or\nmaybe on the basis of the manner in which the beliefs were\nproduced.\n\nInternalism in the first instance is a thesis about the basis of\neither knowledge or justified belief. This first form of internalism\nholds that a person either does or can have a form of access\nto the basis for knowledge or justified belief. The key idea is that\nthe person either is or can be aware of this basis. Externalists, by\ncontrast, deny that one always can have this sort of access to the\nbasis for one's knowledge and justified belief. A second form of\ninternalism, connected just to justified belief but probably\nextendable to knowledge as well, concerns not access but rather what\nthe basis for a justified belief really is. Mentalism is the thesis\nthat what ultimately justifies any belief is some mental state of the\nepistemic agent holding that belief. Externalism on this dimension,\nthen, would be the view that things other than mental states operate\nas justifiers. A third form of internalism concerns the very concept\nof justification, rather than access to or the nature of justifiers.\nThis third form of internalism is the deontological concept of\njustification, whose main idea is that the concept of epistemic\njustification is to be analyzed in terms of fulfilling one's\nintellectual duties or responsibilities. Externalism with respect to\nthe concept of epistemic justification would be the thesis that this\nconcept is to be analyzed in terms other than special duties or\nresponsibilities.\n",
