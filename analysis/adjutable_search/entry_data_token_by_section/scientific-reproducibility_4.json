    "main_text": "Meta-Science: Establishing, Monitoring, and Evaluating the Reproducibility Crisis\n2. Meta-Science: Establishing, Monitoring, and Evaluating the Reproducibility Crisis\n\nIn psychology, the origin of the reproducibility crisis is often\nlinked to Daryl Bem\u2019s (2011) paper which reported empirical\nevidence for the existence of \u201cpsi\u201d, otherwise known as\nExtra Sensory Perception (ESP). This paper passed through the standard\npeer review process and was published in the high impact Journal\nof Personality and Social Psychology. The controversial nature of\nthe findings inspired three independent replication studies, each of\nwhich failed to reproduce Bem\u2019s results. However, these\nreplication studies were rejected from four different journals,\nincluding the journal that had originally published Bem\u2019s study,\non the grounds that the replications were not original or novel\nresearch. They were eventually published in PLoS ONE\n(Ritchie, Wiseman, & French 2012). This created controversy in the\nfield, and was interpreted by many as demonstrating how publication\nbias impeded science\u2019s self-correction mechanism. In medicine,\nthe origin of the crisis is often attributed to Ioannidis\u2019\n(2005) paper \u201cWhy most published findings are false\u201d. The\npaper offered formal arguments about inflated rates of false positives\nin the literature\u2014where a \u201cfalse positive\u201d result\nclaims a relationship exists between phenomena when it in fact does\nnot (e.g., a claim that consuming a drug is correlated with symptom\nrelief when it in fact is not). Ioannidis\u2019 (2005) also reported\nvery low (11%) empirical reproducibility rates from a set of\npre-clinical trial replications at Amgen, later independently\npublished by Begley and Ellis (2012). In all disciplines, the\nreplication crisis is also more generally linked to earlier criticisms\nof Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (e.g., Szucs & Ioannidis\n2017), which pointed out the neglect of statistical power (e.g., Cohen\n1962, 1994) and a failure to adequately distinguish statistical and\nsubstantive hypotheses (e.g., Meehl 1967, 1978). This is discussed\nfurther below.\n\nIn response to the events above, a new field identifying as\nmeta-science (or meta-research) has become\nestablished over the last decade (Munaf\u00f2 et al. 2017).\nMunaf\u00f2 et al. define meta-science as \u201cthe scientific\nstudy of science itself\u201d (2017: 1). In October 2015, Ioannidis,\nFanelli, Dunne, and Goodman identified over 800 meta-science papers\npublished in the five-month period from January to May that year, and\nestimated that the relevant literature was accruing at the rate of\napproximately 2,000 papers each year. Referring to the same bodies of\nwork with slightly different terms, Ioannidis et al. define\n\u201cmeta-research\u201d as \n\n\nan evolving scientific discipline that aims to evaluate and improve\nresearch practices. It includes thematic areas of methods, reporting,\nreproducibility, evaluation, and incentives (how to do, report,\nverify, correct, and reward science). (2015: 1) \n\n\nMultiple research centres dedicated to this work now exist, including,\nfor example, the Tilburg University Meta-Research Center in\npsychology, the Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford (METRICS),\nand others listed in Ioannidis et al. 2015 (see\n Other Internet Resources).\n Relevant research in medical fields is also covered in Stegenga\n2018.\n\nProjects that self-identify as meta-science or meta-research\ninclude:\n\nLarge, crowd-sourced, direct (or close) replication projects such\nas The Reproducibility Projects in Psychology (OSC 2015) and Cancer\nBiology (Errington et al. 2014) and the Many Labs projects in\npsychology (e.g., Klein et al. 2014);\nComputational reproducibility projects, that is, redoing analysis\nusing the same original data set (e.g., Chang & Li 2015);\nBibliographic studies documenting the extent of publication bias\nin different scientific fields and changes over time (e.g., Fanelli\n2010a, 2010b, 2012);\nSurveys of the use of Questionable Research Practices (QRPs)\namongst researchers and their impact on the publication literature\n(e.g., John, Loewenstein, & Prelec 2012; Fiedler & Schwarz\n2016; Agnoli et al. 2017; Fraser et al. 2018);\nSurveys of the completeness, correctness and transparency of\nmethods and analysis reporting in scientific journals (e.g., Nuijten\net al. 2016; Bakker & Wicherts 2011; Cumming et al. 2007; Fidler\net al. 2006);\nSurvey and interview studies of researchers\u2019 understanding\nof core methodological and statistical concepts, and real and\nperceived obstacles to improving practices (Bakker et al. 2016;\nWashburn et al. 2018; Allen, Dorozenko, & Roberts 2016);\nEvaluation of incentives to change behaviour, thereby improving\nreproducibility and encouraging more open practices (e.g., Kidwell et\nal. 2016).\n\n",
