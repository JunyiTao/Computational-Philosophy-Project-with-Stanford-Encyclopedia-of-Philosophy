    "main_text": "Applications || Characterizing Physicalism\n5.4 Characterizing Physicalism\n\nRoughly speaking, physicalism is the view that somehow or other,\neverything is settled by the physical. This is of course vague along a\nnumber of dimensions. One question, beyond the scope of this essay, is\nwhat exactly \u2018physical\u2019 means (see Stoljar\u2019s entry\non physicalism). Another question is about the scope of the\nquantifier: should it really range over everything, or should the\nthesis be restricted to the mental (thus leaving room for non-physical\nentities like platonic numbers, abstract universals, or God)? While\nthe sociological question of which of these theses is usually intended\nis also beyond the scope of this essay, the distinction will appear\nagain. And a third question is what exactly \u2018settled by\u2019\nmeans. \n\nThis last question is the relevant one here, because for a roughly 30\nyear period beginning with Davidson\u2019s \u201cMental Events\u201d\n(1970, 214), philosophers used supervenience as a placeholder for the\nneeded relation. That is, physicalism was regularly characterized as\nthe view that everything\u2014or perhaps just the\nmental\u2014supervenes on the physical. More specifically, it was\nfrequently characterized as a i) metaphysically necessary ii) strong\nglobal supervenience thesis that is iii) restricted to only a certain\nrange of worlds. We shall say a bit about each in turn, before\nmentioning the more recent turn to instead characterizing physicalism\nin terms of grounding.\n5.4.1 Why say that the thesis is metaphysically necessary?\n\nPhysicalists take the supervenience thesis to hold with metaphysical\nnecessity, because a merely nomologically necessary supervenience\nthesis is compatible with dualism. Dualists can maintain that there\nare fundamental psychophysical laws that maintain the supervenience\nconnection (McLaughlin 1992, Chalmers 1996). Since no physicalist will\nagree, capturing physicalism requires a supervenience thesis that\nholds with full-blown metaphysical necessity. \n5.4.2 Why use strong global supervenience?\n\nPhysicalism is characterized in terms of global supervenience as\nopposed to individual supervenience because an individual\u2019s mental\nstates do not locally supervene on her intrinsic brain states for\nreasons that do not impugn physicalism as intuitively understood.\nNotably, the contents of her propositional attitudes depend upon the\nsurrounding environment if any kind of externalism is true (See Putnam\n1975 and the entry on externalism). \n\nBut why strong global supervenience instead of one of the weaker two\nvarieties, intermediate or weak (see\n 4.3.2)?\n The answer is that neither of those is strong enough. An intermediate\nglobal supervenience thesis would allow a world physically\nindiscernible from this one, in which precisely the same mental\nproperties are instantiated as are instantiated here, but in which\nphysically indiscernible individuals swap mental lives. A weak global\nsupervenience characterization of physicalism would go further. It\nwould allow a world physically indiscernible from this one, in which\nprecisely the same mental properties are instantiated as are\ninstantiated here, but in which they are differently distributed among\nentities without any restriction. For example, a weak global\nsupervenience characterization of physicalism is compatible with the\nexistence of a world physically indiscernible from this one in which\nTaylor Swift and Peter Singer exchange mental lives (see\n 4.3.5).\n Physicalism should not allow either sort of mental property\nswapping.\n5.4.3 Why restrict the thesis to a certain range of worlds?\n\nStill, physicalism cannot just be the thesis that the mental facts (or\nall the facts) strongly globally supervenience with\nlogical/metaphysical necessity on the physical facts and laws, because\nmany physicalists want to allow for the metaphysical possibility of\nthings like ghosts or Cartesian souls. They think that there actually\naren\u2019t any such things, not that there could not be any, nor\neven that there could not be any compatibly with the physical facts of\nour world. They thus do in fact allow that two worlds could be\nphysical duplicates but differ mentally, in virtue of only one of them\ncontaining disembodied spirits, say. (Note that because the worlds are\nphysical duplicates, those spirits either exert no causal influence on\nthe physical at all, or else only exert redundant,\n\u2018overdeterministic\u2019 causal influence on the physical.)\n\nVarious philosophers have offered various ways of defining physicalism\nto allow for this possibility, while continuing to rely upon global\nsupervenience. The key in all cases is to limit the range of worlds in\nwhich the global supervenience thesis holds. For example, David Lewis\ntook physicalism to be the claim that\n\nAmong worlds where no natural properties alien to our world are\ninstantiated, no two differ without differing physically; any two such\nworlds that are exactly alike physically are duplicates (Lewis 1983b,\n364).\n Jackson offers the following:\n\n\nAny world which is a minimal physical duplicate of our world is a\nduplicate simpliciter (Jackson, 1998, 12).\n\n\nwhere a minimal physical duplicate is what results from duplicating\nall the physical facts and \u201cstopping right there.\u201d And David\nChalmers says that physicalism is true in a world w just in case every\npositive fact that obtains in w also obtains in any world physically\nindiscernible from w (1996, 39\u201340). Each of these three\ndefinitions allows for worlds in which physicalism fails: worlds that\nare physical duplicates of the actual world, and in which there are\nghosts or souls.\n5.4.4 Beyond supervenience physicalism \n\nUnfortunately, even these sophisticated supervenience formulations\nfail to provide an adequate characterization of physicalism. There are\nat least three reasons for this failure, and necessarily existing\nentities or necessarily obtaining facts generate not one but two of\nthem. \n\nRecall that necessary beings (whether entities, facts, or whatever)\nsupervene on anything whatsoever, for the simple reason that such\nthings exist in every world. Because no two worlds can differ in\nwhether they exist, full stop, no two worlds can differ in whether\nthey exist without differing in x, for whatever x\nyou like (see\n section 3.5).\n \n\nThe first problem that necessary beings pose is only a problem for\nwide scope physicalism, the version of the view that says that truly\neverything, not just the mental facts, supervenes on the physical\nfacts. The difficulty is that some putative necessarily existing\nthings, like Platonic numbers or God, do not seem physicalistically\nkosher. Yet their actual existence is compatible with a global\nsupervenience formulation of physicalism.\n\nThe second problem is a problem for both wide scope physicalism and a\nnarrower version only about the mental. As discussed in\n section 3.5),\n the fact that necessarily existing things supervene on anything\nwhatsoever shows that supervenience is not ontological dependence or\ndetermination. After all, the putative fact that God exists globally\nsupervenes on the fact that my cat is named Snoop without the former\nin any way depending on the latter. This is supervenience on the\ncheap, not anything strong enough for physicalism. (For other putative\ncounterexamples to the sufficiency of the supervenience thesis, see\nWitmer 1999 and Hawthorne 2002.)\n\nThe third issue is closely related to the second, though it doesn\u2019t\nturn on necessary existence in particular. It is that many think the\ncorrect statement of physicalism should be in some way explanatory in\na way that the bare supervenience claim is not. One version of this is\nto say that physicalism should say that the physical facts explain the\nmental ones. The supervenience claim alone says no such thing, as\nshown by the case of necessary existents as well as the case of\nproperties supervening on their negations. A different version of this\nis to say that physicalism requires\n\u2018superdupervenience\u2019\u2014that physicalism should explain\nwhy the relevant global supervenience theses holds (see Blackburn\n1984, Horgan 1993, Melnyk 2003, and Wilson 2005). Concerns like these\nshould be familiar from sections\n 3.5\n and\n 3.7).\n \n\nSome think that these concerns can be avoided by moving from\ncharacterizing physicalism in terms of supervenience to characterizing\nphysicalism in terms of grounding (e.g. Rosen 2010, 111; Dasgupta\n2014, 557; Schaffer 2017, section 4). Because grounding is supposed to\nbe hyperintensional, it is not the case that necessary beings or facts\nare grounded by just anything. And grounding is supposed to back\nexplanations as well.\n\nHowever, whether the appeal to grounding really advances anything is a\nmatter of dispute (Wilson 2016). See Stoljar\u2019s entry on physicalism\nfor further discussion. Further, note that we have only raised\nchallenges for the claim that a strong global supervenience thesis is\nsufficient for physicalism. It remains open that some such\nthesis is necessary for physicalism. If it is, then grounding\nphysicalism needs to entail supervenience physicalism. (For\nconsiderations against, see Skiles 2014; for considerations in favor,\nsee Bennett 2017, 3.3.) And if it is, physicalism would remain\ntestable by exposing it to would-be arguments by appeal to FISTS, such\nas the zombie argument. \n5.5 Coincident Entities and the \u201cGrounding Problem\u201d\n\nIt is fairly widely held that more than one object can occupy the same\nspatio-temporal location. Such objects are said to be\nspatio-temporally coincident. The classic example is a statue,\nGoliath, and the lump of clay that constitutes it, Lumpl (see Gibbard\n1975). On one version of the story, Lumpl sits around on a shelf for a\nfew days before the sculptor shapes it into Goliath on a Thursday\nmorning. It looks like Lumpl existed on the previous Wednesday and\nthat Goliath did not, and consequently looks like Leibniz\u2019s Law\nentails that they are distinct objects. On another version of the\nstory, Lumpl and Goliath are created and destroyed at precisely the\nsame moment. Here the two do not have different temporal properties,\nbut they do have different modal ones\u2014Lumpl would still\nexist if we squashed it into a ball, but Goliath would not. Again,\nLeibniz\u2019s Law apparently entails that they are distinct. (See\nRea 1997a for many interesting papers on this issue.)\n\nThe main objection to the view that Goliath and Lumpl are distinct is\nwhat can be called \u2018the grounding problem\u2019. How can Lumpl\nand Goliath differ in their modal properties, given that they are\nalike in every other way? What grounds their difference in\npersistence conditions? In virtue of what do they have the persistence\nconditions they do?\n\nThe grounding problem is sometimes characterized in terms of\nsupervenience failure. Lumpl and Goliath differ in their persistence\nconditions without differing in their physical or categorical\nproperties (see Yablo 1987 for a discussion of categoricity). And it\nis true that many forms of supervenience fail: weak and strong\nindividual supervenience and strong global supervenience all fail. But\nthere are forms of supervenience that can hold. Both weak and\nintermediate global supervenience hold, as does (as the name suggests)\ncoincidence-friendly supervenience, and possibly other versions of\nmultiple-domain supervenience (c.f. Zimmerman 1995, Rea 1997b, Sider\n1999, Baker 2000). All of these forms hold on the plausible assumption\nthat any two regions physically/categorically just like this one will\ncontain an object with Goliath\u2019s persistence conditions, and an\nobject with Lumpl\u2019s persistence conditions.\n\nBut the crucial question is not whether any form of supervenience\nholds, but rather whether those that hold constitute a satisfactory\nanswer to the grounding problem. For a defense of the positive answer,\nsee Sider 1999; for a defense of the negative answer, see Bennett\n2004b. For a new take, see Sider 2008. ",
