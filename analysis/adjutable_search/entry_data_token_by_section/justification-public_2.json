    "main_text": "The Public Justification Principle || \u201cSufficient\u201d Reasons\n2.1 \u201cSufficient\u201d Reasons\n\nThe PJP requires that members of a public \\(P\\) have reason to endorse\na principle \\(L\\). One must then explain what it means to \u201chave\na reason to endorse\u201d \\(L\\).\n\nA common approach to reasons in normative ethics is to take the idea\nof a reason as primitive. A reason to \\(\\Phi\\) is a consideration that\ncounts in favor of \\(\\Phi\\)-ing (Scanlon 1998, 17). But the idea of a\nreason in public justification theory is more specific. We do not need\nan ontology of reasons, but we must explain when a reason\njustifies a proposal. Gaus defends a conception of reasons on\nepistemic grounds in Justificatory Liberalism. One has a\njustificatory reason when openly justified. A reason is\nopenly justified when it is \u201cstable in the face of acute and\nsustained criticism by others and of new information\u201d (Gaus\n1996, 31).\n\nA reason is sufficient when it has some positive epistemic grounds.\nSome considerations favor it, and none defeat it. Critically, a reason\ncan be sufficient for one member of the public but not others. So, a\njustifying reason may not justify coercion for all members of the\npublic. A coercive law is only justified when each person has\nsufficient reason to endorse \\(L\\). Laws gain public justification by\nresting on the sufficient reasons of each member.\n\nPublic justification theorists assume that our personal reasons for\naction and belief can differ, and in some cases, substantially. The\nreasons one may offer in public justification may be narrower than\none\u2019s personal reasons, but even consensus theorists think that\njustifying reasons must, in some sense, adhere to an agent\u2019s\nbeliefs and values. Public justification theorists need not adopt\nGaus\u2019s epistemology of justificatory reasons, but the correct\naccount cannot be too far off.\n\nPublic justification theorists thus acknowledge that citizens can\nrationally affirm reasons that others reject. And so, different\nindividuals may have epistemic justification to endorse quite\ndifferent reasons. While members of the public themselves need not\nrecognize these (admittedly) abstruse principles, theorists\nmust accept that two individuals can have reasonable grounds for\naffirming diverse and incompatible reasons.\n\nPublic justification theory rejects actual endorsement standards,\nopting for idealization (as we will see in 2.4). Today theorists\neither appeal to counterfactual endorsement or rationally required\nendorsement. In the former case, an agent would accept the law through\na deliberate act of will. In the latter case, an agent endorses a law\nwhen rationally committed to affirming it; that is, rationality\nrequires that she approve it through a deliberate act of will.\n",
