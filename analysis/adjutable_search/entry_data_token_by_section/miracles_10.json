There is not yet anything approaching a comprehensive\nsurvey of these responses. For limited but still useful historical\ndiscussions of Hume and his influence, see Leland (1755: 47\u2013135),\nLechler (1841: 425 ff), Farrar (1862: 148 ff), Stephen (1876: 309 ff),\nBurns (1981: 131 ff), Craig (1985), Houston (1994: 49\u201382), Tweyman\n(1996), Earman (2000), and Beauchamp\u2019s introduction to the\ncritical edition of Hume\u2019s Enquiry (Hume 1748/2000).\n\n\nAs Charles Sanders Peirce notes (Peirce 1958: 293), the Humean\nin-principle argument has left an indelible impression on modern\nbiblical scholarship. Humean considerations are expressly invoked in\nthe work of the great German critic David Friedrich Strauss (1879:\n199\u2013200), transformed into one of the \u201cpresuppositions of\ncritical history\u201d in the work of the philosopher F. H. Bradley\n(1874/1935), rechristened as the \u201cprinciple of analogy\u201d in\nthe writings of the theologian Ernst Troeltsch (1913), and endorsed,\nexplicitly or implicitly, in many contemporary studies of the\nhistorical Jesus (Dawes 2001: 97\u2013106) and the New Testament (Ehrman\n2003: 228\u201330). Commitment to something like Hume\u2019s position lies\non one side of a deep conceptual fault line that runs through the\ndiscipline of biblical studies.\n\n\nThe Humean objection has also been vigorously contested as destructive\nnot only of miracle stories but of common sense as well. The 19th\ncentury saw a proliferation of satires in which Humean scruples about\naccepting testimony for extraordinary tales were applied to the events\nof secular history, with consequences that are equally disastrous and\nhumorous (Whately 1819/1874, Hudson 1857, Buel 1894). Whately\u2019s\nsatire, which is the most famous, \u201cestablishes\u201d on the\nbasis of many historical improbabilities that Napoleon never existed\nbut was a mythic figure invented by the British government to enhance\nnational unity. Each of these satires makes the same point. One may\nlegitimately require more evidence for a miracle story than for a\nmundane story (Sherlock 1729/1843: 55); but in exaggerating this\nsensible requirement into an insuperable epistemic barrier, Hume and\nhis followers are applying a standard that cannot be applied without\nabsurdity in any other field of historical investigation.\n\n\nA curious feature of recent discussions is that Hume\u2019s\ncritique of reported miracles has itself come under heavy fire and is now viewed in some\nquarters as requiring defense. For a range of views on the matter, see\nLevine (1989: 152 ff), who maintains that Part 1 contains an argument\nbut that the argument is a failure, Johnson (1999), who argues that\nPart 1 is confused and unclear and that various attempts to clarify it\nhave failed to elicit a compelling line of argument, Earman (2000), who\nargues that Part 1 is an \u201cabject failure,\u201d Fogelin\n(2003), who aims to rehabilitate Hume against the critiques of Johnson\nand Earman in particular, and Millican (2013), who argues vigorously that the interpretation of Hume\u2019s argument offered in Earman (2000) is flawed in multiple ways. Millican (2011) offers a sympathetic reconstruction of Hume\u2019s critique in the wider context of Hume\u2019s other metaphysical and epistemological work.\n\n",
