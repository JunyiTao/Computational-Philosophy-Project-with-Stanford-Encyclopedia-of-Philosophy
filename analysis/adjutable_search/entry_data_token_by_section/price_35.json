    "main_text": "Belief || Applications of the Dispositional Model\n6.5 Applications of the Dispositional Model\n\nPrice applies his dispositional model to various issues related to\nbelief, such as the phenomenon of half-belief (1964b: 152ff; 1969:\n305ff), Newman\u2019s (1870) distinction between notional and real\nassent (1969: 315\u2013348), and the puzzle of self-verifying beliefs\n(1969: 349\u2013375), presented as a puzzle for the objectivity of\ntruth.\n\nPrice accounts for half-beliefs with his dispositional model as cases\nwhere there are some elements in the normal, complex\ndisposition which constitutes belief but others are absent.\nFor example, maybe the tendency of the disposition to remain is weaker\nthan it characteristically is, or the disposition to emotion might be\nprompted by certain sensory inputs, as in aesthetic contexts when\nwatching a film or reading a book (1969: 307\u2013308), without\ndispositions to act in certain ways.\n\nThe problem of self-verifying beliefs is that they seem to undermine\nthe conviction that our beliefs are made true by states-of-affairs\nindependent of our beliefs. Consider a competition in which one\nteam\u2019s members are convinced that they can win and this belief\nmotivates them to persevere through difficulties and win. Their belief\nthat they can win is made true by this very belief. Price\u2019s\nsolution is to claim that the belief\u2019s role is to be part of a\ncausal condition which produces the outcome; the truth of the belief\nis in this way an objective matter.\n",
