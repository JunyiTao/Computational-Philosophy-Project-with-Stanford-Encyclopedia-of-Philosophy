    "main_text": "The Regress Problem\n2. The Regress Problem\n\nOn the traditional justified true belief account of knowledge, a\nperson cannot be said to know that a proposition \\(p\\) is true\nwithout having good reasons for believing that \\(p\\) is true. If\nLucy knows that she will pass tomorrow\u2019s exam, she must have good\nreasons for thinking that this is so. Consider now Lucy\u2019s reasons.\nThey will presumably consist of other beliefs she has, e.g., beliefs\nabout how well she did earlier, about how well she has prepared, and\nso on. For Lucy to know that she will pass the exam, these other\nbeliefs, upon which the first belief rests, must also be things that\nLucy knows. Knowledge, after all, cannot be based on something less\nthan knowledge, i.e., on ignorance (cf. Rescher 1979, 76). Since the\nreasons are themselves things that Lucy knows, those reasons must in\nturn be based on reasons, and so on. Thus, any knowledge claim\nrequires a never-ending chain, or \u201cregress\u201d, of reasons\nfor reasons. This seems strange, or even impossible, because it\ninvolves reference to an infinite number of beliefs. But most of us\nthink that knowledge is possible.\n\nWhat is the coherentist\u2019s response to the regress? The coherentist can\nbe understood as proposing that nothing prevents the regress from\nproceeding in a circle. Thus, \\(A\\) can be a reason for \\(B\\)\nwhich is a reason for \\(C\\) which is a reason for \\(A\\). If this\nis acceptable, then what we have is a chain of reasons that is\nnever-ending but which does not involve an infinite number of beliefs.\nIt is never-ending in the sense that for each belief in the chain\nthere is a reason for that belief also in the chain. Yet there is an\nimmediate problem with this response due to the fact that\njustificatory circles are usually thought to be vicious ones. If\nsomeone claims \\(C\\) and is asked why she believes it, she may\nreply that her reason is \\(B\\). If asked why she believes \\(B\\),\nshe may assert \\(A\\). But if prompted to justify her belief in\n\\(A\\), she is not allowed to refer back to \\(C\\) which in the\npresent justificatory context is still in doubt. If she did justify\n\\(A\\) in terms of \\(C\\) nonetheless, her move would lack any\njustificatory force whatsoever.\n\nThe coherentist may respond by denying that she ever intended to\nsuggest that circular reasoning is a legitimate dialectical strategy.\nWhat she objects to is rather the assumption that justification should\nat all proceed in a linear fashion whereby reasons are given for\nreasons, and so on. This assumption of linearity presupposes that what\nis, in a primary sense, justified are individual beliefs. This, says\nthe coherentist, is simply wrong: it is not individual beliefs that\nare primarily justified, but entire belief systems. Particular beliefs\ncan also be justified but only in a secondary or derived sense, if\nthey form part of a justified belief system. This is a coherence\napproach because what makes a belief system justified, on this view,\nis precisely its coherence. A belief system is justified if it is\ncoherent to a sufficiently high degree. This, in essence, is Laurence\nBonJour\u2019s 1985 solution to the regress problem.\n\nThis looks much more promising than the circularity theory. If\nepistemic justification is holistic in this sense, then a central\nassumption behind the regress is indeed false, and so the regress\nnever gets started. Even so, this holistic approach raises many new\nquestions to which the coherentist will need to respond. First of all,\nwe need to get clearer on what the concept of coherence involves as\nthat concept is applied to a belief system. This is the topic of the\nnext section. Second, the proposal that a singular belief is justified\nmerely in virtue of being a member of a justified totality can be\nquestioned because, plausibly, a belief can be a member of a\nsufficiently coherent system without in any way adding to the\ncoherence of that system, e.g., if the belief is the only member which\ndoes not quite fit in an otherwise strikingly coherent system. Surely,\na belief will have to contribute to the coherence of the\nsystem in order to become justified by that system. A particular\nbelief needs, in other words, to cohere with the system of\nwhich it is a member if that belief is to be considered justified. We\nwill turn to this issue in section 4, in connection with Keith\nLehrer\u2019s epistemological work. Finally, we have seen that most\ncoherence theories assign a special role to some beliefs that are\nclose to experience in order to avoid the isolation and alternative\nsystems objections. This fact raises the question of what status those\nspecial beliefs have. Do they have to have some credibility in\nthemselves or can they be totally lacking therein? A particularly\nclear debate on this topic is the Lewis-BonJour controversy over the\npossibility of justification by coherence from scratch, which we will\nexamine more closely in section 5.\n",
