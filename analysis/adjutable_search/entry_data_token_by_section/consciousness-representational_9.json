    "main_text": "Arguments in Favor of the Representational Theory of Sensory Qualities || The Argument from Seeming\n3.4 The Argument from Seeming\n\nByrne (2001) and Thau (2002) appeal to the notion of the way the world\nseems to a subject. Very briefly, as Byrne puts it: \u201cif the way\nthe world seems to him hasn\u2019t changed, then it can\u2019t be\nthat the phenomenal character of his experience has\nchanged\u201d (p. 207), where by \u201cphenomenal character\u201d\nin the context Byrne means sensory qualities. Suppose a subject has\ntwo consecutive experiences that differ in qualitative character. If\nshe is \u201ccompetent\u201d in the sense of having no cognitive\nshortcomings (in particular, her memory is in good working order) and\nis slightly idealized in one or two other ways, she will notice the\nchange in qualitative character. If so, Byrne argues, the way things\nseems to her when she has the second experience must differ from the\nway they seemed to her while she was having the first. For suppose\nthat consecutive experiences are the same in content. Then the world\nseems exactly the same to the subject during both. She \u201chas no\nbasis for\u201d noticing a change in qualitative character either,\nand by the previous premise it follows that there was no change in\nqualitative character (p. 211). The argument generalizes in each of\nseveral natural ways, and Byrne concludes that experiences cannot\ndiffer in qualitative character without differing in representational\ncontent.\n\nIf this sounds too close to being another simple appeal to\ntransparency\u2014and/or to beg the question against mental\npaint\u2014Byrne hastens to add that his argument does not require\ntransparency and is compatible with the existence of mental paint (pp.\n212\u201313). So far as a subject is aware of mental paint, her\nexperience is \u201cpartly reflexive\u201d and represents its own\npaint. Therefore, a difference in paint would be another difference in\nrepresentatum, not a qualitative difference unaccompanied by a content\ndifference.\n\nFrom the orthodox representationalist point of view, that may seem a\ndangerous concession. Byrne does hew to the\nrepresentationalist\u2019s line of supervenience (no qualitative\ndifference without an intentional difference), but if his argument\ndoes not rule out mental paint, an anti-representationalist may\nconstruct inversion cases such as that of Block\u2019s (1990)\n\u201cInverted Earth\u201d (see Section 4.4 below), and argue that\nthe paint is a nonfunctional intrinsic mental feature of the\nexperience given in introspection, which is close enough to a\n\u201cquale\u201d in Block\u2019s special sense, even if the\nfeature does happen to be reflexively represented by the experience\nitself.\n\nAn anti-representationalist might also complain that Byrne has\nequivocated on \u201cseems.\u201d Block (1996) argued that\n\u201clooks\u201d (as in \u201cThat thing looks red to me\u201d)\nis ambiguous, as between an intentional or representational sense and\na separable phenomenal sense, and he believes inversion cases show\nthat the two sorts of looking can come apart. No doubt he would hold\nthe same of \u201cseems.\u201d Whether or not one is persuaded of\nthat claim, Byrne\u2019s argument presupposes that it is false. While\ndoing that does not strictly beg the question, the argument does help\nitself to an assumption that is unlikely to be granted by the\nanti-representationalist.\n",
