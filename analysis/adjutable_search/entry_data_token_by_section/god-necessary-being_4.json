    "main_text": "God\u2019s Grounding Abstract Objects I: Views on Which Necessarily Existing Abstracta Are All Grounded in God || Theistic Emanationism\n3.2 Theistic Emanationism\n\nAccording to the theistic emanationist, necessarily existing abstract\nobjects are caused to exist by some non-contingent feature of divine\nactivity. The standard feature the emanationist appeals to is divine\ncognitive activity of some sort. So, the theistic emanationist will\nsay something like that the number 2 exists because of God\u2019s\ncognitive activity. She will go on to say (and this is how the view is\ndistinct from a theistic voluntarist view) it is not possible\n(it\u2019s true in no possible world, full stop) for God\u2019s\ncognitive activity in this respect to be other than it is. Thus, the\ntheistic emanationist can hold that abstracta really exist in every\npossible world, full stop (allowing that God does, too). \n\nOne example of a theistic emanationist is Leibniz. In his\nMonadology he says:\n\n\n43. It is also true that God is not only the source of existences but\nalso that of essences insofar as they are real, that is, the source of\nthat which is real in possibility. This is because God\u2019s\nunderstanding is the realm of eternal truths, or that of the ideas on\nwhich they depend; without him there would be nothing real in\npossibles, and not only would nothing exist, but also nothing would be\npossible.\n\n44. For if there is a reality in essences or possibilities, or indeed\nin eternal truths, this reality must be grounded in something existent\nand actual, and consequently, it must be grounded in the existence of\nthe necessary being, in whom essence involves existence, that is, in\nwhom possible being is sufficient for actual being. (Leibniz 1714\n[1989: 218])\n\n\nHere Leibniz seems to suggest that necessarily existing abstracta are\ngrounded in divine cognitive activity. It\u2019s not clear exactly\nhow to characterize the relation between the cognitive activity and\nthe existence of the abstract objects, but saying that the former\ncauses the latter to exist seems appropriate given his language. \n\nThomas Morris and Christopher Menzel (1986) also are theistic\nemanationists. They invoke explicitly causal language in setting out\ntheir view, which they call \u201ctheistic activism\u201d.\n\n\nSo our suggestion is that the platonistic framework of reality arises\nout of a creatively efficacious intellective activity of God. It is in\nthis sense that God is the creator of the framework. It depends on\nhim. (1986: 356)\n\n\nThey continue later:\n\n\nLet us refer to this view, the view that a divine intellectual\nactivity is responsible for the framework of reality, as\n\u201ctheistic activism\u201d. A theistic activist will hold God\ncreatively responsible for the entire modal economy, for what is\npossible as well as what is necessary and what is impossible. The\nwhole Platonic realm is thus seen as deriving from God. (1986:\n356)\n\n\nAnd on the next page:\n\n\nGod\u2019s creation of the framework of reality\u2026is an activity\nwhich is conscious, intentional, and neither constrained nor compelled\nby anything independent of God and his causally efficacious power.\n(1986: 357)\n\n\nTheistic emanationism allows the theist to take seriously the claims\nof religious documents that God creates everything (indeed, the name\nof Morris/Menzel\u2019s paper is \u201cAbsolute Creation\u201d),\nand it avoids the problems that beset theistic voluntarism. It has\nvirtues. But it has problems of its own. First, some philosophers\nclaim that God already has to have critical properties in\norder to be able to cause abstracta to exist. The theistic\nemanationist claims that God causes properties such as being\nomniscient, being omnipotent, existing\nnecessarily, being able to cause abstracta to exist, and\nhaving cognitive activity to exist. She also claims that God\ncauses his own haecceity, being God, to exist. However, to\nclaim this is to get the dependence relationship backwards, one might\ncharge. Surely, God\u2019s being able to cause abstract objects to\nexist must be posterior to his having properties like the ones\nmentioned above. And if God has these properties, they must exist.\nBut, the proponent of this theory is committed to the existence of\nproperties being posterior to God\u2019s causing them to exist. Thus,\nthe objection concludes, theistic emanationism is false (see Leftow\n1990, Davison 1991, Davidson 1999, Bergmann and Brower 2006 for\ndiscussion of this sort of objection).\n\nThis sort of argument has seemed to many to be decisive. However,\nthere is a response that the theistic emanationist can give at this\npoint. It might be claimed that although God\u2019s ability to cause\nabstracta to exist is logically dependent on his having certain\nproperties, it is not causally dependent. The account would be\nproblematically circular only if God\u2019s ability to cause\nabstracta to exist were causally dependent on his having certain\nproperties, and his having these properties were in turn causally\ndependent on his having caused these properties to exist. There is a\ncircle of logical dependence here (as there is between any two\nnecessary truths), but there is no circle of causal dependence (see\nMorris and Menzel for this sort of reply).\n\nThe opponent of theistic emanationism might make the following retort.\nCertainly, the above response is right in that if there is a problem\nof circularity, it is one of causal circularity. Earlier, we saw that\nthere for the theistic emanationist is a one-way causal relationship\nbetween God\u2019s cognitive activity and the existence of abstracta\nsuch as being the number two. We can say that the necessary\nexistence of being the number two (or any abstract object)\ncausally depends on God\u2019s having the cognitive activity that he\ndoes. Or, perhaps we might say that the necessary existence of\nbeing the number two causally depends on God\u2019s being\nomniscient, omnipotent and existing necessarily. However, the entities\non which being the number two causally depends are themselves\nproperties. On what do they causally depend? It seems that on the\nemanationist account they wind up causally depending on themselves.\nBut this is incoherent, one might charge.\n\nEven if the emanationist successfully replies to this first problem\nfor the view, there is a second, and perhaps more serious objection to\nthe view. We will call this objection \u201cthe bootstrapping\nobjection\u201d (see Leftow 1990, Davidson 1999, Bergmann and Brower\n2006, and Gould 2014b for discussion of this sort of objection). We\ncan put the concern this way (following Davidson 1999). To cause\nsomething to exist is to cause its essence (or, in the terminology of\nPlantinga 1980, its nature) to be exemplified. Suppose God\ncreates a certain table which has as a part of its essence being\nred. Then God causes the property being red to be\nexemplified by the table when he creates it. Consider the property\nbeing omnipotent. The property being exemplified by\nGod is contained in its essence. So, God causes the property\nbeing exemplified by God to be exemplified by being\nomnipotent in causing being omnipotent to exist. Similar\nto the manner with which God causes being red to be\nexemplified by the table in exemplifying the table\u2019s essence,\nGod causes being omnipotent to be exemplified by himself.\nBut, surely God can\u2019t cause the property being\nomnipotent to be exemplified by himself: How can God make himself\nomnipotent? Furthermore, one might think that God\u2019s omnipotence\nshould be causally prior to his causing properties to exist. However,\non this occasion it is not. Then, if one does think that God\u2019s\nomnipotence should be causally prior to his causing properties to\nexist, this would be an instance of causal circularity. This sort of\nargument will work for other properties like being omniscient\nor having divine cognitive activity (although the causal\ncircle may be more difficult to establish with the former, and the\nimplausibility of self-exemplification may be more difficult to\nestablish with the latter).\n\nFurthermore, consider God\u2019s haecceity, the property being\nGod. The property being necessarily exemplified is\ncontained in the essence of this property. So, when God causes his\nhaecceity to exist, he causes the property being necessarily\nexemplified to be exemplified by his haecceity. Just as God\ncauses being red to be exemplified by the table when he\ncauses it to exist, God causes being God to be exemplified\nnecessarily. However, one might well think this incoherent. Indeed, it\nseems this is the divine causing his own existence: God is pulling\nhimself up by his own bootstraps.\n\nThe theistic emanationist needs to address these sorts of concerns\nabout bootstrapping, and it is not clear how that could be done.\n",
