Speaker-Meaning and Force\n\n\nAs we have seen, that A is an important component of\ncommunication, and that A underdetermines B, do not\njustify the conclusion that B is an important component of\ncommunication. One reason for an asymmetry in our treatment of force\nand decibel level is that the former, but not the latter, seems\ncrucial to how I mean what I say. I intend to speak at a certain\nvolume, and sometimes succeed, but in most cases it is no part of how\nI mean what I say that I happen to be speaking at that volume. On the\nother hand, the force of my utterance is an aspect of what I mean. It\nis not, as we have seen, any aspect of what I say\u2014that notion\nbeing closely associated with content. However, whether I mean what I\nsay as an assertion, a conjecture, a promise or something else will be\ncrucial to how I mean what I do.\n",
