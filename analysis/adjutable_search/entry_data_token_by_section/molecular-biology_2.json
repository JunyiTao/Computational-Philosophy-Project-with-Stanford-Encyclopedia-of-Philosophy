    "main_text": "History of Molecular Biology || Classical Period\n1.2 Classical Period\n\nMolecular biology\u2019s classical period began in 1953, with James\nWatson and Francis Crick\u2019s discovery of the double helical\nstructure of DNA (Watson and Crick 1953a,b). Watson and Crick\u2019s\nscientific relationship unified the various disciplinary approaches\ndiscussed above: Watson, a student of Luria and the phage group,\nrecognized the need to utilize crystallography to elucidate the\nstructure of DNA; Crick, a physicist enticed by Schroedinger\u2019s\nWhat is Life? to turn to biology, became trained in, and\ncontributed to the theory of, x-ray crystallography. At Cambridge\nUniversity, Watson and Crick found that they shared an interest in\ngenes and the structure of DNA (see the entry on\n scientific revolutions).\n\nWatson and Crick collaborated to build a model of the double helical\nstructure of DNA, with its two helical strands held together by\nhydrogen-bonded base pairs (Olby 1994). They made extensive use of\ndata from x-ray crystallography work on DNA by Maurice Wilkins and\nRosalind Franklin at King\u2019s College, London, appallingly without\nFranklin\u2019s permission or even knowledge (Maddox 2002),\nCrick\u2019s theoretical work on crystallography (Crick 1988), and\nthe model building techniques pioneered by Pauling (de Chadarevian\n2002; Judson 1996; Olby 1970, 1994, 2009).\n\nWith the structure of DNA in hand, molecular biology shifted its focus\nto how the double helical structure aided elucidation of the\nmechanisms of genetic replication and function, the keys to\nunderstanding the role of genes in heredity (see the entries on\n replication and reproduction\n and\n inheritance systems).\n This subsequent research was guided by the notion that the gene was\nan informational molecule. According to Lily Kay,\n\n\nUp until around 1950 molecular biologists\u2026described genetic\nmechanisms without ever using the term information. (Kay\n2000: 328)\n\n\n\u201cInformation\u201d replaced earlier talk of biological\n\u201cspecificity\u201d. Watson and Crick\u2019s second paper of\n1953, which discussed the genetical implications of their recently\ndiscovered (Watson and Crick 1953a) double-helical structure of DNA,\nused both \u201ccode\u201d and \u201cinformation\u201d:\n\n\n\u2026it therefore seems likely that the precise sequence of the\nbases is the code which carries the genetical\ninformation\u2026. (Watson and Crick 1953b: 244, emphasis\nadded)\n\n\nIn 1958, Francis Crick used and characterized the concept of\ninformation in the context of stating the \u201ccentral\ndogma\u201d of molecular biology. Crick characterized the central\ndogma as follows:\n\n\nThis states that once \u201cinformation\u201d has passed into\nprotein it cannot get out again. In more detail, the transfer\nof information from nucleic acid to nucleic acid, or from nucleic acid\nto protein may be possible, but transfer from protein to protein, or\nfrom protein to nucleic acid is impossible. Information means here the\nprecise determination of sequence, either of bases in the nucleic acid\nor of amino acid residues in the protein. (Crick 1958: 152\u2013153,\nemphasis in original)\n\n\nIt is important not to confuse the genetic code and genetic\ninformation. The genetic code refers to the relation between three\nbases of DNA, called a \u201ccodon\u201d, and one amino acid. Tables\navailable in molecular biology textbooks (e.g., Watson et al. 1988:\nfrontispiece) show the relation between 64 codons and 20 amino acids.\nFor example, CAC codes for histidine. Only a few exceptions for these\ncoding relations have been found, in a few anomalous cases (see the\nlist in a small table in Alberts et al. 2002: 814). In contrast,\ngenetic information refers to the linear sequence of codons along the\nDNA, which (in the simplest case) are transcribed to messenger RNA,\nwhich are translated to linearly order the amino acids in a\nprotein.\n\nWith the genetic code elucidated and the relationship between genes\nand their molecular products traced, it seemed in the late 1960s that\nthe concept of the gene was secure in its connection between gene\nstructure and gene function. The machinery of protein synthesis\ntranslated the coded information in the linear order of nucleic acid\nbases into the linear order of amino acids in a protein. However, such\n\u201ccolinear\u201d simplicity did not persist. In the late 1970s,\na series of discoveries by molecular biologists complicated the\nstraightforward relationship between a single, continuous DNA sequence\nand its protein product. Overlapping genes were discovered (Barrell et\nal. 1976); such genes were considered \u201coverlapping\u201d\nbecause two different amino acid chains might be read from the same\nstretch of nucleic acids by starting from different points on the DNA\nsequence. And split genes were found (Berget et al. 1977; Chow et al.\n1977). In contrast to the colinearity hypothesis that a continuous\nnucleic acid sequence generated an amino acid chain, it became\napparent that stretches of DNA were often split between coding regions\n(exons) and non-coding regions (introns). Moreover, the exons might be\nseparated by vast portions of this non-coding, supposedly \u201cjunk\nDNA\u201d. The distinction between exons and introns became even more\ncomplicated when\n alternative splicing\n was discovered the following year (Berk and Sharp 1978). A series of\nexons could be spliced together in a variety of ways, thus generating\na variety of molecular products. Discoveries such as overlapping\ngenes, split genes, and alternative splicing forced molecular\nbiologists to rethink their understanding of what actually made a\ngene\u2026a gene (Portin 1993; for a survey of such complications\nsee Gerstein et al. 2007: Table 1).\n\nThese developments in molecular biology have received philosophical\nscrutiny. Molecular biologists sought to discover mechanisms\n(see\n Section 2.1),\n drawing the attention of philosophers to this concept. Also,\nconceptualizing DNA as an informational molecule (see\n Section 2.2)\n was a move that philosophers have subjected to critical scrutiny.\nFinally, the concept of the gene (see\n Section 2.3)\n itself has intrigued philosophers. Complex molecular mechanisms, such\nas alternative splicing, have obligated philosophers to consider to\nwhat the term \u201cgene\u201d actually refers. Experimentation also\nfigured prominently in the classical period (see\n Section 3.4);\n Matthew Meselson and Frank Stahl utilized bacteria grown with\ndifferent weights combined with centrifugation to determine how DNA,\nas modeled by Watson and Crick, was replicated (Meselson and Stahl\n1958; see also The Semi-Conservative Replication of DNA in\n Other Internet Resources).\n \n",
