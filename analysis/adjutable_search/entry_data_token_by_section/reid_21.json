    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy || Moral First Principles\n6.2 Moral First Principles\n\n\nReid uses a method in his development of a deontic normative ethics\nsimilar to the method he uses in his development of an epistemology\nand metaphysics. Reid states first principles that serve as\nfoundational commitments. His ethics contain several types of first\nprinciples, and the principles do not take any single form. Amongst\nthem are factual claims about moral reality, moral judgments about\naction types, claims about obligations, etc. Reid says that there are\nthree types of moral principles, but the distinction between these\ntypes is not always clear.\n\nThe first type is about \u201cvirtue in general.\u201d This set\nincludes statements such as:\n\n\n\n1.\nThere are some things in human conduct that merit approbation and\npraise, others that merit blame and punishment; and different degrees\neither of approbation or of blame, are due to different actions.\n\n\n2.\nWhat is in no degree voluntary, can neither deserve moral\napprobation nor blame.\n\n\n4.\nMen may be highly culpable in omitting what they ought to have\ndone, as well as in doing what they ought not.\n\n\n6.\nIt ought to be our most serious concern to do our duty as far as\nwe know it, and to fortify our minds against every temptation to\ndeviate from it. (EAP 5.1, 271)\n\n\n\n\n\nReid says that these and the other principles \u201cmust appear\nself-evident to every man who hath a conscience.\u201d\n\nThe next set of Reid's moral first principles is about \u201cmore\nparticular\u201d aspects of virtue:\n\n\n\n1.\nWe ought to prefer a greater good, though more distant, to a\nless; and a less evil to a greater.\n\n\n2.\nAs far as the intention of nature appears in the constitution of\nman, we ought to comply with that intention, and to act agreeably to\nit.\n\n\n3.\nNo man is born for himself only.\n\n\n5.\nTo every man who believes the existence, the perfections, and the\nprovidence of God, the veneration and submission we owe to him is\nself-evident. (EAP 5.1, 272, 273, 274, 276)\n\n\n\n\n\nCritics have found many of these principles questionable and their\nstatus as self-evident more questionable. Some critics have argued\nthat they are poorly articulated since Reid does not state definitions\nof key terms like \u201cintention of nature.\u201d Others argue that\nthey depend upon the truth of Christianity. For example, Reid's\ndefense of his second Principle 2 includes discussion of the way in\nwhich God has \u201cexcellently fitted\u201d our conscience, reason,\nnatural instincts and bodily appetites to the benefit of the\nspecies.\n\n\nMoral first principles, like other first principles God has placed in\nour natures, require experience in order to appreciate. In this very\nnarrow way Reid compares moral first principles to mathematical axioms\nsince those axioms are \u201cnot discerned till men come to a certain\ndegree of maturity of understanding. ... In like manner, our Moral\nJudgment or Conscience, grows to maturity from an imperceptible seed,\nplanted by our Creator\u201d (EAP 5.1, 276\u20137). So, though moral\nprinciples are self-evident, they are only known to be true by those\nwho have reached an age of maturity. This resonates with the lessons\nReid derives from the requirements upon witnesses and judges in Scots\nlaw.\n\n\nDespite the fact that he offers a rich set of moral first principles,\nas a moral sense theorist Reid does not intend to systematize a\nnetwork of moral obligations through his first principles. He writes,\n\u201cA system of morals is not like a system of geometry, where the\nsubsequent parts derive their evidence from the preceding, and one\nchain of reasoning is carried on from the beginning;... [instead it]\nresembles more a system of botany, or mineralogy, where the subsequent\nparts depend not for their evidence upon the preceding, and the\narrangement is made to facilitate apprehension and memory, and not\ngive evidence\u201d (EAP 5.2, 281). First principles are given\nin an attempt to classify and systematize our obligations, and are not\ngiven in an attempt to justify and defend them. The actions we are\nobligated to perform are, according to Reid, obvious and, perhaps,\nself-evident.\n",
