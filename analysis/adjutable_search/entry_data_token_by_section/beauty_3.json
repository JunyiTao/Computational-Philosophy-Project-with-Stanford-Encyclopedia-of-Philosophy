    "main_text": "Philosophical Conceptions of Beauty || The Idealist Conception\n2.2 The Idealist Conception\n\nThere are many ways to interpret Plato\u2019s relation to classical\naesthetics. The political system sketched in the Republic\ncharacterizes justice in terms of the relation of part and whole. But\nPlato was also no doubt a dissident in classical culture, and the\naccount of beauty that is expressed specifically in\nthe Symposium\u2014perhaps the key Socratic text for\nneo-Platonism and for the idealist conception of\nbeauty\u2014expresses an aspiration toward beauty as perfect\nunity.\n\nIn the midst of a drinking party, Socrates recounts the teachings of\nhis instructress, one Diotima, on matters of love. She connects the\nexperience of beauty to the erotic or the desire to reproduce (Plato,\n558\u201359 [Symposium 206c\u2013207e]). But the desire to\nreproduce is associated in turn with a desire for the immortal or\neternal: \u201cAnd why all this longing for propagation? Because this\nis the one deathless and eternal element in our mortality. And since\nwe have agreed that the lover longs for the good to be his own\nforever, it follows that we are bound to long for immortality as well\nas for the good\u2014which is to say that Love is a longing for\nimmortality\u201d (Plato, 559, [Symposium\n206e\u2013207a]). What follows is, if not classical, at any rate\nclassic:\n\n\nThe candidate for this initiation cannot, if his efforts are to be\nrewarded, begin too early to devote himself to the beauties of the\nbody. First of all, if his preceptor instructs him as he should, he\nwill fall in love with the beauty of one individual body, so that his\npassion may give life to noble discourse. Next he must consider how\nnearly related the beauty of any one body is to the beauty of any\nother, and he will see that if he is to devote himself to loveliness\nof form it will be absurd to deny that the beauty of each and every\nbody is the same. Having reached this point, he must set himself to be\nthe lover of every lovely body, and bring his passion for the one into\ndue proportion by deeming it of little or no importance.\n\nNext he must grasp that the beauties of the body are as nothing to the\nbeauties of the soul, so that wherever he meets with spiritual\nloveliness, even in the husk of an unlovely body, he will find it\nbeautiful enough to fall in love with and cherish\u2014and beautiful\nenough to quicken in his heart a longing for such discourse as tends\ntoward the building of a noble nature. And from this he will be led to\ncontemplate the beauty of laws and institutions. And when he discovers\nhow every kind of beauty is akin to every other he will conclude that\nthe beauty of the body is not, after all, of so great moment.\n\u2026\n\nAnd so, when his prescribed devotion to boyish beauties has carried\nour candidate so far that the universal beauty dawns upon his inward\nsight, he is almost within reach of the final revelation. \u2026\nStarting from individual beauties, the quest for universal beauty must\nfind him mounting the heavenly ladder, stepping from rung to\nrung\u2014that is, from one to two, and from two to every\nlovely body, and from bodily beauty to the beauty of institutions,\nfrom institutions to learning, and from learning in general to the\nspecial lore that pertains to nothing but the beautiful\nitself\u2014until at last he comes to know what beauty is.\n\nAnd if, my dear Socrates, Diotima went on, man\u2019s life is ever\nworth living, it is when he has attained this vision of the very soul\nof beauty. (Plato, 561\u201363 [Symposium\n210a\u2013211d])\n\n\nBeauty here is conceived\u2014perhaps explicitly in contrast to the\nclassical aesthetics of integral parts and coherent whole\u2014as\nperfect unity, or indeed as the principle of unity itself.\n\nPlotinus, as we have already seen, comes close to equating beauty with\nformedness per se: it is the source of unity among disparate things,\nand it is itself perfect unity. Plotinus specifically attacks what we\nhave called the classical conception of beauty:\n\n\nAlmost everyone declares that the symmetry of parts towards each other\nand towards a whole, with, besides, a certain charm of colour,\nconstitutes the beauty recognized by the eye, that in visible things,\nas indeed in all else, universally, the beautiful thing is essentially\nsymmetrical, patterned.\n\nBut think what this means.\n\nOnly a compound can be beautiful, never anything devoid of parts; and\nonly a whole; the several parts will have beauty, not in themselves,\nbut only as working together to give a comely total. Yet beauty in an\naggregate demands beauty in details; it cannot be constructed out of\nugliness; its law must run throughout.\n\nAll the loveliness of colour and even the light of the sun, being\ndevoid of parts and so not beautiful by symmetry, must be ruled out of\nthe realm of beauty. And how comes gold to be a beautiful thing? And\nlightning by night, and the stars, why are these so fair?\n\nIn sounds also the simple must be proscribed, though often in a whole\nnoble composition each several tone is delicious in itself. (Plotinus,\n21 [Ennead I,6])\n\n\nPlotinus declares that fire is the most beautiful physical thing,\n\u201cmaking ever upwards, the subtlest and sprightliest of all\nbodies, as very near to the unembodied. \u2026 Hence the splendour\nof its light, the splendour that belongs to the Idea\u201d (Plotinus,\n22 [Ennead I,3]). For Plotinus as for Plato, all multiplicity must be\nimmolated finally into unity, and all roads of inquiry and experience\nlead toward the Good/Beautiful/True/Divine.\n\nThis gave rise to a basically mystical vision of the beauty of God\nthat, as Umberto Eco has argued, persisted alongside an anti-aesthetic\nasceticism throughout the Middle Ages: a delight in profusion that\nfinally merges into a single spiritual unity. In the sixth century,\nPseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite characterized the whole of creation as\nyearning toward God; the universe is called into being by love of God\nas beauty (Pseudo-Dionysius, 4.7; see Kirwan 1999, 29).\nSensual/aesthetic pleasures could be considered the expressions of the\nimmense, beautiful profusion of God and our ravishment thereby. Eco\nquotes Suger, Abbot of St Denis in the twelfth century, describing a\nrichly-appointed church:\n\n\nThus, when\u2014out of my delight in the beauty of the house of\nGod\u2014the loveliness of the many-colored gems has called me away\nfrom external cares, and worthy meditation has induced me to reflect,\ntransferring that which is material to that which is immaterial, on\nthe diversity of the sacred virtues: then it seems to me that I see\nmyself dwelling, as it were, in some strange region of the universe\nwhich neither exists entirely in the slime of the earth nor entirely\nin the purity of Heaven; and that, by the grace of God, I can be\ntransported from this inferior to that higher world in an anagogical\nmanner. (Eco 1959, 14)\n\n\nThis conception has had many expressions in the modern era, including\nin such figures as Shaftesbury, Schiller, and Hegel, according to whom\nthe aesthetic or the experience of art and beauty is a primary bridge\n(or to use the Platonic image, stairway or ladder) between the\nmaterial and the spiritual. For Shaftesbury, there are three levels of\nbeauty: what God makes (nature); what human beings make from nature or\nwhat is transformed by human intelligence (art, for example); and\nfinally, the intelligence that makes even these artists (that is,\nGod). Shaftesbury\u2019s character Theocles describes \u201cthe\nthird order of beauty,\u201d\n\n\nwhich forms not only such as we call mere forms but even the forms\nwhich form. For we ourselves are notable architects in matter, and can\nshow lifeless bodies brought into form, and fashioned by our own\nhands, but that which fashions even minds themselves, contains in\nitself all the beauties fashioned by those minds, and is consequently\nthe principle, source, and fountain of all beauty. \u2026 Whatever\nappears in our second order of forms, or whatever is derived or\nproduced from thence, all this is eminently, principally, and\noriginally in this last order of supreme and sovereign beauty.\n\u2026 Thus architecture, music, and all which is of human\ninvention, resolves itself into this last order. (Shaftesbury 1738,\n228\u201329)\n\n\nSchiller\u2019s expression of a similar series of thoughts was\nfundamentally influential on the conceptions of beauty developed\nwithin German Idealism:\n\n\nThe pre-rational concept of Beauty, if such a thing be adduced, can be\ndrawn from no actual case\u2014rather does itself correct and guide\nour judgement concerning every actual case; it must therefore be\nsought along the path of abstraction, and it can be inferred simply\nfrom the possibility of a nature that is both sensuous and rational;\nin a word, Beauty must be exhibited as a necessary condition of\nhumanity. Beauty \u2026 makes of man a whole, complete in himself.\n(1795, 59\u201360, 86)\n\n\nFor Schiller, beauty or play or art (he uses the words, rather\ncavalierly, almost interchangeably) performs the process of\nintegrating or rendering compatible the natural and the spiritual, or\nthe sensuous and the rational: only in such a state of integration are\nwe\u2014who exist simultaneously on both these levels\u2014free.\nThis is quite similar to Plato\u2019s \u2018ladder\u2019: beauty as\na way to ascend to the abstract or spiritual. But\nSchiller\u2014though this is at times unclear\u2014is more concerned\nwith integrating the realms of nature and spirit than with\ntranscending the level of physical reality entirely, a la Plato. It is\nbeauty and art that performs this integration.\n\nIn this and in other ways\u2014including in the tripartite\ndialectical structure of his account\u2014Schiller strikingly\nanticipates Hegel, who writes as follows.\n\n\nThe philosophical Concept of the beautiful, to indicate its true\nnature at least in a preliminary way, must contain, reconciled within\nitself, both the extremes which have been mentioned [the ideal and the\nempirical] because it unites metaphysical universality with real\nparticularity. (Hegel 1835, 22)\n\n\nBeauty, we might say, or artistic beauty at any rate, is a route from\nthe sensuous and particular to the Absolute and to freedom, from\nfinitude to the infinite, formulations that\u2014while they are\ninfluenced by Schiller\u2014strikingly recall Shaftesbury, Plotinus,\nand Plato.\n\nHegel, who associates beauty and art with mind and spirit, holds with\nShaftesbury that the beauty of art is higher than the beauty of\nnature, on the grounds that, as Hegel puts it, \u201cthe beauty of\nart is born of the spirit and born again\u201d (Hegel 1835,\n2). That is, the natural world is born of God, but the beauty of art\ntransforms that material again by the spirit of the artist. This idea\nreaches is apogee in Benedetto Croce, who very nearly denies that\nnature can ever be beautiful, or at any rate asserts that the beauty\nof nature is a reflection of the beauty of art. \u201cThe real\nmeaning of \u2018natural beauty\u2019 is that certain persons,\nthings, places are, by the effect which they exert upon one,\ncomparable with poetry, painting, sculpture, and the other arts\u201d\n(Croce 1928, 230).\n",
