    "main_text": "Arguments for Divine Timelessness || Arguments from Divine Foreknowledge\n6.2 Arguments from Divine Foreknowledge\n\nOne line of thought is that complete knowledge of future contingent\nevents is impossible for beings in time. Since God is omniscient, and\ntherefore knows all that will happen, God is timeless.\n\nAnother line of thought is that while God is omniscient, and therefore\nknows all that will happen, some of our actions are genuinely free.\nBut these two facts are in tension with one another, and the tension\ncan be resolved by thinking of God as timeless.\n\nHere is this line of thought in more detail. First consider an\nargument for theological fatalism, the view that divine foreknowledge\nand freedom are incompatible (Pike 1965; Murray & Rea 2008: Ch.\n2). God is omniscient. So God knows all that is true and believes\nnothing false. Now consider the proposition p that you will\nread this section 1,000 years hence. Suppose p was true 1,000\nyears ago. Then God believed p then. And you never had a choice\nabout whether God believed p 1,000 years ago. Nor have you ever\nhad a choice about anything that follows from God\u2019s believing\np 1,000 years ago, including that you read this section today.\nSo you never had a choice about whether you read this section today,\nwhich means you\u2019re not doing it freely.\n\nOne proposed solution is to deny that p was true 1,000 years\nago. (Aristotle responds in this way to a similar, non-theological\nargument for logical fatalism.) For more on this solution, see the SEP\nentries on\n foreknowledge and free will\n and\n fatalism.\n\nA defender of divine timelessness may attempt another solution\n(inspired by Boethius). God is not located in time, so God does not\nknow or believe things at times. So it is not the case that God\nbelieved p 1,000 years ago. Rather, all temporal events are\nbefore God\u2019s mind \u201cat once\u201d, or in an atemporal\npresent. However, some argue that a similar problem still arises\n(Zagzebski 1991: Ch. 2).\n",
