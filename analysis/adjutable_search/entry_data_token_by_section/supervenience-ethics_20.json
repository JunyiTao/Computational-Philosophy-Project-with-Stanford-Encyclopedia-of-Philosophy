However, it might instead be a sign that supervenience\nis a dogma, accepted without adequate critical examination. This\nsection briefly explains two challenges to the epistemic credentials\nof ethical supervenience.\n\nJoseph Raz briefly suggests that the supervenience of the ethical does\nnot purport to explain much. And he suggests that this explanatory\npoverty gives us reason to doubt whether the ethical supervenes.\nAccording to Raz, ethical supervenience neither provides more specific\ntheses that allow us to concretely explain the ethical features of\nreality, nor guarantees that we can find such explanatory theses\n(2000, 54\u20135). If we assume that we should accept only those\ntheoretical claims that do substantial explanatory work, then this\ncasts doubt on ethical supervenience as a theoretical claim.\n\nSection 2\n suggested a different explanatory case for supervenience than the one\nRaz considers: general ethical supervenience theses serve to explain\nthe host of specific ethical supervenience facts that we notice. These\nfacts are perhaps not themselves explanatory. But they may seem\ndifficult to intelligibly deny, at least pending a developed moral\nepistemology that might adjudicate their epistemic credentials.\n\nAlison Hills (2009) argues that we can undermine the case for ethical\nsupervenience by granting that in many cases ethical difference\nwithout naturalistic difference seems inconceivable, and\narguing that we should not take inconceivability here to be a good\nguide to impossibility. She suggests that the appearance of\ninconceivability may be grounded in our unwillingness to engage in\ncertain distasteful imaginative exercises.\n\nHills bolsters this case by arguing that if we consider a\ncontroversial and low-stakes case\u2014say, whether a certain lie\nmade with benevolent motives is permissible\u2014we are able to\nconceive of such a lie being either permissible or impermissible. But,\nshe suggests, if we can conceive of it as being permissible, and as\nbeing impermissible, we have shown that we are able to conceive of two\nethically inconsistent possible worlds. Further, this low-stakes case\nis easier to conceive of than the possibility of Hitler being a moral\nparagon, and Hills suggests that this supports the idea that\nconceivability is grounded in our willingness to imagine certain\npossibilities, for we presumably have a stronger desire to avoid\nimagining Hitler as a moral paragon than we do to avoid imagining the\nlower-stakes case.\n",
