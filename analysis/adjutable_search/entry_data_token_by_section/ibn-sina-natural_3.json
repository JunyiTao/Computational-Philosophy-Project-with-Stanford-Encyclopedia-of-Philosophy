    "main_text": "Bodies and Magnitudes || General Background\n2.1 General Background\n\nWith the distinction between nature as active and nature as passive in\nplace, it becomes clear why Avicenna identifies the proper subject\nmatter of natural philosophy with body insofar as it is subject to\nmotion, for the science of physics studies nature in both of its\nactive and passive senses. Nature as passive refers to that which is\nsubject to motion, namely, bodies, while nature as active refers to\nthe causes and conditions of the motions and actions that bodies\nnaturally undergo. In this section, I begin with Avicenna\u2019s\ngeneral introduction to bodies. I then take up his critique of\natomism, specifically as that theory was developed within Kal\u0101m.\nThereafter, I turn to Avicenna\u2019s theory of the continuity of\nmagnitudes and his conception of infinity, concluding with a brief\nsurvey of his theory of the elements.\n\nSensible body (jism or occasionally jirm), one can\nassume, is an aggregation of parts. Starting from this assumption,\nAvicenna next says of the body that it either (1) has actual\nparts or (2) has no actual parts. Avicenna effectively\ndivides the logical space for a discussion of the aggregation of body\ninto two categorical propositions: either \u201cSome parts in a body\nare actual\u201d or \u201cNo parts in a body are actual.\u201d\nThese are logically contradictory propositions, and so along one\ndimension they exhaust all logically possible options. In the case of\n\u201csome parts,\u201d the obvious question is, \u201cHow\nmany?\u201d where \u201cfinite\u201d and \u201cinfinite\u201d\nexhaust the possible options. Of course, the question, \u201cHow\nmany?\u201d is irrelevant when applied to no or 0 parts. Thus, there\nare three possible positions: body is an aggregate of (1) a finite\nnumber of actual parts, a position identified with that of the\natomists; (2) an infinite number of actual parts, a position\nidentified with that of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm al-Na\u1e93\u1e93\u0101m\n(c. 775\u2013c. 845); (3) no actual parts, a position associated with\nthe Aristotelian tradition and the contention that bodies are\ncontinuous and so not an aggregate of actual parts, even if\npotentially divisible ad inifinitum.\n\nAvicenna makes short work of (2), al-Na\u1e93\u1e93\u0101m\u2019s\nposition (Avicenna, [PR], nama\u1e6d 1, ch. 2; and [Ph], 3.4\n[1]). The parts are units of the whole, which must have either no\nmagnitude or some magnitude. If the units have no magnitude, then\nwhile multiplying them may increase the number of units present in a\nbody, it will not increase the size of the body. Consequently, bodies\nwould not have any magnitude, an obviously false conclusion. If the\nunits have some magnitude, be it ever so small, and the body is\ncomposed of an actual infinity of these units, then complains\nAvicenna, \u201cthe relation of the finite units to the infinite\nunits would be the relation of a finite to a finite, which is an\nabsurd contradiction\u201d (Avicenna, [PR], nama\u1e6d 1,\nch. 2, p. 162). For instance, assume that\nal-Na\u1e93\u1e93\u0101m\u2019s unit measures some extremely small\nyet positive amount of distance, for example, 1.5 x 10-35\nof a meter, then:\n\n\u221e al-Na\u1e93\u1e93\u0101m\u2019s-units : 1 m :: 1.5 x\n10-35 al-Na\u1e93\u1e93\u0101m\u2019s-units : 1 m.\n\n\nThus \u221e : 1.5 x 10-35, that is, an infinite is\nproportional to a finite, which, as Avicenna notes, is absurd.\n\nAvicenna\u2019s more important target was Kal\u0101m atomism, which\nis significantly different from the Democritean atomism, which\nAristotle had criticized. Thus, let us consider it quickly before\nturning to Avicenna\u2019s critique of atomism.\n",
