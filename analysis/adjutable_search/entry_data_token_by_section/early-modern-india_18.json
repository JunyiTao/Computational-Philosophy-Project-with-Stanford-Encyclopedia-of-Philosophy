    "main_text": "Causation and the Causal Theory of Knowledge || What is a Cause?\n6.3 What is a Cause?\n\nThe Naiy\u0101yikas build up in this way a model of causation, in\nwhich different causal factors have different types of causal role.\nThe model reflects (or is reflected in) the Indian grammatical\nanalysis of causal statements, such as \u201cThe potter throws a pot\nwith her stick\u201d, \u201cThe lumberjack fells a tree with her\naxe\u201d, in which one distinguishes, apart from the verb\ndesignating the event, an agent (kart\u1e5b), object\n(karman), instrument (kara\u1e47a), and so on. We\ndo not yet know, however, how to distinguish between causes and\nnon-causes. The Manual of Reason (TS 41) provides the\nNavya-Ny\u0101ya answer. Given two entities, c and\ne,\n\nc is a causal factor for e iff\n\nc exists before e,\nc exists \u2018regularly\u2019\n(niyata) with e, and\nc is \u2018relevant\u2019\n(ananyath\u0101siddha) to e.\n\n\n\nThe first clause is to prevent self-causation. The import of the\nsecond condition is that entities similar to c must always\nexist with entities similar to e. There must be an invariable\nor constant conjunction between c-type entities and\ne-type entities. This rules out objects which just happen to\nbe there, such as, to give the Naiy\u0101yikas\u2019 example, a\ndonkey happening to wander past the pottery just as the potter goes to\nwork. This feature of the account, the insistence that a causal\nrelation instantiates a regularity, resembles a Humean account of\ncausation. The Naiy\u0101yika, however, recognised the possibility of\n\u2018accidental\u2019, non-causal regularities, such as day always\npreceding night, or (the example given by The Manual of\nReason), the colour of the thread always preceding the cloth.\nAlthough the occurrence of a cloth is invariably preceded, not just by\nthreads, but by the presence of thread-colour as well, we would not\nwant to say that thread-colour is a cause of cloth. The third clause\nis their attempt to eliminate such accidental regularities. The same\nclause is supposed to stop the cause of a cause (e.g. the\npotter\u2019s parents) from being a cause. Its meaning, however, is\nnot quite clear. Literally, it states that a cause must be \u2018not\nestablished otherwise\u2019. Kalidas Bhattacharya says that \u201can\ninvariable antecedent is irrelevant if knowledge of it is not required\nfor any anticipative knowledge of the origination of the effect\u201d\n(see Potter 1977: 67). Matilal says that an antecedent is irrelevant\nif \u201cit is possible to find a reasonable explanation of its\nappearance\u201d (1985: 290). The Manual of Reason states\nthat an antecedent is irrelevant if its antecedence is only\nestablished along with some other entity. We know that thread-colour\nprecedes cloth only because we know that it occurs with the thread\n(which we know to precede cloth); hence the thread-colour is\nirrelevant in this sense. This highlights an asymmetry between the two\nregularities, the threadcolour-cloth regularity and the thread-cloth\nregularity. For while we can establish the latter directly by\nobserving correlations between thread and cloth, we establish the\nformer by observing the correlation between threadcolour and thread.\nThus the former supposedly depends on the latter but not vice versa.\nIt is not clear, however, that the dependence does not run the other\nway too. In any case, in using this criterion to block transitivity,\nthe Naiy\u0101yikas seem to seeking a definition not of causality per\nse (which most regard as a transitive relation), but rather an\nepistemic notion of \u2018causal explanation\u2019 or \u2018causal\nsalience\u2019.\n",
