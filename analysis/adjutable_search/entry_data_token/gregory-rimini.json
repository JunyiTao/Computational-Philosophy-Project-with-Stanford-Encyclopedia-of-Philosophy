Life and Work\n\nBiographical information for much of the life of Gregory of Rimini\n(a.k.a. de Arimino, Ariminensis, the \u201cTorturer of\nInfants,\u201d the Lucerna splendens, and the\nDoctor acutus or authenticus) derives from\na letter of Pope Clement VI, dated 12 January 1345, requesting\nGregory\u2019s promotion to Master of Theology at the University of\nParis:\n\nGregory of Rimini, of the Order of the Friars Hermits of Saint\nAugustine, Parisian bachelor of theology, has now studied for\ntwenty-two years, namely six straight years at Paris, and afterwards,\nreturning to his native soil, he held the main chair at Bologna,\nPadua, and Perugia, and it has now been four years since he returned\nto Paris to lecture on the Sentences, lectures he has\ncompleted there commendably (Delucca 2003, 50).\n\n\nAccording to the letter, then, Gregory first studied theology at Paris\nfrom 1322 or 1323 until 1328 or 1329. Working backwards, we can\nestimate that Gregory was born in Rimini around 1300, joined the\nmendicant order of the Hermits of Saint Augustine (OESA), and received\nhis basic education before going to Paris. There he was exposed to the\nlatest developments in philosophical theology, especially the ideas of\nthe Franciscan Peter Auriol, who had died in early 1322. Assuming that\nthe sequence in the papal letter is strictly chronological, Gregory\nthen taught theology at various Augustinian studia in Italy,\nfirst at Bologna, where he is attested as lector in documents\nof late 1332, 1333, and early 1337. Perhaps he was transferred to\nPadua at the Augustinians\u2019 General Chapter meeting in Siena in\n1338, and then he was shifted to Perugia. Almost certainly while he\nwas in Italy, Gregory came into contact with the works of Oxford\nscholars from the 1320s and 1330s, most notably William of Ockham,\nAdam Wodeham, Richard Fitzralph, and Walter Chatton. Pope\nClement\u2019s letter suggests that Gregory returned to Paris in late\n1340 or in 1341 in order to lecture on the Sentences, but\nperhaps the \u201cfour years\u201d refers to the date of his\norder\u2019s General Chapter of Montpellier, 1341, which may have\nbeen the occasion when Gregory was assigned to return to Paris. The\nprevailing view is that Gregory went to Paris in 1342 for a year of\npreparation for his lectures on the Sentences, which were\ngiven in 1343\u201344, but given that our records of these lectures\nwere subject to revision, there is a degree of uncertainty. With help\nfrom the pope\u2019s letter, Gregory probably became Master of\nTheology in 1345, holding at least one quodlibetal disputation at\nParis, but he continued to revise his written Sentences\ncommentary until 1346, removing certain passages that were formerly\nconsidered later additiones. In late 1346 Master Gregory was\nin Rimini and the following year we find him teaching again in Padua,\nwhere he stayed until 1351 when the General Chapter at Basel sent him\nto teach at the recently established studium in Rimini. He\nremained there at least until late 1356, but on 20 May 1357, at the\nGeneral Chapter in Montpellier, he was elected the Augustinians\u2019\nprior general, succeeding the late Thomas of Strasbourg. Gregory died\nin Vienna toward the end of 1358 (see V. Marcolino\u2019s chapter in\nOberman 1981, 127\u201394; Lambertini et al. 2002; Delucca 2003).\n\nGregory\u2019s most important writing by far is his commentary on the\nfirst two books of the Sentences. Book I survives in some\ntwenty complete manuscripts, while there are about a dozen for book\nII. The work was printed several times from 1482 to 1532, reprinted in\n1955, and finally received a modern critical edition in six volumes in\n1979\u201384 (Rimini 1979\u201384; Bermon 2002). Parts have been or\nare being translated into French, German, and English. The status of\nBooks III and IV is unclear. It has been argued that they never\nexisted and that Gregory chose not to comment on them (Bermon 2002,\n274; Mandarella 2016, 198). However, Gregory explicitly says that he\nwill defer the treatment of certain questions to Book III (Girard\n2017, 241). In addition to scriptural commentaries, smaller writings\nhave been ascribed to Gregory, including a work usually known as\nDe usura, printed in 1508 and again in 1622 (see below,\nsection 6), and some tabulae of Augustine\u2019s works (see\nBermon 2007, 24\u201325 and Bermon forthcoming). His tract on the intension\nand remission of forms, De intensione et remissione formarum\ncorporalium, carries the incipit \u201cCirca secundum partem\nhuius distinctionis\u201d and is, therefore, just an excerpt of the\nSentences commentary, book I, distinction 17, part 2 (see\nLoewe 2014, 274). Finally, from his brief term as his order\u2019s\nprior general we have his correspondence, which has been published\n(Rimini 1976).\n2. Position in the History of Philosophy\n\nAlthough Gregory of Rimini has received considerable attention from\nhistorians of medieval thought, understanding his position in the\nhistory of philosophy has been made difficult by several problems that\nhave plagued the historiography of fourteenth-century scholasticism.\nHe flourished at a time that has been judged by historians as on the\nwhole decadent, fideistic, and radically skeptical, in contrast to the\nperiod in which, for example, Thomas Aquinas worked (d. 1274); this\nhistorical viewpoint already made difficult an objective evaluation of\nRimini. Historians also labeled Gregory a \u201cnominalist,\u201d a\nterm so broad and vague when applied to fourteenth-century thinkers\nthat, when it was used without qualification, it tended to mislead and\nto obscure the differences among them, as for example between Ockham\nand Gregory. Finally, unlike Aquinas, Henry of Ghent, and John Duns\nScotus, Gregory was active in a relatively understudied period, so\nthat placing Gregory in his context is difficult and statements about\nGregory\u2019s originality are precarious. The history of\nGregory\u2019s own University of Paris in the quarter century before\nhis Sentences lectures, in contrast to that of Oxford in the\nsame years, is particularly unclear. Few scholars realize, moreover,\nthat from the 1330s until the onset of the Great Schism in 1378,\ndecades when the traditional leaders of European thought, the\nFranciscans and Dominicans, were in decline, Gregory was the leading\nlight in an era in which his own Augustinian Order dominated, with\nsuch towering figures as Thomas of Strasbourg, Alphonsus Vargas of\nToledo, and Hugolino of Orvieto, and a number of other important\nauthors. Only careful diachronic studies of specific philosophical\nproblems can provide a precise picture of Gregory\u2019s role in the\nhistory of philosophy, and few such studies have been accomplished\nthus far. There are some, however, and natural philosophy,\nepistemology, foreknowledge, and predestination are examples of topics\nabout which we know quite a bit (see below).\n\nGenerally, what has been learned so far is that Gregory was really the\nfirst to introduce to the University of Paris the exciting ideas\ndeveloped at English schools between William of Ockham (ca. 1319) and\nThomas Bradwardine (ca. 1344). Beginning with Gregory the names of\nAdam Wodeham, Richard Fitzralph, Walter Chatton, William Heytesbury,\nThomas Buckingham, Richard Kilvington, Robert Halifax and others\nbecame common knowledge among Parisian scholars. Gregory was also\ndeeply influenced by recent thinkers at his own university, both\nnegatively and positively. The impact of Peter Auriol has long been\nrecognized to be great, but recent studies have made clear that other\nfigures, such as Francis of Marchia, Thomas of Strasbourg, Gerard\nOdonis, and Michael of Massa, had an influence on Gregory. The\nquestion of Gregory\u2019s relationship to his Parisian predecessors\nneeds to be investigated more fully.\n\nMore clear is Gregory\u2019s importance in the late Middle Ages and\nReformation, even if much of this period has received relatively\nlittle attention. Gregory\u2019s impact is obvious, because many\nscholastics after 1350 copied large passages from his works, including\nsuch prominent figures as the Cistercian James of Eltville, Pierre\nd\u2019Ailly, and Henry of Langenstein. Other important thinkers,\nsuch as Hugolino of Orvieto OESA, the Cistercian Pierre Ceffons,\nMarsilius of Inghen, and Peter of Candia OFM (Pope Alexander V) knew\nGregory\u2019s ideas well and cited them often. Few if any\nphilosophers in the later fourteenth century can have been unaffected\nby his ideas, and for many he was their main inspiration.\nGregory\u2019s impact both inside and outside the Augustinian Order\ncontinued into the fifteenth century. The common Sentences\ncommentary (the so-called Quaestiones communes) of the\nUniversity of Vienna in the first half of the century was largely\nbased directly or indirectly on Gregory\u2019s thought, often\nduplicating his words (see recently, Schabel 2020). In the celebrated\nquarrel over future contingents at the University of Louvain\n(1465\u20131474), several of the participants cited Gregory\u2019s\nposition or even adopted it without attribution. Of course, the fact\nthat only books I and II of Gregory\u2019s commentary circulated\nmeans that Gregory\u2019s direct impact is to be found in topics\ndiscussed in those books rather than in issues covered in books III\nand IV, such as the Immaculate Conception and the Eucharist, which had\ntheir own philosophical sub-issues.\n\nPerhaps the most central element of Gregory of Rimini\u2019s thought\nand influence is his adherence to Augustine and the nature of that\nadherence. For one thing, Gregory simply read Augustine more carefully\nand extensively than most previous thinkers, and so, for example,\nGregory was able to attack Peter Auriol for his faulty citations and\nquotations of Augustine. Gregory\u2019s interest in the works of\nAugustine has been seen as central to the development of a\n\u201chistorico-critical\u201d method in philosophical theology,\nespecially in the Augustinian Order, partly foreshadowing modern\nscholarly methods. In connection with this historico-critical method,\nGregory was part of a general attempt to establish reliable texts of\nAugustine and to separate authentic works from the pseudo-Augustinian\ncorpus. Quotations from Augustine, moreover, were cited with great\naccuracy and detail in Gregory\u2019s writings, and so his\nSentences commentary, when not plagiarized for his own ideas,\nwas often used as a source for Augustinian quotations (Trapp\n1956).\n\nNot surprisingly, Gregory\u2019s ideas are often Augustinian.\nGregory\u2019s brand of doctrinal Augustinianism, influenced rather\nby the Franciscan and Oxonian tradition than the more Dominican (and\nParisian) variety of Giles of Rome, soon dominated the Augustinian\nHermits\u2019 philosophy and theology. Thus by the early 16th century\nAegidistae and Gregoriistae schools of thought\nexisted, and a recognized via Gregorii was present in many\nuniversities such as Wittenberg, the university of Gregory\u2019s\nfellow Augustinian Hermit Martin Luther (McGrath 1987). The fact that\nGregory\u2019s extreme Augustinian views on predestination became\nvirtually official doctrine at the University of Vienna, and each book\nof his Sentences commentary was printed six times between\n1482 and 1532, further helps explain why some of Gregory\u2019s ideas\noften resemble those of Luther and Jean Calvin. Gregory\u2019s\nthought had a life after the reformation, perhaps influencing\nFrancisco Suarez, but certainly having an impact on\nseventeenth-century debates over such topics as predestination.\n\nA list of Gregory\u2019s philosophical positions would perhaps not be\ndifficult to make, and neither would it be hard to describe his\nrelation to Ockham on various topics (e.g. Smith 1999, Mandrella\n2016). In natural philosophy, for example, in agreement with Ockham,\nGregory was a nominalist and employed \u201cOckham\u2019s\u201d\nrazor in denying that sudden change, motion, and time are independent\nentities (Brown 1998b). Gregory also claims that the world could have\nbeen eternal. But in this case one would like to know better the\nstances of Gregory\u2019s immediate predecessors, especially\nParisians like Francis of Marchia, in order to determine the possible\nsources and degree of originality of Gregory\u2019s ideas. On the\neternity of the world, for example, Gregory\u2019s view was not very\nstrange in his day. Otherwise, a list of Gregory\u2019s ideas is just\nthat, a mere list. Consequently the focus here shall be on a few of\nthe issues on which the theories of Gregory and his predecessors have\nbeen investigated in some depth.\n3. Theology\n\nIn many ways Gregory was a philosopher\u2019s theologian, because he\nbegan with propositions from Scripture as premises for his arguments\nand proceeded deductively (Brown 1998b, 200\u2013201). In his deductive\ntheology, Gregory devoted much time and space to defining his terms\nand exploring exhaustively the implications of possible solutions, a\npractice that makes his Sentences commentary a joy to read\nand a philosophical classic.\n\nGregory\u2019s approach to trinitarian questions has been described\nas one of \u201cradical minimalism\u201d (Friedman 2013, 847). Like\nWalter Chatton, Robert Holkot and William of Rubio before him, Gregory\nadopts Praepositinianism: the divine persons are distinct by\nthemselves, they are not constituted, and there are no properties\ndistinct from the persons. As a result, divine simplicity is\npreserved, at the expense of explanation (Friedman 2013, 853\u2013854). In\nthis context, Gregory \u2019s trinitarian theology is radically\nminimalist because he went further than other defenders of\nPraepositinianism (Friedman 2013, 867) in thoroughly rejecting any\nprinciple of divine operations, therefore clearly dismissing what\nFriedman calls the \u201cpsychological model,\u201d according to\nwhich the intellect and the will, as divine attributes, would play the\npart of such principles.\n\nIn distinctions 38\u201341 of book I, Gregory tackled the general\nproblem of divine foreknowledge and future contingents and the\nspecific dilemma of predestination and free will. Gregory\u2019s\npositions on these questions have already been the subject of study\nfor many decades, and recently historians have attempted to put\nGregory into his immediate Parisian and Oxonian context. Moreover,\nGregory\u2019s nickname, \u201cthe Torturer of Infants,\u201d stems\nin part from his stance on predestination. A discussion of\nGregory\u2019s thought on these issues, therefore, provides a\nconvenient introduction both to his noetic and to his position in\nhistory.\n3.1 Foreknowledge and Contingency\n\nGregory\u2019s treatment of divine foreknowledge and future\ncontingents is aimed primarily at Peter Auriol and secondarily at\nOxford theologians (Vignaux 1934, ch. 4; Hoenen 1993, 196\u2013214;\nSchabel 2000, 264\u2013274; Fiorentino 2004; Ciammetti 2011). In\norder to preserve the contingency of events stemming from human free\nwill, Auriol claimed that propositions about future contingents are\nneither true nor false, but rather neutral, and so God does not know\nthat the Antichrist will exist, since \u201cthe Antichrist will\nexist\u201d is neither true nor false. Although like Ockham and\nRimini later, Auriol maintained that exactly how God knows the future\nis incomprehensible to us, he did give a sophisticated explanation and\ndefense of God\u2019s knowledge of our future. Gregory, however,\nchose to focus on the above-mentioned elements in Auriol\u2019s\nposition. Gregory recognized that Auriol\u2019s theory of\nfuture-contingent propositions relies on Aristotle\u2019s stance in\nchapter 9 of On Interpretation. Interestingly, although\nGregory denied the truth of the position itself, he nevertheless held\nthat it was in fact Aristotle\u2019s. Indeed he rejected any attempt\nto interpret Aristotle differently, in the way that many medieval and\nmodern philosophers have tried to do:\n\n[This] is apparently a friendly excuse, but in truth it is more of an\naccusation, because the fact that absurdities ensue [from this\nposition] does not convince us that [Aristotle] did not think that,\nbut convinces us that he ought not to have thought that... Moreover,\nsome modern theologians [i.e., Auriol], great teachers, said that the\nconclusion [denying determinate truth to future-contingent\npropositions] not only was the Philosopher\u2019s intention, but also\nthat it is very true and even demonstrated... (Rimini 1979, 243).\n\n\nSo for Gregory, Auriol was correct that Aristotle denied the Principle\nof Bivalence when applied to propositions about future\ncontingents.\n\nAuriol set up two basic rules for such propositions: (1) if a\nproposition about the future, say, \u201cSocrates will run,\u201d is\ntrue, it is true immutably and inevitably, since no instant can be\nfound when it would be false. (2) The significate of such a\nproposition will inevitably and necessarily be put into being. The\nfoundation for Auriol\u2019s claim is his modal theory: immutability\nand necessity are the same thing. If something is immutable, it cannot\nbe different from what it is, and so it necessarily is the way it\nis.\n\nGregory answered with a rigorous and lengthy defense of Bivalence and\nan alternative modal theory. His defense of Bivalence includes a\ndetailed set of rules for propositions. It is significant that this\nsection of Gregory\u2019s text, some seven pages, stems from Francis\nof Marchia\u2019s refutation of Auriol\u2019s position, a refutation\nadopted and extended by Gregory\u2019s own Augustinian predecessor at\nParis, Michael of Massa. In short, Gregory argued that the Principle\nof Bivalence applies universally, and Aristotle was wrong to make an\nexception in the case of future-contingent propositions. Although this\nwas his basic disagreement with Auriol, Gregory was so careful a\nphilosopher that before he refuted Auriol on this point he corrected\nhis Franciscan predecessor on details and in so doing made\nAuriol\u2019s own theory more precise.\n\nAuriol placed greater emphasis on divine simplicity and necessity than\non divine freedom and contingency when he was wrestling with one of\nthe fundamental problems of Christian philosophical theology: given an\nabsolutely simple and necessary God, what is the source of\ncontingency? Auriol\u2019s own explanation lies in God\u2019s\nrelationship with events in time, but this explanation was not of\ninterest to Rimini, who was convinced by Scriptural prophecy that God\ndoes in fact know the future, and convinced by logic that the\nPrinciple of Bivalence holds universally. So the problem becomes, if\nGod knows that Socrates will run, and the proposition \u201cSocrates\nwill run\u201d is true, will not Socrates run necessarily?\n\nRimini\u2019s answer is a version of the opinio communis, a\nposition with roots in Scotus and the Parisian tradition but which\nOckham and later Oxford scholars refined with their focus on\npropositions. (It is possible that Ockham was influenced by Auriol in\nhis concentration on future-contingent propositions, as some have\nheld, but there is nothing specific to indicate that Ockham knew\nAuriol\u2019s treatment, and after Scotus it was natural for\ntheologians to focus their attention on the truth of future-contingent\npropositions anyway.) The opinio communis relies on\nGod\u2019s freedom to save contingency in the world: everything other\nthan God is ultimately contingent, because God wills and acts freely\nand contingently in creating, and so it is logically possible for the\nthings in the world not to have been or to have been otherwise. At the\nsame time, the common position affirms God\u2019s immutability and\ndeterminate knowledge of such things. The upshot is that true\npropositions about future contingents have always been true and are\nimmutably true, even determinately true, but that they are only\ncontingently true and not necessarily so. So Gregory denies\nAuriol\u2019s equation of necessity and immutability.\n\nGregory\u2019s position relies on interesting uses of common logical\ndevices and distinctions developed at Paris and Oxford over the\npreceding century, such as the distinction between the composite and\ndivided senses of propositions, and that between conditional and\nabsolute necessity. The purpose of these distinctions was to offer a\nway of explaining the contingency of events, but in doing so they\nassumed the ultimate contingency of everything except God. However,\nfar from being an affirmation of the \u201cradical contingency\u201d\nof the world, as some historians have claimed, it was in fact the only\nway for most theologians to save at least some contingency from the\nthreat of absolute logical and divine determinism. In fact, Gregory\nand others admitted that, assuming God\u2019s knowledge of the\nfuture, the future was necessary ex suppositione, although\nnot absolutely, because it is logically possible for immutable God to\nknow otherwise. Peter Auriol, and later Peter de Rivo, Pietro\nPomponazzi, and Martin Luther, would consider these efforts feeble and\ndeluded. The three Peters resorted to alternative theories that others\nconsidered equally feeble and deluded, whereas Luther simply accepted\nthe conclusion that all attempts to save meaningful contingency\ngoverned by human free will were doomed to failure.\n\nWhat is interesting about Gregory\u2019s treatment, again, is not his\noriginality, but the clarity and precision with which he presented the\ncommon position. He even pointed out problems in the discussions of\nthose with whom he broadly agreed, such as Ockham. True, almost all of\nwhat Rimini said could be found in Marchia, Massa, Ockham, Landulph\nCaracciolo, Adam Wodeham, and others, but not in such an organized\nfashion.\n\nOne final element of Gregory\u2019s stance on modal matters that\ndeserves our attention is the contingency or necessity of the past.\nThe opinio communis maintained that the past is somehow\nnecessary in a strong sense, even though it is not absolutely\nnecessary. It seems that Gregory did not go so far as to say that the\npast is necessary (beyond the normal necessity ex\nsuppositione), but he does make some sort of modal distinction\nbetween the past and the future. Thus we can say that Gregory did not\nthink God can change the past, although there has been some\ndisagreement on this issue (Courtenay 1972\u201373; Schabel 2000,\n271\u20132). Suffice it to say that the time has come for a long and\ncareful treatment of the modal status of the past in medieval thought,\nto determine whether any thinker ever really thought the past could be\nchanged. The probable answer is negative.\n3.2 Predestination\n\nPredestination was the traditional subject of distinctions 40\u201341\nof commentaries on book I of the Sentences. This was a more\npurely \u201ctheological\u201d subset of the more\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d topic of foreknowledge and future\ncontingents treated in distinctions 38\u201339. As in the case of\nforeknowledge, Gregory proceeded slowly and carefully, defining his\nterms and outlining the possible positions. Gregory\u2019s\nAugustinian bent shows through more clearly in predestination than in\nforeknowledge. Gregory quoted Augustine\u2019s words no less than 43\ntimes in this context, and cited him still more often. Frequent\nscriptural quotations, carefully chosen, provide the ultimate basis\nfor his theory. From Romans 9.13, where Paul comments on Malachi 1.2,\n\u201cJacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated,\u201d Gregory took\nhis position that from eternity, God actively elects to damn some and\nto save others, a theory called Double Predestination or Double\nParticular Election (Vignaux 1934, ch. 4; Sch\u00fcler 1934; Halverson\n1998, 143\u2013157; Schabel 2002).\n\nThe main issue is what the causal connection is between humans\u2019\nwilling and acting and their salvation or damnation, and\npredestination or reprobation: do humans participate in or contribute\nto their own salvation and damnation, or is God\u2019s will the sole\ncause? Traditionally the answer had been that humans are the cause of\ntheir deserved damnation, but that salvation depended solely on\nGod\u2019s will. Although there were various interpretations of this\ntraditional stance, Peter Auriol seems to have been the first\nimportant university scholar to provide a real alternative. Auriol had\nalready sought to distance God from the everyday details of the\nworld\u2019s existence, in order to preserve divine necessity and the\ncontingency of things. Auriol now applied his general theory to the\nspecific issue of soteriology and claimed that God sets up general\nrules by which certain sets of people will be damned and other sets\nsaved, without actively choosing to save or damn specific individuals.\nThis maintained divine immutability but had the added bonus of\nproviding symmetry for reprobation and predestination: the determining\nfactor is the presence or absence of an obstacle to grace (obex\ngratiae). For Auriol, while someone\u2019s obstacle to grace is\nindeed a positive cause of reprobation, the absence of such an\nobstacle, however, is merely a negative or privative cause of\npredestination. Thus Auriol thought he could avoid charges of\nPelagianism by simply denying a positive cause of\npredestination in the elect. Ockham appears to have adopted the main\nelements of Auriol\u2019s stance, while Walter Chatton at Oxford and\nGerard Odonis and Thomas of Strasbourg at Paris went further and\nposited a positive cause of predestination in the elect, which would\nappear to approach the condemned Pelagian doctrine.\n\nGregory reacted by charging that both the theory of the privative\ncause and the notion of the positive cause of predestination in those\nwho are predestined are Pelagian. Instead Gregory returned to the\ntraditional view as it concerned predestination: it stems only from\nGod\u2019s merciful will. However, Auriol\u2019s criticism of the\nasymmetry of the traditional position led Gregory to claim that not\nonly do the predestined play no causal role in their salvation, but\nneither do the reprobate contribute to their damnation. In short,\nthere is no reason either for one person\u2019s salvation or for\nanother person\u2019s damnation except the inscrutable will of God:\nwe do not know why some are saved and others damned. This, after all,\nGregory believed, was the theory of Paul and of Augustine.\n\nOne has to admire Gregory\u2019s consistency here, mirroring that of\nhis opponent, Peter Auriol. In the case of divine foreknowledge,\nAuriol provided an alternative to the traditional position because he\nclaimed that the common defense of contingency failed. Auriol\u2019s\ntheory allowed him to preserve the causal role of humans in\nreprobation, at the expense perhaps of involving humans in\npredestination and therefore coming close to Pelagianism. There were\nproblems with Auriol\u2019s stance, but it was consistent. Gregory,\non the other hand, agreed with the common position on divine\nforeknowledge, but when it really counted, in soteriology, Gregory\ntook this common position to what he (and Auriol) thought was its\nlogical conclusion. Since God\u2019s free creation and action is\nreally the only source of contingency in the world, then God\u2019s\nfree will is the only real cause of salvation and damnation. Salvation\nand damnation are contingent like anything else, but not contingent\nupon human free will, but merely on God\u2019s will. No doubt for\nGregory, everyone else who held the opinio communis should\nalso have held to Double Predestination or Double Particular Election.\nIndeed, at least one of Gregory\u2019s immediate predecessors, the\nCarmelite Guy Terrena, appears to have agreed (Schabel 2015). Luther\nand Calvin agreed with Gregory, but they saw no reason for the logical\ndevices of the opinio communis, which for them as for Auriol\ncould not save the contingency of human willing.\n4. Cognition\n\nEpistemology is another subject in which Gregory\u2019s thought has\nreceived much attention (e.g. Elie 1937; Dal Pra 1956; G\u00e1l\n1977; Eckermann 1978; V. Wendland\u2019s chapter in Oberman 1981,\n242\u2013300; Tachau 1988, 358\u201371; Bermon 2007; Mandrella 2016;\nGirard 2017). Gregory maintains a non-realist position that universals\nare formed by the soul and only after the mind has previous\napprehensions of singular things. Thus sensory experience plays a\nmajor role in intellectual cognition. For simple cognition Gregory\nadopts the common terminology of the dichotomy between intuitive and\nabstractive cognition, although the difference between the two is\nbased on the objects rather than the modes of cognition. For Gregory,\nintuitive cognition terminates immediately at the extramental object,\nbut abstractive terminates at the object\u2019s species in the soul.\nThe fact that Gregory made room for such species in his theory of\ncognition has not gone unnoticed (Corvino 1978; Spruit 2013, 309\u2013313;\nMandrella 2016, 220\u2013223). It has been described as the only difference\nbetween Ockham and Rimini in the epistemology of simple cognition\n(Mandrella 2016, 223). Still, Gregory\u2019s use of species\nconditions his take on universal concepts to such an extent that he\nembraces a view Ockham explicitly rejected as especially irrational,\nnamely the view that universal concepts are qualities really distinct\nfrom mental acts and that remain in the soul independently of whether\na mental act is directed at them or not (Girard 2017, 263).\n\nInspired by some of Ockham\u2019s successors, Gregory argues against\nthe Venerable Inceptor\u2019s claim that via intuitive cognition one\ncould determine whether a thing does exist or not (Tachau 1988, 363).\nIn agreement with Auriol against most contemporaries, however, Gregory\nalso holds that one can have an intuitive cognition of an object that\ndoes not exist, as for example when we see a \u201cbroken\u201d\npencil in a glass of water, when there is only an unbroken pencil in\nreality. But Auriol is wrong in claiming that this is an instance of\nan intuitive cognition of something absent (Tachau 1988, 361), because\nfor Gregory the cognition is really caused by the species of some\npresent object, although perhaps not the object that the mind thinks\nit is. Therefore Gregory does not adopt Auriol\u2019s definition of\nintuitive cognition as the cognition when the soul merely thinks that\nthe object is present. In any case the dichotomy is different for\nGregory because he maintains that abstractive cognition is also\nsomewhat intuitive, since the species of the object is known\nimmediately and therefore intuitively.\n\nWhen it comes to the object of complex cognition, or scientific\nknowledge, Gregory\u2019s inspiration was Adam Wodeham, who built on\nsome of Walter Chatton\u2019s ideas in developing the complexe\nsignificabile. Ockham held that the object of scientific\nknowledge is the conclusion of a syllogism, and Gregory rejects this.\nChatton\u2019s alternative was that scientific knowledge has as its\nobject things outside the mind. Gregory also denies this, because\n\nif this were the case, many sciences would be about contingent things\nthat could be different than they are, whereas for strict science the\nobject must be eternal and necessary. Every being, however, besides\nGod is contingent and not necessary. If things outside the mind were\nthe objects of the sciences, then many sciences, physical and\ngeometrical, and many others, would be about things other than God,\nand therefore about contingent things (Rimini 1979, 6; Brown 1998a,\n171).\n\n\nOne can see here how Gregory\u2019s stress on the overarching\ncontingency of creation connects with his epistemology.\n\nGregory chooses as the object of scientific knowledge the alternative\noffered by Adam Wodeham. Chatton\u2019s notion of \u201cthing\u201d\nin scientific knowledge was the state of affairs signified by both the\nnegative and the affirmative proposition. For example, \u201cSocrates\nis sitting\u201d and \u201cSocrates is not sitting\u201d signify\nfor Chatton the same thing, not Socrates, not sitting, and not the\npropositions, but somehow the whole Socrates\u2019s-being-seated.\nAlthough Chatton had his reasons for his theory, Wodeham modified it\nin a useful way, differentiating between positive and negative states\nof affairs. Thus for Wodeham, each proposition has its own total\nsignificate that is only complexly signifiable (complexe\nsignificabile), so that Socrates\u2019s-being-seated and\nSocrates\u2019s-not-being-seated are two different things, the\nobjects of scientific knowledge.\n\nGregory adopted Wodeham\u2019s theory and tailored it where necessary\nto his own thought. The complexe significabile, once thought\nto be Gregory\u2019s invention, is neither the proposition itself,\nnor individual things in the world, nor the arrangement of things in\nthe world. The exact status of Gregory\u2019s complexe\nsignificabile has been much discussed. In a nutshell, there are\nthree main interpretations. The first one builds on Gregory\u2019s\nclaim that the complexe significabile is nothing\n(nihil), and thus holds that Gregory does not defend logical\nrealism (Biard 1989, 183, Libera 2002, 217; Bermon 2007,\n166\u2013167). The second interpretation builds on Gregory\u2019s\nclaim that there are senses of \u201csomething\u201d\n(aliquid), \u201cthing\u201d (res) and\n\u201cbeing\u201d (ens) that can apply to the complexe\nsignificabile, and insists that the\ncomplexe significabile must be something mind-independent\nbecause of this, although it is not an entity (Elie 1936, 28, 174;\nNuchelmans 1973, 73). The third interpretation concludes from the fact\nthat the complexe significabile is said to be something but\nnot an entity to the fact that the complexe significabile\nmust be mind-dependent or in the mind (Trapp 1977, 58; Mandrella 2016,\n208, as a legitimate hypothesis). Another point of debate concerns how\none should evaluate Gregory\u2019s take on Wodeham\u2019s ideas.\nThat debate opposes those who consider Gregory\u2019s developments as\na clearer elaboration of the concept (Bermon 2007, 169, 173), and\nthose who believe Gregory blurred the clear picture Wodeham had given,\nthus making the doctrine of the complexe significabile an\neasy target (G\u00e0l 1977, 70; Nuchelmans 1980, 185\u2013186; Zupko\n1994\u20131997, 218).\n\nGregory famously listed three ways in which some complexe\nsignificabile could be said to be true: first, because a\nproposition signifying it would be true; second, with reference to the\nuncreated truth; third, because it is the case (i.e. it obtains).\nThese descriptions have sometimes been read as competing ones (Elie\n1936, 175). If there is a general agreement that the first way must be\nleft aside as too weak, since it makes the truth of the complexe\nsignificabilia depend on enunciations, it has been claimed that\nthe second and third ways are compatible with each other (Libera 2002,\n253; Conti 2004, 482\u2013483) and even complementary (Bermon 2007,\n161\u2013162).\n\nIt is also known that Gregory differed from Wodeham in the way he\nthought about \u201cassenting to\u201d and \u201cdissenting\nfrom\u201d such complexe significabilia, an issue which had\noccupied Chatton at length. Wodeham thought of assent pretty much as\nan act of the will (Bermon 2007, 319), that can contingently be added\nover and above a formed proposition. Gregory distinguishes two kinds\nof mental propositions: mental propositions that are not expressed in\na given language, and mental propositions that are expressed in a\ngiven language and that derive from the first kind. For Gregory,\nWodeham\u2019s claim is true only of linguistic mental propositions\n(Bermon 2007, 343\u2013344). For non-linguistic mental propositions,\nit is impossible to dissociate the formation and the acts of assent or\ndissent. Formation and assent are associated in such a way that\nGregory can claim that assent is a mental utterance (Bermon 2007,\n331).\n\nGregory applied the notion to a host of philosophical problems, such\nas future contingents, and through him the complexe\nsignificabile became the common intellectual property of\ncontinental thinkers, and parallel notions are found in many important\nlater intellectuals. More particularly, recent studies have focused on\nthe reception of Gregory\u2019s doctrine in Pierre Ceffons (Nannini\n2015; Corbini 2020).\n\nApart from complexe significabilia, another point of contact\nbetween Wodeham and Gregory in connection with complex cognition is\nthe debate on the capacity that non-human animals have to make a\njudgement (i.e. Reina 1986; Perler 2006, 89\u201394; Oelze 2018,\n123\u2013129).  Gregory claims that we need to ascribe sensory\njudgments to non-human animals in order to account for their\nbehaviour, especially for the different responses a same individual\ncan exhibit to a same stimulus (Oelze 2018, 126\u2013127).\n\nWith regard to the mental proposition, although Gregory defends that\nthe intellect can indeed have simultaneous acts (Friedman 2009, 114;\nDubouclez 2014, 342\u2013347), nevertheless he holds, as Durand of\nSaint-Pour\u00e7ain did, that the mental proposition must consist of\na single act (Friedman 2009, 115).\n5. Natural Philosophy\n\nComing to natural philosophy, Gregory of Rimini\u2019s conception of\nthe continuum has been the object of several studies (i.e., Maier 1949,\n172\u2013173, 176\u2013177; Cross 1998; Sylla 2005,\n260\u2013268). According to Gregory, following Adam Wodeham, the\ncontinuum is not composed of point-like entities, but parts of the\ncontinuum are themselves magnitudes (Cross 1998, 96). Gregory also\nclaims, this time against Wodeham, that the division of the continuum\ncan actually be completed, so that it is composed of an actual\ninfinity of potential extended parts (Cross 1998, 97\u201398). It is\nunderstood that each of these parts itself includes an infinity of\nparts (Cross 1998, 102). That said, a problem is to see how exactly\nthe division of the continuum can be completed if any part of the\ncontinuum must be said to contain an infinity of parts. It has been\nargued that it is in connection with this issue that several scholars\n(following Maier 1949, 172\u2013173) read Gregory as holding that\nthere are infinitesimal parts in the continuum (Cross 1998,\n103\u2013104). Yet, in fact, the process is completed, not because\none reaches something that cannot be divided, but because every part\nhas been actually set apart from the others, including the ones it\ncontains (Cross 1998, 103). It is in connection with its conception of\na continuum composed of an actual infinity of parts, each themselves\ncomposed of an actual infinity of parts, that Gregory explains how an\ninfinite can be greater than another by including it (Cross 1998,\n105\u2013106; Thakkar 2009, 631\u2013632), thus answering\nBradwardine\u2019s objection on infinite parts and wholes (Thakkar\n2009, 628\u2013629).\n\nGregory\u2019s views on minima naturalia also attracted\nattention. Although Gregory acknowledges that there is a minimal\nextensive quantity some subject needs to have in order to receive a\ngiven form (Sylla 2011, 403), he rejects the idea that forms of a\ngiven species would have intensive minima, relying on ideas developed\nby Richard Kilvington (Knuuttila 1971, 313; Loewe 2014, 320\u2013323).\n\nIn general, Gregory\u2019s answer to the problem of the intension and\nremission of forms (i.e. how to account for increases or decreases of\na given quality) had a life of its own, since it circulated as a\nseparate treatise, the Tractatus de intensione et remissione\nformarum corporalium (Loewe 2014, 274). Gregory argued that when\nintension occurs, a form of the same species is added to the subject,\nso that this new form and the preceding form now constitute a total\nform that has per se unity (Loewe 2014, 286, 316).\n6. Economic Thought\n\nAlthough his commentary on books I and II of the Sentences is\nby far Gregory\u2019s largest and most important work, historians of\nmedieval philosophy have recently devoted some attention to his sole\nwriting on economic thought, which was printed in Reggio Emilia in\n1508 as the Tractatus de imprestantiis Venetorum et de usura\nand reprinted in Rimini itself over a century later in 1622 (Rimini\n1508; Lambertini 2003, 2009; Kirshner 2015). The only known manuscript\nwitness is in a codex containing various political and economic\ntracts: Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, Conv. Soppr. J. X.\n51, ff. 201r-212r. The manuscript carries a different redaction of the\ntext, but it can be used to correct the printed editions and should\nform the basis of a future critical edition. The title and explicit in\nthe manuscript further identify the work as a quaestio\ndisputata on the forced loans of the Venetian commune according\nto the determination of Gregory of Rimini, Master of Theology and\nprior general of the Augustinians. Terminology in the text itself\nconfirms that rather than a purely written work, the piece derives\nfrom an oral disputation, although the internal structure and the\nexistence of two redactions indicate that it was much revised\nafterwards. Since we know that theologians\u2019 administrative\nresponsibilities did not preclude their participation in such events\nas quodlibetal disputations, it is possible that the debate took place\nwhile Gregory was his order\u2019s prior general as the incipit says,\ni.e., in the latter half of 1357 or in 1358, which would make it his\nlast word on intellectual matters.\n\nGregory was actually asked two questions, and he combined them in his\ndetermination. The first was whether it was licit for a creditor to\nreceive interest on a forced loan. Various Italian communes resorted\nto forced loans from their citizens to raise money, paying in return\nan annual sum but never the principal. In the case of Venice, the\nforced lender received 5%. The second question asked whether it was\nlicit for someone else to acquire the title to the loan from the\nforced lender, for a sum smaller than the initial loan, and continue\nto receive the annual sum from the commune. For example, the\ngovernment could demand $100 from a citizen, promising to pay $5 each\nyear. Another citizen could then pay $25 to the first citizen and\nacquire the right to receive the annual payment of $5.\n\nThe issue was a concrete one in the fourteenth century, and several\nscholars were asked similar or even identical questions, which allows\nus to place Gregory\u2019s determination in a historical context. One\nwriter gave a liberal response to the first question, that the mere\nfact that the loan was forced made the creditor\u2019s receiving of\n5% interest licit, while the same author considered the second\ntransaction an acceptable contract of sale and not a purchase of a\nloan. A more conservative author, on the other hand, viewed the 5% as\nusury, unless it constituted a spontaneous gift from the commune to\nthe citizen and as long as the citizen did not intend to profit. In\nthis case, the gift could not be purchased licitly by another,\nnaturally, for the unforced buyer would surely be a usurer.\n\nGregory\u2019s treatment has been singled out as historically\nsignificant. Gregory\u2019s procedure reflects his earlier\nSentences commentary in his careful structure. Following\nopening arguments, Gregory divides the determination into four\narticles, first defining his terms, second discussing the sinfulness\nof usury, third answering the questions, and fourth responding to the\nopening arguments. Although Gregory is a Master of Theology, he\nanswers the question as a philosopher, employing rational arguments.\nFor Gregory, usury is wrong pure and simple, since it breaks the rule\nof equality in exchanges. One might view this as a conservative\napproach, but Gregory\u2019s general position may entail a liberal\nimplementation of his theory, since the determining factor lies in\none\u2019s conscience, in one\u2019s intent: \u201cUsury is profit\nintended from a loan.\u201d Gregory\u2019s emphasis on the\nrole of intent and conscience here is unusual. In the case at hand,\nVenice can legitimately pay the 5% only if the commune\u2019s motives\nare honorable, either because it believes it is paying for damages or\nreturning a kindness, although Gregory excludes from the rubric\n\u201cdamages\u201d the opportunity costs from the resulting\nnon-acquisition of possible profits, thus further demonstrating his\nawareness of business and banking practices. Since Venice pays all\nforced creditors such a regular annual fee, however, it does not seem\nto Gregory to be paid for either of those reasons. Still, he leaves it\nup to the conscience.\n\nThis applies to the second question as well. The creditor who has\ngiven the loan in good conscience and without hope of profit has not\ncommitted usury, so he has \u201ca right over the commune\u201d that\nhe can sell licitly. Moreover, the buyer can purchase this licitly, as\nlong as he does not intend to profit thereby. But if this is not the\ncase, if profit is intended, the sin of usury is committed, more\nseriously than in the first case, since no force is involved.\n\nGregory\u2019s determination would allow Venice and its creditors to\nproceed with their practice of forced loans and creditors\u2019\ntransfers of annual payments without outward restrictions from the\nChurch. Perhaps he was being practical given the complexities of the\nsituation. By stressing the role of intent and conscience, he freed\ninvestors to pursue their projects. But without drawing clear lines\nseparating the legitimate from the illegitimate, he burdened them to\nconsider their motives in each and every transaction, warning that\nwhether they are usurers in truth will be determined before God at the\njudgment of souls.\n7. Conclusion\n\nNow that Gregory\u2019s works are available in a reliable modern\nedition, he has begun receiving more direct attention, for example in\nthe collection of papers in Oberman 1981 and in the conference held in\nRimini in 2000 that was devoted to Gregory\u2019s life and thought\n(published as Gregorio da Rimini. Filosofo in Rimini in\n2003). It is to be hoped that further studies of his Parisian and\nOxford predecessors on various single issues will enable us to see his\ninnovations more clearly. Recent studies have shown that he was not\nalways as original as was once thought, but that does not diminish in\nany way his important position in the history of philosophy. Moreover,\nGregory sometimes did come up with new solutions to problems, and even\nwhere he did not, his treatments, because of their clarity and\ncomprehensiveness, often became the primary source for later thinkers\nof the ideas he adopted from his predecessors and developed.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Sources", "Secondary Works"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Sources": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Gregory of Rimini, <em>Tractatus de impresantiis Venetorum et de\nusura</em>, Reggio Emilia: Ludovicus de Mazalis 1508; Rimini\n1622.", "Gregory of Rimini, <em>Gregorii de Arimino OSA Registrum\nGeneralatus 1357\u20131358</em>, A.
