    "main_text": "Enlightenment\n7. Enlightenment\n\nHamann is sometimes portrayed simply as an opponent of \u201cthe\nEnlightenment\u201d. This presupposes of course that \u201cthe\nEnlightenment\u201d constitutes a unified stance on a number of\nphilosophical issues, an assumption which is questionable. The\nmajority of Hamann scholars today see his position in a more complex\nway. Hamann opposed many of the popular convictions of his time.\nHowever, Hamann fought his contemporaries on many fronts; therefore\nthere were often areas of considerable agreement with some of his\nopponents. One example would be the way that he deployed Hume as a\nweapon against Enlightenment rationalism, not least against Kant\n(although Hamann was the one who introduced Kant to Hume\u2019s\nwritings in the first place). Although Hamann, as a Christian, had\nprofound disagreements with Hume\u2019s thought in its atheistic\naspects, nevertheless he used Humean skepticism in his own\ndeconstructive writings. Hume\u2019s doubts about the reliability and\nself-sufficiency of reason were grist to Hamann\u2019s mill.\nHume\u2019s insistence that \u201cbelief\u201d underlies much of\nour thinking and reasoning was adopted and deployed by Hamann, often\nwith a linguistic sleight of hand. By using the word\n\u201cGlaube\u201d (which in German includes both\n\u201cbelief\u201d in an epistemic sense and \u201cfaith\u201d in\na religious sense), Hamann could assert that \u201cfaith\u201d, not\nrational grounds, underlies his contemporaries\u2019 high valuation\nof reason. Thus even the enthusiastic advocates of impartiality and\n\u201creason\u201d, who are also skeptics about \u201cblind\nfaith\u201d, have ultimately only faith as the ground for their\nconvictions.\n\nJudging from letters late in his life, Hamann preferred to be seen as\na \u201cmetacritic\u201d of the Enlightenment. His dissatisfactions\nwith what he viewed as a certain Enlightenment program began early,\nfollowing his conversion to Christianity; and his challenge could be\nseen not as a blunt, unreasoning opposition to rationality, but as a\ndeeper (and more disruptive) challenge to what rationality and\nEnlightenment actually consist in. Often these are seen in his\nresonses to his friend Immanuel Kant. An early challenge came in his\nfirst public essay, \u201cSocratic Memorabilia\u201d (1759), which\nwas dedicated to Kant and their mutual friend Christoph Berens. Kant\nand Berens had sought to cast him as a campaigner on behalf of the\nEnlightenment. In the essay he portrays Socrates, the hero of the\nEnlightenment, as a Christ-figure rather than a champion of secular\nreason. Hamann\u2019s abreaction to what he viewed as a misguided\ndeification and purification of reason reaches a climax in 1784, in\nhis unpublished response to Kant \u2014 \u201cMetacritique of the\nPurism of Reason\u201d (1984) and in an inflamed private letter to\nChristian Jacob Kraus in the same year. This letter takes issue with\nKant\u2019s famous essay \u201cAn Answer to the Question: What is\nEnlightenment?\u201d (1984). Here he argues that what Kant describes\nas the intellectual \u201cself-incurred minority\u201d (minority in\nthe sense of being a minor, immaturity, tutelage) of the general\npublic, an (alleged) need to be told what to think, is not\nself-imposed. Rather, it is imposed, Hamann suggests, on the one hand\nby a politically authoritarian regime hostile to dissent and political\nfree-thinking, while encouraging religious free-thinking; and on the\nother hand by professional experts: the \u201cprattle and reasoning\nof those emancipated immature ones, who set themselves up as\nguardians\u201d. \u201cTrue enlightenment,\u201d Hamann concludes\nsarcastically, \u201cconsists in an emergence of the immature person\nfrom a supremely self-incurred guardianship.\u201d\n",
