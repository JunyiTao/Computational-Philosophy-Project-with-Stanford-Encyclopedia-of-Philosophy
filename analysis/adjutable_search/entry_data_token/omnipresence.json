Some Issues involving Omnipresence and Historical Background\n\nAccording to classical theism, God is omnipresent, that is, present\neverywhere. But classical theism also holds that God is immaterial.\nHow can something that is not, or does not have, a body be located in\nspace? Early discussions of divine presence typically began by\ndistinguishing God\u2019s presence in space from that of material\nbodies.\n Augustine\n (354\u2013430) writes,\n\nAlthough in speaking of him we say that God is everywhere present, we\nmust resist carnal ideas and withdraw our mind from our bodily senses,\nand not imagine that God is distributed through all things by a sort\nof extension of size, as earth or water or air or light are\ndistributed (Letter 187, Ch. 2).\n\n\nElsewhere Augustine continues this theme and introduces a new element,\nnamely, the suggestion that divine presence might be understood by\nanalogy with the presence of the soul:\n\n[Some people] are not able to imagine any substance except what is\ncorporeal, whether those substances be grosser, like water and earth,\nor finer, like air and light, but still corporeal. None of these can\nbe wholly everywhere, since they are necessarily composed of\nnumberless parts, some here and some there; however large or however\nsmall the substance may be, it occupies an amount of space, and it\nfills that space without being entire in any part of it. Consequently,\nit is a characteristic of corporeal substances alone to be condensed\nand rarified, contracted and expanded, divided into small bits and\nenlarged into a great mass. The nature of the soul is very different\nfrom that of the body, and much more different is the nature of God\nwho is the Creator of both body and soul (Letter 137).\n\n\nAugustine adds two further points: First, God \u201cknows how to be\nwholly everywhere without being confined to any place\u201d\n(Letter 137). In contrast to material objects, which, having\nparts in various parts of the space they occupy, are not wholly\npresent at any of those regions, God is wholly present\nwherever he is. Second, God is not contained in or confined\nby any of the places at which he exists. Augustine is thus explicit\nthat God is not present in the way corporeal substances are present,\nbut his positive proposal for divine presence is less well developed.\nHe notes that God\u2019s light, strength, and wisdom reach everywhere\n(Letter 187, Ch. 7), and he holds that \u201cGod so\npermeates all things as to be not a quality of the world, but the very\ncreative substance of the world ruling the world without labor,\nsustaining it without effort.\u201d Rather than going on to explain\nthese ideas, however, this passage simply ends with what became a\nfamiliar formula:\n\nNevertheless, he [God] is not distributed through space by size so\nthat half of him should be in half the world and half in the other\nhalf of it. He is wholly present in all of it in such wise as to be\nwholly in heaven alone and wholly in the earth alone and wholly in\nheaven and earth together; not confined in any place, but wholly in\nhimself everywhere.\n\n\nAnselm\n (1033\u20131109) also distinguishes God\u2019s presence from the\nway in which material objects are contained in space, and he, too,\nappeals to the concept of being wholly present. In his\nMonologion Anselm discusses omnipresence in a series of\nchapters with paradoxical titles. In chapter 20 he states that\n\u201cthe Supreme Being exists in every place and at all\ntimes.\u201d But in the following chapter, he argues that God\n\u201cexists in no place and at no time.\u201d Finally, he attempts\nto reconcile these \u201ctwo conclusions\u2014so contradictory\naccording to their utterance, so necessary according to their\nproof\u201d, by distinguishing two senses of \u201cbeing wholly in a\nplace.\u201d In one sense those things are wholly in a place\n\u201cwhose magnitude place contains by circumscribing it, and\ncircumscribes by containing it.\u201d In this sense, an ordinary\nmaterial object is contained in a place. God, however, is not thus\ncontained in space, for it is \u201ca mark of shameless impudence to\nsay that place circumscribes the magnitude of Supreme Truth.\u201d\nInstead, God is in every place in the sense that he is present at\nevery place. According to Anselm, \u201cthe Supreme Being must be\npresent as a whole in every different place at once.\u201d Like\nAugustine, then, Anselm denies that God is contained in space. Also,\nlike Augustine, he seems to leave unexplained this second relation of\nbeing \u201cpresent as a whole\u201d in every place.\n\nIn his (1988) Edward Wierenga attempts to supply the missing details.\nHe notes that Anselm holds that souls could be wholly present in more\nthan one place, provided that they sensed in more than one place, and\nthat Anselm (in his Proslogion) adds that perception for God\nis a matter of having direct or immediate knowledge. Combining these\ntwo ideas, Anselm could say that God is present everywhere in virtue\nof having immediate knowledge of what is happening everywhere. Brian\nLeftow (1989) objects to the details of this interpretation and\nproposes instead that, for Anselm, God is everywhere in virtue of his\npower. We will explore the combination of knowledge and power below.\nIt should be noted, however, as Christopher Conn (2011) emphasizes,\nthat Anselm himself discusses time in conjunction with space; perhaps\nan adequate interpretation of Anselm would exploit this idea and\ndevelop an account, as Conn suggests, according to which God\n\u201ccontains\u201d all of space-time.\n\nThe two ideas of knowledge and power figure prominently in the account\nof omnipresence given by\n Thomas Aquinas\n (1225\u20131274), which we will take up in the next section. Section\n3 will consider two 20th century proposals very much in the spirit of\nAquinas\u2019s. Some treatments of the problem of omnipresence seem\nto have the consequence that God is related to the world as though it\nis his body. That will be the subject of Section 4. In Section 5\nwe will consider several recent proposals that depart from the\ntraditional formula.\n2. Power, Knowledge, and Essence\n\nAccording to Thomas Aquinas, God\u2019s presence is to be understood\nin terms of God\u2019s power, knowledge and essence. (In this view he\nfollowed a formula put forth by Peter Lombard (late 11th\nC.\u20131160) in his Sentences, I, xxxvii, 1.) He writes,\n\u201cGod is in all things by his power, inasmuch as all things are\nsubject to his power; he is by his presence in all things, inasmuch as\nall things are bare and open to his eyes; he is in all things by his\nessence, inasmuch as he is present to all as the cause of their\nbeing\u201d (Summa Theologica I, 8, 3). Aquinas attempts to\nmotivate this claim with some illustrations:\n\nBut how he [God] is in other things created by him may be considered\nfrom human affairs. A king, for example, is said to be in the whole\nkingdom by his power, although he is not everywhere present. Again, a\nthing is said to be by its presence in other things which are subject\nto its inspection; as things in a house are said to be present to\nanyone, who nevertheless may not be in substance in every part of the\nhouse. Lastly, a thing is said to be substantially or essentially in\nthat place in which its substance is.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a sense in which a king is present wherever his power\nextends. In any event, Aquinas seems to think so. He distinguishes two\nkinds of being in place: by \u201ccontact of dimensive quantity, as\nbodies are, [and] contact of power\u201d (S.T. I, 8, 2, ad\n1). In Summa contra Gentiles he writes that \u201can\nincorporeal thing is related to its presence in something by its\npower, in the same way that a corporeal thing is related to its\npresence in something by dimensive quantity,\u201d and he adds that\n\u201cif there were any body possessed of infinite dimensive\nquantity, it would have to be everywhere. So if there were an\nincorporeal being possessed of infinite power, it must be\neverywhere\u201d (SCG III, 68, 3). So the first aspect of\nGod\u2019s presence in things is his having power over them. The\nsecond aspect is having every thing present to him, having\neverything \u201cbare and open to his eyes\u201d or being known to\nhim. The third feature, that God is present in things by his essence,\nis glossed as his being the cause of their being, (although Ross Inman\n(2021) argues that a fuller account within the Christian tradition\ntreats the role of essence here as deriving explanatorily from a prior\nattribute of ubiquity).\n\nThis way of understanding God\u2019s presence by reference to his\npower and his knowledge treats the predicate \u2018is present\u2019\nas applied to God as analogical with its application to\nordinary physical things. (For a fuller explanation of analogical\npredication, see\n Medieval Theories of Analogy.)\n As applied to God, \u2018is present\u2019 is neither univocal (used\nwith the same meaning as in ordinary contexts) nor equivocal (used\nwith an unrelated meaning). Rather, its meaning can be explained by\nreference to its ordinary sense: God is present at a place just in\ncase there is a physical object that is at that place and God has\npower over that object, knows what is going on in that object, and God\nis the cause of that object\u2019s existence. Nicholas Everitt (2010,\np. 86) objects to this analogical approach, stating that \u201cif\nthis is how omnipresence is interpreted, one might well think that it\nwould be clearer to say straightforwardly that God is not omnipresent\nat all,\u201d and he cites Joshua Hoffman and Gary Rosenkrantz (2002,\np. 41)) as agreeing with him. But Hoffman and Rosenkrantz in the cited\npassage merely say that \u201cthere is no literal sense in\nwhich [God] could be omnipresent,\u201d which leaves it open that\nthere is an analogical sense in which God is omnipresent. Hud Hudson\n(2009) also denies that God\u2019s presence is analogical, but that\nis because he thinks that there is a literal way in which God is\npresent everywhere. We will consider Hudson\u2019s proposal in\nSection 5.\n\nThis account of omnipresence has the consequence that, strictly\nspeaking, God is only present where some physical thing is located.\nPerhaps, however, this is exactly what the medievals had intended.\nAnselm says, for example, that \u201cthe supreme Nature is more\nappropriately said to be everywhere, in this sense, that it is in all\nexisting things, than in this sense, namely that it is merely in all\nplaces\u201d (Monologion, 23).\n3. Two Recent Traditional Treatments\n\nMore recent philosophers have agreed that God\u2019s presence is to\nbe understood analogically.\n Charles Hartshorne\n (1897\u20132000), for example, claims that \u201cthe relation of\nGod to the world must necessarily be conceived, if at all, by analogy\nwith relations given in human experience\u201d (1941). Rather than\ntaking the relations to be knowledge of and power over things,\nhowever, Hartshorne assumes that God\u2019s relation to the world is\nanalogous to that of a human mind\u2019s relation to its body.\n\nHartshorne develops this idea by making distinctions between kinds of\nknowledge and kinds of power. Some things that human beings know are\nknown immediately, by \u201cvivid and direct intuition\u201d, while\nother things are known only indirectly or through inference.\nHartshorne holds that the former kind of knowledge is infallible, and\nit is the kind of knowledge human beings have of their own thoughts\nand feelings. Since this kind of knowledge is the highest form of\nknowledge, it is the kind God has, and he has it with respect to the\nentire cosmos.\n\nSimilarly, some things human beings have power over they control\ndirectly; other things can be controlled only indirectly. Human beings\nhave direct control only over their own volitions and movements of\ntheir own bodies. Again, since this is the highest kind of power, it\nis the kind of power God has\u2014and he has it over every part of\nthe universe.\n\nThus far Hartshorne may be seen as developing the medieval view of\ndivine presence. God is present everywhere by having\nimmediate knowledge and direct power throughout the\nuniverse (with the addition that his presence extends to unoccupied\nregions of space). But Hartshorne endorses a surprising addition. He\nadds that whatever part of the world a mind knows immediately and\ncontrols directly is, by definition, its body. The world, therefore,\nis God\u2019s body.\n\nRichard Swinburne (1977) also begins his discussion of omnipresence by\nasking what it is for a person to have a body. Although he insists\nthat God is an immaterial spirit, he supposes this claim to be\ncompatible with a certain \u201climited embodiment.\u201d\nSubsequently (2016) he withdraws this suggestion, saying that since\n\u201cGod is not supposed to be tied down to acting or learning\nthrough \u2026 [the universe] or any chunk of matter \u2026 it\nseems less misleading to say that he is not embodied.\u201d Swinburne\ndevelops his account by appeal to the notions of a \u201cbasic\naction\u201d (an action one performs, for example, moving ones limbs\nin the typical case, without having to perform another action in order\nto do it) and of \u201cdirect knowledge\u201d (knowledge that is\nneither inferential nor dependent on causal interaction). He then\npresents the claim that God is omnipresent as the claim that God\n\u201ccan cause effects at every place directly (as an instrumentally\nbasic action) and knows what is happening at every place without the\ninformation coming to him through some causal chain\u2014for example,\nwithout needing light rays from a distant place to stimulate his\neyes\u201d (2016, p. 113). Swinburne\u2019s account is thus, as he\nnotes, in the spirit of that of Aquinas.\n4. The World as God\u2019s Body\n\nAs we have seen, Hartshorne explicitly endorses as a consequence of\nthe doctrine of divine omnipresence that the world is God\u2019s\nbody, and Swinburne is initially willing to accept a \u201climited\nembodiment.\u201d But some philosophers have been loath to accept\ndivine embodiment as a consequence of omnipresence. Charles\nTaliaferro, for example, while endorsing this overall account of\nomnipresence, notes that the basic actions human beings perform\n\u201ccan involve highly complex physical factors\u2026[including]\nmany neural events and muscle movements, whereas with God there is no\nsuch physical complexity\u201d (Taliaferro, 1994). Taliaferro then\nadds that this immediacy in the case of God\u2019s action is\nprecisely a reason to say that \u201cthe world does not function as\nGod\u2019s body the way material bodies function as our own.\u201d\nEdward Wierenga adds a second objection. He holds that as Hartshorne\nand Swinburne develop accounts of God\u2019s power and knowledge, God\nwould have the same knowledge of and control over what happens in\nempty regions of space as he does with respect to those regions\noccupied by material objects (Wierenga, 2010). In other words,\nHartshorne\u2019s and Swinburne\u2019s accounts of omnipresence,\nunlike that of Aquinas, do not interpret God\u2019s presence as\npresence in things. But it would be implausible to count a\nthing as part of God\u2019s body on the basis of his knowledge of and\npower over the region of space that thing occupies, when God\u2019s\nknowledge and power would extend in the same way to that region if it\nwere unoccupied. So it seems as though one could accept a version of\nthe traditional account of divine omnipresence without having to\nconclude that the world is God\u2019s body.\n5. Some Recent Alternative Proposals\n\nAlthough conceiving of omnipresence in terms of power, knowledge, and\nessence is the traditional approach, with continued adherents, in\nrecent years several philosophers have proposed quite different\naccounts of omnipresence.\n\nRobert Oakes (2006) suggests that space is \u201cconstituted\nby\u201d God\u2019s omnipresence. He holds that things located in\nspace and the world itself are therefore distinct from God. Oakes then\ndraws on these claims to argue that divine omnipresence is\nincompatible with\n pantheism.\n\nSome recent work appeals to esoteric concepts from metaphysics. Luco\nJohan van den Brom (1984; see also 1993) suggests that \u201cGod has\na spatial dimension of his own which he does not share with\nthe created cosmos.\u201d Brom\u2019s idea is that just as a\ntwo-dimensional surface \u201ctranscends\u201d a line on that\nsurface but is present at every point on the line, and similarly for a\nthree-dimensional space and a two-dimensional plane in that space,\n\u201cGod, by existing in a higher dimensional system, is also\npresent in the places of all the objects in the three-dimensional\nspace of created cosmos without being contained by that\nthree-dimensional space\u201d (1984, p. 654). Brom even conjectures\nthat God possesses at least two extra dimensions, making it impossible\nfor our space to bisect his.\n\nOther recent work draws on contemporary discussions on the metaphysics\nof material objects and their relation to spacetime. Hud Hudson (2009)\ndescribes several possible \u201coccupation\u201d relations. One of\nthese relations is \u201centension\u201d, where an object\nentends a region r just in case it is wholly and\nentirely located at r and also wholly located at every proper\nsubregion of r. An object is entirely located at a\nregion r just in case it is located at r and there\nis no region disjoint from r at which it is located. And an\nobject is wholly located at r just in case it is located\nat r and no proper part of it is not located\nat r. The typical way in which an object is located at a\nregion of space is by having various of its parts at different\nsubregions of that region; that is, typically material objects are\n\u201cspread out\u201d or distributed through a region they occupy\n(they \u201cpertend\u201d, to use a technical term). In contrast, if\nan object entends a region, then it is located as a whole\nthroughout that region. Hudson then proposes a \u201cliteral\noccupation account of omnipresence as ubiquitous entension\u201d\n(2009, p. 209). Omnipresence is location at \u201cthe maximally\ninclusive region\u201d plus being wholly located at every subregion\nthere is. Alexander R. Pruss (2013) also endorses a version of this\naccount, with slightly different details to allow explicitly for\ndivine timelessness. In Hudson\u2019s view, any object that occupies\na region in space is a material object. He is thus willing to accept\nas a consequence of his account of omnipresence as ubiquitous\nentension that God is a material object. Ross Inman (2017), while\nsympathetic to the appeal to ubiquitous entension, is unwilling to\naccept the conclusion that God is a material object. Accordingly he\nshows that careful attention to medieval discussions of the\ndistinction between material and immaterial objects yields at least\nthree ways of marking that distinction according to which God is not\nmaterial.\n\nEleonore Stump (2010, see also 2008, 2011, 2013) defends adding\nadditional conditions to the traditional understanding of omnipresence\nin terms of knowledge and power. She writes, \u201cI \u2026 think,\nhowever, that the attempt to capture personal presence in terms of\ndirect and unmediated cognitive and casual contact misses something\neven in the minimal sense of personal presence\u201d (2010, p. 111).\nShe continues, \u201cwhat has to be added to the condition of direct\nand unmediated casual and cognitive contact \u2026 are two\nthings\u2013\u2013namely, second-person experience and shared\nattention\u201d (2010, p. 112). Second-person experience involves\nbeing aware of and attending to someone else as a person when that\nother person is conscious and functioning as a person. Shared\nattention requires that two persons be aware of each other and aware\nof their awareness, whether of each other or a third object.\nStump\u2019s goal is to provide an understanding of the kind of union\nto be desired in love. It may be, then, that her real topic is the\nnature of God\u2019s offer of love to people. But she explicitly\napplies her remarks about personal presence to omnipresence when she\nwrites, \u201cin order for God to be omnipresent, that is, in order\nfor God to be always and everywhere present, it also needs to\nbe the case that God is always and everywhere in a position to share\nattention with any creature able and willing to share attention with\nGod\u201d (2010, p. 117). Perhaps, then, Stump can be seen not only\nas attempting to analyze omnipresence but to identify what is required\nfor it to be of religious or theological importance.\n\nGeorg Gasser (2019) also defends adding an additional condition\ninvolving agency to the traditional appeal to knowledge and power. He\nconsiders a variety of proposed accounts of omnipresence, giving\nspecial attention (and initial sympathy) to Hudson\u2019s development\nof ubiquitous entension. But he concludes that this proposal has a\nhard time explaining \u201cthe biblical tradition and personal\nreligious experiences [according to which] God acts differently at\ndifferent places\u201d (2019, 59). Perhaps he takes Stump\u2019s\nsecond-person attention and shared experience, which he references, to\nprovide the requisite agency, or perhaps he intends such actions as,\nfor example, God\u2019s speaking to Moses in the burning bush and\nalso preventing the consumption of the bush by fire. In any event,\nGasser assumes that omnipresence includes, not only God\u2019s\npresence through his knowledge and power everywhere, but also\n\u201cacting from time to time \u2026 \u2018specially\u2019 in\nmiraculous ways\u201d (2019, p. 60).\n6. Future Directions\n\nIn a recent paper, Sam Cowling and Wesley D. Cray note that \u201c[t]he\nphilosophical literature on omnipresence is vast, though largely\nsituated in the context of Western, monotheistic philosophy of\nreligion\u201d (2017, p. 223). Their own proposal for expanding the\nfield is to develop an account of omnipresence according to which even\nnumbers and pure sets are omnipresent. That will likely strike\nmany as implausible, but their claim about the limited scope of\ntraditional work on the topic is accurate. In fact they could\nhave mentioned, more precisely, that the philosophers considered in\nthis entry tend to restrict their attention primarily to\nAugustine, Anselm, and Aquinas, with perhaps an aside to Peter\nLombard. That suggests that one avenue for future research is to\nconsider the work of ancient philosophers as well as early modern and\nlater philosophers. The mention of monotheistic philosophy of\nreligion calls attention to another often overlooked area, namely, the\nwork of Jewish and Islamic philosophers of religion. Finally,\nrecent interest in global philosophy suggests yet other areas into\nwhich work on omnipresence could extend.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Anselm, <em>Monologion</em> and <em>Proslogion</em>, in Brian\nDavies and G.
