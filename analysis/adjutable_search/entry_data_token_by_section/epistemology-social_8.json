Credit economy models\ndraw on game and decision theory to model scientists as rational\ncredit seekers, and then assess the epistemic impacts of the credit\nincentives scientists face. At the heart of much of this work is a\ndebate going back as far as Du Bois (1898) that asks: what is the best\nmotive for an epistemic community? Is it credit seeking or\n\u201cpure\u201d truth seeking? Or some combination of the two?\n\nPhilip Kitcher\u2019s 1990 paper \u201cThe Division of Cognitive\nLabor\u201d argues that scientists divide labor more effectively when\nthey are motivated by credit. Truth seekers might all herd onto the\nmost promising problem in science, while credit seekers will choose\nless popular topics where they are more likely to be the one\ngenerating a finding. Strevens (2003) extends Kitcher\u2019s work by\narguing that an existing feature of credit incentives, the priority\nrule, can lead to an even better division of labor. This is the rule\nwhich stipulates that credit will be allocated only to the scientist\nwho first makes a discovery. Zollman (2018) critiques both of these\nmodels, though, by pointing out that pure truth seekers should be\nhappy if anyone makes new discoveries (while Kitcher and Strevens\nassume that \u201ctruth seekers\u201d are only motivated to find\ntruth themselves). If scientists do not care who makes a discovery,\nthen credit is not needed to motivate division of labor.\n\nOthers point out that the priority rule has its downsides. Higginson\nand Munafo (2016) and Romero (2017) argue that the priority rule\nstrongly disincentivizes scientists from performing replications\nbecause credit is so strongly associated with new, positive findings.\nReplications are often crucial in determining whether new results are\naccurate. Another worry is that the priority rule incentivizes fraud\nand/or sloppy work by those who want to quickly claim credit (Merton\n1973, Casadevall and Fang 2012). Both Zollman (2022\u2014see Other\nInternet Resources) and Heesen (2021) show how fraud can positively\nimpact a scientist\u2019s credit in light of the priority rule. And\nHigginson and Munafo (2016) and Heesen (2018) show that on the\nrealistic assumption that speed of production trades off with quality,\nthe priority rule incentivizes fast, poor, sloppy science. Bright\n(2017a), though, uses a model to point out that credit-seekers who\nfear retaliation may publish more accurate results than truth-seekers\nwho are convinced of some fact, despite their experimental results to\nthe contrary. In other words, a true believer may be just as\nincentivized to commit fraud as someone who simply seeks approval from\ntheir community.\n\nThere is one more worry about the priority rule, which regards unfair\nscientific rewards and their consequences. Merton (1968) described the\n\u201cMatthew Effect,\u201d that pre-eminent scholars often get more\ncredit for work than less famous ones. Strevens (2006) argues that\nthis follows the scientific norm to reward credit based on the benefit\na discovery yields to science and society. Because famous scientists\nare more trusted, their discoveries do more good. Heesen (2017), on\nthe other hand, uses a credit economy model to show how someone who\ngets credit early on due to luck may later accrue more and more credit\nbecause of the Matthew effect. When this kind of compounding luck\nhappens, he argues, the resulting stratification of credit in a\nscientific community does not improve inquiry. Rubin and Schneider\n(2021) and Rubin (2022) add to these worries with network models\nshowing how older, more connected member of the community will tend to\nget unfair credit in cases of multiple discovery as a result of the\ndynamics of information sharing. As they argue, these dynamics will\noften unfairly advantage dominant social groups who tend to be more\nestablished and connected in science.\n\nOn the positive side, besides possible benefits to division of labor,\nthe priority rule incentivizes sharing in science. The communist norm\nstates that scientists will share work promptly and widely, which\nbenefits scientists because they want to establish priority and\nreceive credit. While models show how scientists can be incentivized\nto hide intermediate research to get later credit (Dasgupta and David\n1994), they also show how enough credit can promote communism\n(Banerjee et al. 2014, Heesen 2017b).\n\nThis debate is further complicated by models that look at how credit\ninfluences not just rational decision making, but selective processes\nin science. Credit can impact who remains in a discipline, whose\npractices and ideas become influential, and whose students get jobs.\nSmaldino and McElreath (2016) show how poor methods (like low study\npower) tend to generate false positives and thus credit for those\nusing them. If investigators using these poor methods train their\nstudents into them, and then place those students disproportionately,\nthey will tend to proliferate. Likewise Tiokhin et al. (2021) show how\nselection can drive the proliferation of fast work (using small\nsamples sizes) and O\u2019Connor (2019) shows how it can lead to\nconservative, safe problem choice in science. Others, like Smaldino et\nal. (2019) and Stewart and Plotkin (2021) consider what conditions\nmight promote the selection of good science in light of selection.\n\nAs we have seen, credit economy models help answer questions like:\nwhat is the best credit structure for an epistemic community? And how\ndo we promote true discoveries via incentive systems? As credit\neconomy models show us, designing good epistemic communities is by no\nmeans a trivial task.\n4.3 Epistemic Networks\n\nAnother paradigm, widely used by philosophers to explore social\naspects of epistemology, are epistemic network models. This kind of\nmodel uses networks to explicitly represent social or informational\nties where beliefs, evidence, and testimony can be shared.\n\nThere are different ways to do this. In the social sciences generally,\na popular approach takes a \u201cdiffusion\u201d or\n\u201ccontagion\u201d view of beliefs. A belief or idea is\ntransmitted from individual to individual across their network\nconnections, much like a virus can be transmitted (Rogers 1962). (See\nLacroix et al 2021 for a use of this sort of model in philosophy.)\nAlternatively, agents can start with credences and in successive\nrounds average those credences with their neighbors until reaching a\nsteady state (Golub and Jackson 2010, 2012).\n\nIn these diffusion/contagion models, though, the individuals do not\ngather evidence from the world, share evidence with each other, or\nform beliefs in any sort of rational way. For this reason,\nphilosophers of science have tended to use the network\nepistemology framework introduced by economists Bala and Goyal\n(1998) to model how more rational individuals learn from neighbors.\nThese models start with a collection of agents on a network, who\nchoose from some set of actions or action guiding theories. Agents\nhave beliefs about which action is best, and change these beliefs in\nlight of the evidence they gather from their actions. In addition,\nthey also update on evidence gathered by neighbors in the network,\ntypically using some version of Bayes\u2019 rule. It is in this sense\nthat agents are part of an epistemic community. Figure 1 shows what\nthis might look like. The numbers next to each agent represent their\ndegree of belief in some proposition like \u201cvaccines are\nsafe.\u201d The black agents think this is more likely than not. As\nthis model progresses these agents gather data, which increases their\nneighbors\u2019 degrees of belief in turn.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Agents in a network\nepistemology model use their credences to guide theory testing. Their\nresults change their credences, and those of their neighbors. [An\n extended description of figure 1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nCommunities in this model can develop beliefs that the better theory\n(vaccines are safe) is indeed better, or else they can pre-emptively\nsettle on the worse theory (vaccines cause autism) as a result of\nmisleading evidence. Generally, since networks of agents are sensitive\nto the evidence they gather, they are more likely to figure out the\n\u201ctruth\u201d of which is best (Zollman 2013; Rosenstock et al.\n2017).\n\nZollman (2007, 2010) describes what has now been dubbed the\n\u201cZollman effect\u201d in these models; the surprising\nobservation that it is generically worse for communities to\ncommunicate more (see also, Grim 2009). In tightly connected networks,\nmisleading evidence is widely shared, and may cause the community to\npre-emptively settle on a poor theory. Others find similar results for\ndiverse features of networks that slow consensus and promote diversity\nof investigation, including irrational stubbornness (Zollman 2010,\nFrey and Seselja 2020, Gabriel and O\u2019Connor 2023), using grant\ngiving strategies to promote diversity (Kummerfeld and Zollman 2020,\nWu and O\u2019Connor 2022), and demographic diversity (Wu 2022,\nFazelpour and Steel 2022).\n\nOn the basis of results like these Mayo-Wilson et al. (2011, 2013)\ndefend the \u201cindependence thesis\u201d\u2014that rational\ngroups may be composed of irrational individuals, and rational\nindividuals may constitute irrational groups. This supports central\nclaims from social epistemology espoused by Goldman (1999). Smart\n(2018) calls one direction of this claim\u2014that sometimes\nindividual cognitive vices can improve group performance\u2014\n\u201cMandevillian intelligence.\u201d\n\nOthers have considered how else cognitive biases might impact the\ndevelopment of consensus in these models. Weatherall and\nO\u2019Connor (2018) and Mohseni and Williams (2019) show how\nconformity can prevent the adoption of successful beliefs, or slow\nthis adoption, because agents who conform to their neighbors are often\nunwilling to pass on good information that goes against the grain.\nBoth Olsson (2013) and O\u2019Connor and Weatherall (2018) consider\nnetwork models where actors instead place less trust in the evidence\n(or testimony) of those who do not share their beliefs. This can lead\nto stable, polarized camps that each ignore evidence and testimony\ncoming from the other camp.\n\nThese latter models relate to other work attempting to show how\npolarization might arise in epistemic communities not from biases, but\nfrom more rational forms of updating. Singer et al. (2019) show how\nagents who exchange reasons for beliefs, but reject reasons that do\nnot cohere with their beliefs, can polarize. Jern et al. (2014) show\nhow actors who hold causally or probabilistically related beliefs can\npolarize in light of the same new evidence. This observation is\nextended and explored by Freeborn (2023a) and Freeborn (2023b) who\nconsiders how networks of agents who share information and hold\nmultiple beliefs can polarize and factionalize. Dorst (2023) provides\na model where mostly rational agents can polarize in response to the\nsame evidence, and in ways that are predictable.\n\nOther literature investigates the role of pernicious influencers,\nespecially from industry, on epistemic communities. Holman and Bruner\n(2015) develop a network model where one agent shares only fraudulent\nevidence meant to support an inferior theory. As they show, this agent\ncan keep a network from reaching successful consensus by muddying the\nwater with misleading data. Holman and Bruner (2017) show how industry\ncan shape the output of a community through \u201cindustrial\nselection\u201d\u2014funding only agents whose methods bias them\ntowards preferred findings. Weatherall et al. (2020) and Lewandowsky\net al. (2019) show how a propagandist can mislead public agents simply\nby sharing a biased sample of the real results produced in an\nepistemic network. Together these papers give insight into how\nstrategies that do not involve fraud can shape scientific research and\nmislead the public.\n\nOne truth about epistemic communities is that relationships matter.\nThese are the ties that ground testimony, disagreement, and trust.\nEpistemic network models allow philosophers to explore processes of\ninfluence in social networks, yield insights into why social ties\nmatter to the way communities form beliefs, and think about how to\ncreate better knowledge systems.\n4.4 Modeling Diversity in Epistemic Communities\n\nDiversity has emerged several times in our discussion of formal social\nepistemology. Credit incentives can encourage scientists to choose a\ndiversity of problems. In network models, a transient diversity of\nbeliefs is necessary for good inquiry. Let us now turn to models that\ntackle the influence of diversity more explicitly. It has been\nsuggested that cognitive diversity benefits epistemic communities\nbecause a group where members start with different assumptions, use\ndifferent methodologies, or reason in different ways may be more\nlikely to find truth.\n\nWeisberg and Muldoon (2009) introduce a model where actors investigate\nan \u201cepistemic landscape\u201d\u2014a grid where each section\nrepresents a problem in science, of varying epistemic importance.\nFigure 2 shows an example of such a landscape. Learners are randomly\nscattered on the landscape, and follow search rules that are sensitive\nto this importance. Investigators can then ask: how well did these\nlearners do? Did they fully search the landscape? Did they find the\npeaks? And: do communities with diverse search strategies outperform\ncommunities with uniform ones?\n\n\n\nFigure 2: An epistemic landscape.\nLocation represents problem choice, and height represents epistemic\nsignificance.\n\n\nWeisberg and Muldoon argue that a combination of\n\u201cfollowers\u201d (who work on problems similar to other\nindividuals) and \u201cmavericks\u201d (who prefer to explore new\nterrain) do better than either group alone; i.e., there is a benefit\nto cognitive diversity. Their modeling choices and main result have\nbeen convincingly criticized (Alexander et al. 2015; Thoma 2015;\nPoyh\u00f6nen 2017; Fern\u00e1ndez Pinto and Fern\u00e1ndez Pinto\n2018), but the framework has been co-opted by other philosophers to\nuseful ends. Thoma (2015) and Poyh\u00f6nen (2017), for instance, show\nthat in modified versions of the model, cognitive diversity indeed\nprovides the sort of benefit Weisberg and Muldoon hypothesize.\n\nHong and Page (2004) (and following work) use a simple model to derive\ntheir famous \u201cDiversity Trumps Ability\u201d result. Agents\nface a simple epistemic landscape \u2014 a ring with some number of\nlocations on it, each associated with a number representing its\ngoodness as a solution. An agent is represented as a finite set of\nintegers, such as \u27e83, 7, 10\u27e9. Such an agent is placed on the\nring, and can move to locations 3, 7, and 10 spots ahead of their\ncurrent position, assuming it improves their position. The central\nresult is that randomly selected groups of agents who tackle the task\ntogether tend to outperform groups created of top performers. This is\nbecause the top performers have similar integers, and thus gain\nrelatively little from group membership, whereas random agents have a\ngreater variety of integers. This result has been widely cited, though\nthere have been criticisms of the model either as insufficient to show\nsomething so complicated, as lacking crucial representational\nfeatures, or as failing to show what it claims (Thompson 2014; Singer\n2019).\n\nTo this point we have addressed cognitive diversity. But we might also\nbe interested in diversity of social identity in epistemic\ncommunities. Social diversity is an important source of cognitive\ndiversity, and for this reason can benefit the functioning of\nepistemic groups. For instance, different life histories and\nexperiences may lead individuals to hold different assumptions and\ntackle different research programs (Haraway 1989; Longino 1990;\nHarding 1991; Hong and Page 2004). If so, then we may want to know:\nwhy are some groups of people often excluded from epistemic\ncommunities like those in academia? And what might we do about\nthis?\n\nIn recent work, scholars have used models of bargaining to represent\nacademic collaboration. They have shown 1) how the emergence of\nbargaining norms across social identity groups can lead to\ndiscrimination with respect to credit sharing in collaboration (Bruner\nand O\u2019Connor 2017; O\u2019Connor and Bruner 2019) and 2) why\nthis may lead some groups to avoid academia, or else cluster in\ncertain subfields (Rubin and O\u2019Connor 2018). In addition, in the\ncredit-economy tradition, Bright (2017b) and Hengel (2022) provide\nmodels showing how women may be less productive if they reasonably\nexpect more stringent criticism of their work, and react\nrationally.\n\nAs we have seen in this section, models can help explain how and when\ncognitive diversity might matter to the production of knowledge by a\ncommunity. They can also tell us something about why epistemic\ncommunities often, nonetheless, fail to be diverse with respect to\nsocial identity.\n5. Social Epistemology and Society\n\nLet us now move on to see how topics from social epistemology\nintersect with important questions about the proper functioning of\ndemocratic societies, and questions about the dysfunctions in the\nsocial practices bound up in our quest for knowledge.\n5.1 The Social Epistemology of Democracies\n\nA good deal of social epistemology focuses on topics in political\nepistemology.\n\nA large portion of this work is devoted to evaluating the epistemic\nproperties of democratic institutions and practices, falling within\nwhat Alvin Goldman (2010) labeled \u201csystems-oriented\u201d\nsocial epistemology. By a \u201csystem\u201d he meant some entity\nwith various working components and multiple goals. System-oriented\nsocial epistemology asks how best to design systems whose goals\ninclude epistemic goods such as the production or distribution of\nknowledge or true belief. A number of theorists have pursued this\nresearch programme, examining various institutions in democratic\npolitical systems (see e.g. Zollman (2015), Fallis and Matheson\n(2019), O\u2019Connor and Weatherall (2019), Miller (2020), and\nFrost-Arnold (2021).)\n\nThe systems-oriented research programme in social epistemology has\nalso been brought to bear on more general questions regarding\ndemocratic politics. Elizabeth Anderson (2006), for example, addresses\nhow the epistemic properties of democratic systems can be designed to\nattain the best possible form of democracy. She provides three\nepistemic models of democracy: the Condorcet Jury Theorem, the\nDiversity Trumps Ability result, and John Dewey\u2019s\nexperimentalism. Anderson herself plumps for Dewey\u2019s\nexperimentalist approach, while several others argue for voting\naggregation and the Condorcet Jury Theorem (List and Goodin 2001;\nLandemore 2011), and Singer (2019) defends a version of diversity\ntrumps ability (albeit in connection with scientific teams). By\ncontrast, Claudio Lopez-Guerra (2010), H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Landemore\n(2013) and Alex Guerrero (2014) defend a lottery system for selecting\npolitical representatives, contending that the policies that would\nresult would be better than those arrived at through voting. (Estlund\n2008 rejects the core idea of systems-oriented social\nepistemology\u2014 that the epistemic goodness of democratic politics\nis to be sought in the quality of its outcomes\u2014arguing instead\nthat it should be sought in the legitimacy of its procedures.)\n\nPolitically-oriented social epistemologists have also written\nextensively on the epistemic properties of public deliberation. Since\nJohn Stuart Mill\u2019s On Liberty, there has been a long\nhistory of attempts to argue for free speech rights on epistemic\ngrounds. This discussion has continued, albeit with many recent\nauthors casting a more skeptical eye. Some, recognizing the pitfalls\nof deliberation under conditions of oppression, continue to defend the\nepistemic potential of deliberation to illuminate social problems\n(Young 2000; Anderson 2010).\n\nIn addition, there is a lively discussion about the role of experts in\ndemocratic politics. One question concerns how non-experts are to\nidentify experts (Goldman 2001 is the locus classicus).\nAnother question concerns how to balance reliance on experts with\ndemocracy\u2019s commitment to deliberation and equality (see e.g.\nKitcher 2011). There is also a question regarding how to square the\ndemocratic legitimacy conferred by public deliberation among equals\nwith the distinctive epistemic authority of experts (see e.g.\nChristiano 2012).\n\nTwo excellent recent handbooks on political epistemology are Hannon\nand De Ridder (2021) and Edenberg and Hannon (2021). (In addition to\nthe topics listed above, these handbooks also delve into such social\nepistemology topics as political disagreement, polarization, and the\nepistemic responsibilities of citizenship.)\n5.2 Misleading Online Content\n\nThe latest challenge confronting the informational state of the public\nis the accelerating spread of misleading content on the internet. Over\nthe last decade it has become increasingly clear that such content is\nwidespread, pernicious, and threatening democratic function.\nPhilosophers have contributed to emerging research on internet\nepistemology in a number of ways. \n\nOne question, relevant to thinking about preventing the harms of\nmisleading content, is how to define and categorize such content. A\ntypical distinction disambiguates misinformation and disinformation,\nwhere the former is false or inaccurate content not intended to\nmislead and the latter is intended to mislead (Fallis 2016, Floridi\n2013). It is increasingly recognized, though, that misleading content\nneed not be false (Fallis 2015, O\u2019Connor and Weatherall 2019),\nleading some to define malinformation which is intended to mislead but\npotentially true or accurate (Wardle and Derakhshan 2017). Others have\nchallenged the idea that disinformation needs to be misleading, as\nopposed to producing ignorance (Simion 2023) or otherwise blocking\nsuccessful action (Harris 2023). Given the variety and complexity in\nmisleading online content, some argue that these terms will always be\nimprecise (Weatherall and O\u2019Connor 2019) or that we should\ncarefully describe relevant epistemic failures in any case\n(Habgood-Coote 2019). \n\nA number of researchers have turned to virtue epistemology to think\nabout epistemic failures related to the internet. This work has\nidentified socially-oriented vices that might increase susceptibility\nto misleading content (and increase its sharing), such as Cassam\n(2018)\u2019s epistemic insouciance, which he describes as a careless\nattitude towards expertise, especially when communicating with others.\nLynch (2018) argues that epistemic arrogance, which involves an\nunwillingness to learn from others, undermines the process of public\ndebate. Meyer et al. (2021), in empirical work, found an association\nbetween high scores on an epistemic vice scale and false belief. And\nPriest (2021) worries about the role of epistemic vices among elites,\nsuch as obstructionism (using overly complex language and theory), and\nhow these vices impact public belief. On the other side, authors like\nPorter et al. (2022) and Koetke et al. (2022) argue for the benefits\nof intellectual humility \u2013 an awareness of one\u2019s own\nlimitations and openness to the possibility of being wrong \u2013 in\ncommunities grappling with internet misinformation.\n\nSocial media connections and algorithms determine what content is seen\nto what degree and by whom. There have been concerns that various\naspects of this process may exacerbate false beliefs. Echo chambers,\nwhere individuals select online connections and spaces that\ncontinually \u201cecho\u201d their own beliefs back to them, may\nlead to polarization and prevent disconfirmation of false beliefs\n(Cinelli et al. 2021). Nguyen (2020) gives a more specific analysis of\necho chambers as actively discrediting of those with different\nbeliefs, and disambiguates these from epistemic bubbles where there is\nselective exposure to confirmatory content without the discrediting of\noutsiders. (This analysis is also in line with the empirical work done\nby Ruiz and Nilson (2023).) Both sorts of effects are worrying.\nExacerbating this are tendencies by algorithms to present users with\ndata and opinions that confirm their beliefs and attitudes, because\nthat is precisely the content that users tend to like. This is\nsometimes called the \u201cfilter bubble\u201d or \u201cinformation\nbubble\u201d effect (though these various phenomena are by no means\nclearly delineated) (Pariser 2011, Kitchens et al. 2020). One response\nmight be that platforms should make structural and algorithmic choices\nthat best promote accurate beliefs among users, but it has been widely\nacknowledged that this goes against platform incentives to increase\nengagement. Another difficulty is that as platforms shape algorithms\nto prevent the spread of disinformation, the producers of\ndisinformation are incentivized to adapt and create new forms of\nmisleading content (O\u2019Connor and Weatherall 2019).\n\nAn ill-informed populace may not be able to effectively represent\ntheir interests in a democratic society. In order to protect\ndemocratic functioning, it will be necessary for those fighting online\nmisinformation to keep adapting with the best tools and theory\navailable to them. This includes understanding social aspects of\nknowledge and belief formation. In other words, social epistemology\nhas much to say to those faced with the challenging task of protecting\ndemocracy from misleading content.\n5.3 Socio-Epistemic Dysfunctions\n\nInfluenced by long-standing work in feminism and critical race theory,\nsocial epistemology has attempted to theorize about various types of\ndysfunction in the social practices through which we aim to generate,\ncommunicate, assess, and preserve knowledge. In this subsection we\nhighlight several of these.\n\nIn one of the most influential works in epistemology in the last two\ndecades, Miranda Fricker (2007) introduced the term \u201cepistemic\ninjustice\u201d to designate the sort of injustice which wrongs a\nsubject in their capacity as a knower. Fricker distinguished two\nkinds. \u201cTestimonial\u201d injustice obtains when (on the basis\nof identity-based prejudice) an audience gives less credence to a\nspeaker than she deserves. (Fricker illustrated this sort of injustice\nwith Tom Robinson, a character in To Kill a Mockingbird whose\ntestimony, as a Black man on trial for raping a white woman, was\nprejudicially rejected by the all-white jury.)\n\u201cHermeneutical\u201d injustice obtains when, owing to social\nforces which reflect the interests of certain social groups, a subject\nlacks the concepts for understanding and/or communicating socially\nsignificant aspects of her own experience. (Fricker\u2019s example is\nthe experience of women before the term \u201csexual\nharassment\u201d was coined.) Fricker\u2019s (2007) reflections on\nepistemic injustice have inspired a generation of social philosophers\nto pursue questions in this vicinity. Some have sought to amend or\nqualify Fricker\u2019s definitions (Medina 2011, Mason 2011, Anderson\n2012, Davis 2016, Lackey 2018, Maitra 2018), while others have\nemployed one or another notion of epistemic injustice in new domains,\nincluding social or political contexts (Medina 2012, Dular 2021),\nhealth care (Carel and Kidd 2014), education (Kotzee 2017), and\ncriminal law (Lackey 2023).\n\nA second type of socio-epistemic dysfunction of significant interest\nto social epistemologists is ignorance. Influenced by the seminal work\nof Sandra Harding (1991), Michelle Moody-Adams (1994), Charles Mills\n(1997, 2007), Patricia Hill Collins (2000), Nancy Tuana (2004, 2006),\nKristie Dotson (2011), and Gaile Pohlhaus (2012), among others, social\nepistemologists have begun to characterize how\nignorance\u2014understood as involving either false belief or lack of\ninformation\u2014is distributed, and sometimes willfully maintained,\nin communities. The guiding hypothesis, explicitly formulated by Mills\n(2007) in connection with his notion of \u201cwhite ignorance,\u201d\nis that ignorance in contemporary society patterns in ways that\nreflect the interests of dominant social groups. (Because Mills,\nDotson, and others have argued that this sort of ignorance can be\nwillfully maintained through certain social arrangements, it can be\nsomewhat misleading to label this a \u201cdysfunction.\u201d)\nInteresting work has been done in the \u201cepistemology of\nignorance\u201d in connection with women\u2019s health (Tuana 2004),\nmatters of race (Sullivan and Tuana 2007), gender oppression (Gilson\n2011), and trust in social media (Frost-Arnold (2016)), among other\nareas. This work makes clear that the ignorant subject often lacks\nevidence she ought to have. As such, it challenges the\ntraditional idea that the focus of epistemic assessment should be\nrestricted to how well a subject does with the evidence she has. For\nthis reason, the acquisition and handling of evidence, long a topic in\nfeminist and virtue epistemology, has recently begun to attract the\nattention of social epistemologists as well. (For discussion see\nGoldberg 2017, Lackey 2020, Simion 2021, Woodard and Flores 2023).\n\nTo be sure, there are many other types of dysfunction that are\ndiscussed by social epistemologists. We have already mentioned several\nof these above: misleading online content, polarization, bias, and\necho chambers. Beyond these, social epistemologists have been\ndeveloping concepts for additional types. A general framework for\nunderstanding various dimensions of epistemic oppression can be found\nin Dotson (2014). Regarding additional types themselves, Abramson\n(2014) and McKinnon (2017) treat gaslighting as a socio-epistemic\ndysfunction in which one person consistently questions another\u2019s\nsanity or competence in order to destroy the victim\u2019s\nself-confidence and undermine her sense of self (Ru\u00edz 2020\ndevelops the cultural analogue of this phenomenon); Stanley (2015)\npresents a wide-ranging discussion of propaganda, including its\nsocio-epistemic dimensions; Berenstain (2016) introduces the notion of\nepistemic exploitation, the phenomenon in which members of\nunderrepresented groups are burdened by the expectation of informing\ndominant group members about their experiences; Davis (2018) develops\nthe notion of \u201cepistemic appropriation,\u201d the epistemic\nanalogue of cultural appropriation; Ballantyne (2019) discusses\n\u201cepistemic trespassing,\u201d wherein experts assume authority\nand speak on topics beyond their expertise; and Leydon-Hardy (2021)\nidentifies \u201cepistemic infringement\u201d as the phenomenon in\nwhich one person undermines the epistemic agency of another by\nviolating social and epistemic norms.",
