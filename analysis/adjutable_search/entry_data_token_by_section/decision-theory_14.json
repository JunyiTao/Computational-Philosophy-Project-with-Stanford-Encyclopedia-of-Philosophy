    "main_text": "Sequential decisions\n6. Sequential decisions\n\nThe decision theories of Savage and Jeffrey, as well as those of their\ncritics, apparently concern a single or \u201cone shot only\u201d\ndecision; at issue is an agent\u2019s preference ordering, and\nultimately her choice of act, at a particular point in time. One may\nrefer to this as a static decision problem. The question\narises as to whether this framework is adequate for handling more\ncomplex scenarios, in particular those involving a series or sequence\nof decisions; these are referred to as sequential decision\nproblems.\n\nOn paper, at least, static and sequential decision models look very\ndifferent. The static model has familiar tabular or normal\nform, with each row representing an available act/option, and columns\nrepresenting the different possible states of the world that yield a\ngiven outcome for each act. The sequential decision model, on the\nother hand, has tree or extensive form (such as in\n Figure 1).\n It depicts a series of anticipated choice points, where the branches\nextending from a choice point represent the options at that choice\npoint. Some of these branches lead to further choice points, often\nafter the resolution of some uncertainty due to new evidence.\n\nThese basic differences between static and sequential decision models\nraise questions about how, in fact, they relate to each other:\n\n\n\nDo static and sequential decision models depict the same kind of\ndecision problem? If so, what is the static counterpart of a\nsequential decision model?\n\n\nDoes the sequential decision setting reveal any further\n(dis)advantages of EU theory? More generally does this setting shed\nlight on normative theories of choice?\n\n\nThese questions turn out to be rather controversial. They will be\naddressed in turn, after the scene has been set with an old story\nabout Ulysses.\n",
