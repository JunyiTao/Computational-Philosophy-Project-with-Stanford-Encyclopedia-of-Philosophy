First, atomism of any kind\u2014that is, any doctrine that\nstipulates basic indivisible buiding blocks exist whose\nidentities are independent of the relations and wholes into which they\nmay enter\u2014is rejected as unintelligible, and a thorough contextualism\nasserted: things can only be determinate in relation to a context, and\nthere can be no non-arbitrary limiting of the extent and multiplicity\nof contexts, since each context will itself be intelligible only with\nrespect to a larger context. This would seem to lead to a holism of\nsome sort: each apparently isolable thing is really an aspect or\nexpression of some more inclusive whole, and each of these finite\nwholes must be an aspect or expression of a still more inclusive\nwhole. The part is dependent on the whole, the conditional is\ndependent on the unconditional. But the unconditional can have no\nspecific separate identity, not even as \u201cthe unconditional\nper se\u201d. Any determination for the whole turns out to\nself-overturn into other determinations, precisely due to its success\nin being a determination for the exceptionless whole. For example,\nThales says the world is made of water. This is stipulated after first\nisolating other lesser wholes: water, earth, fire, air. Each of these\nwas already a finite whole, involving an alleged collapse from\nappearance to a deeper reality: what appeared to be trees and stones\nand pillars turned out to be part of the larger whole\n\u201cearth\u201d, ways in which earth appears or manifests; what\nappeared to be body-heat and flames and sunshine turned out to be part\nof the larger whole \u201cfire\u201d, ways in which fire appears or\nmanifests. Now Thales says both of these are really parts of a larger\nwhole \u201cwater\u201d, ways in which it appears and manifests. But\neach of these generalizing claims involves a meaning-change\nfor the term in question. \u201cWater\u201d initially meant\n\u201cwhat is not fire, earth, wind, which excludes them,\nwhat is contrasted to them\u201d. After Thales, \u201cwater\u201d\nmeans also \u201cwhat expresses itself sometimes as watery, sometimes\nas fiery, sometimes as earthy, sometimes as windy\u201d. Along comes\nHeraclitus and claims that all is really \u201cfire\u201d.\n\u201cFire\u201d now means also \u201cwhat expresses itself\nsometimes as watery, sometimes as fiery, sometimes as earthy,\nsometimes as windy\u201d. What is intended in claims of this type,\nallowing them to appear to be doing explanatory work, is the\nmaintenance of a distinction between which of these expressions is\nprimary and which secondary, which direct and indirect; but Tiantai\nwould deny that this distinction can be meaningfully maintained once\nthis totalization has been effected. Because each now means the whole,\nthey lose their original meaning, for that meaning was entirely\ndependent on a contrast to what was excluded. If fire is everything,\nthen fire is not fire. If water is everything, then water is not\nwater. If fire is everything, then water is really fire. If water is\neverything, then fire is really water. If fire is really water, then\nwater is really fire. Hence by going through the universalization of\nany determinate entity, we reach the overturning of that\ndetermination into something that expresses itself as all other\ndeterminations, and at the same time undermines its own privileged\nstatus as ultimate foundation, making all other possible\ndeterminations equally unconditional, all-pervasive, universal,\nabsolute. To see the absoluteness of any one entity is thus to\nde-absolutize that entity and also to absolutize every other\nentity.\n",
