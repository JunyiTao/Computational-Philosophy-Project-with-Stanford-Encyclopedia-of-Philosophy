Second Wave Feminist Analyses of Housework\n\nIn the second wave movement, theorists can be grouped by their theory\nof how housework oppresses women. Typically, liberal feminists\ncritique housework because it is unpaid. This makes women dependent on\nmen and devalued, since their work is outside the meaningful sphere of\npublic economic production (Friedan 1963). Marxist feminist theorists\nsee this as part of the problem, but some go further to maintain that\nhousework is part of a household feudal mode of production of goods\nfor use that persists under capitalism and gives men feudal powers\nover women\u2019s work (Benston 1969, Fox 1980). Other Marxist\nfeminists argue that women\u2019s housework is part of the social\nreproduction of capitalism (Federici 1975, 2004; Malos 1975; Vogel\n1995). That the necessary work of reproducing the working class is\nunpaid allows more profits to capitalists. It is the sexual division\nof labor in productive and reproductive work that makes woman unequal\nto men and allows capitalists to exploit women\u2019s unpaid labor.\nSome even make this analysis the basis for a demand for wages for\nhousework (Dalla Costa 1974; Federici 1975). More recently, Federici\nhas done an analysis of the transition to capitalism in Europe. She\nargues that it was the emerging capitalist class need to control\nworking class reproduction, to eliminate working class women\u2019s\ncontrol over biological reproduction, and to assure their unpaid\nreproductive work in the home by restricting abortions, that fueled\nthe campaign against witches during this period (Federici 2004).\n\nOne of the philosophical problems raised by the housework debate is\nhow to draw the line between work and play or leisure activity when\nthe activity is not paid: is a mother playing with her baby working or\nengaged in play? If the former, then her hours in such activity may be\ncompared with those of her husband or partner to see if there is an\nexploitation relation present, for example, if his total hours of\nproductive and reproductive work for the family are less than hers\n(cf. Delphy 1984). But to the extent that childrearing counts as\nleisure activity, as play, as activity held to be intrinsically\nvaluable (Ferguson 2004), no exploitation is involved. Perhaps\nchildrearing and other caring activity is both work and play, but only\nthat portion which is necessary for the psychological growth of the\nchild and the worker(s) counts as work. If so, who determines when\nthat line is crossed? Since non-market activity does not have a clear\ncriterion to distinguish work from non-work, nor necessary from\nnon-necessary social labor, an arbitrary element seems to creep in\nthat makes standards of fairness difficult to apply to gendered\nhousehold bargains between men and women dividing up waged and\nnon-waged work. (Barrett 1980).\n\nOne solution to this problem is simply to take all household activity\nthat could also be done by waged labor (nannies, domestic servants,\ngardeners, chauffeurs, etc.) as work and to figure its comparable\nworth by the waged labor necessary to replace it (Folbre 1982, 1983).\nAnother is to reject altogether the attempts to base women\u2019s\noppression on social relations of work, on the grounds that such\ntheories are overly generalizing and ignore the discrete meanings that\nkinship activities have for women in different contexts (Nicholson\n1991; Fraser and Nicholson 1991; Marchand 1995). Or, one can argue\nthat although the line between work and leisure changes historically,\nthose doing the activity should have the decisive say as to whether\ntheir activity counts as work, i.e., labor necessary to promote human\nwelfare. The existence of second wave women\u2019s movements\ncritiques of the \u201csecond shift\u201d of unpaid household\nactivity indicates that a growing number of women see most of it as\nwork, not play (cf. Hochschild 1989). Finally, one can argue that since\nthe human care involved in taking care of children and elders creates\na public good, it should clearly be characterized as work, and those\nwho are caretakers, primarily women, should be fairly compensated for\nit by society or the state (Ferguson and Folbre 2000: Folbre 2000,\nFerguson 2004).\n",
