History\n\nAs has been frequently noted, the ancient Greeks did not have terms or\nconcepts that correspond to the contemporary dichotomy of\n\u2018heterosexual\u2019 and \u2018homosexual\u2019 (e.g.,\nFoucault, 1980). There is a wealth of material from ancient Greece\npertinent to issues of sexuality, ranging from dialogues of Plato,\nsuch as the Symposium, to plays by Aristophanes, and Greek\nartwork and vases. What follows is a brief description of ancient\nGreek attitudes, but it is important to recognize that there was\nregional variation. For example, in parts of Ionia there were general\nstrictures against same-sex eros, while in Elis and Boiotia\n(e.g., Thebes), it was approved of and even celebrated (cf. Dover,\n1989; Halperin, 1990).\n\nProbably the most frequent assumption about sexual orientation, at\nleast by ancient Greek authors, is that persons can respond erotically\nto beauty in either sex. Diogenes Laeurtius, for example, wrote of\nAlcibiades, the Athenian general and politician of the 5th\ncentury B.C., \u201cin his adolescence he drew away the husbands from\ntheir wives, and as a young man the wives from their husbands.\u201d\n(Quoted in Greenberg, 1988, 144) Some persons were noted for their\nexclusive interests in persons of one gender. For example, Alexander\nthe Great and the founder of Stoicism, Zeno of Citium, were known for\ntheir exclusive interest in boys and other men. Such persons, however,\nare generally portrayed as the exception. Furthermore, the issue of\nwhat biological sex one is attracted to is seen as an issue of taste\nor preference, rather than as a moral issue. A character in\nPlutarch\u2019s Erotikos (Dialogue on Love) argues\nthat \u201cthe noble lover of beauty engages in love wherever he sees\nexcellence and splendid natural endowment without regard for any\ndifference in physiological detail\u201d (ibid., 146).\nGender just becomes irrelevant \u201cdetail\u201d and instead the\nexcellence in character and beauty is what is most important.\n\nEven though the gender that one was erotically attracted to (at any\nspecific time, given the assumption that persons will likely be\nattracted to persons of both sexes) was not important, other issues\nwere salient, such as whether one exercised moderation. Status\nconcerns were also of the highest importance. Given that only free men\nhad full status, women and male slaves were not problematic sexual\npartners. Sex between freemen, however, was problematic for status.\nThe central distinction in ancient Greek sexual relations was between\ntaking an active or insertive role, versus a passive or penetrated\none. The passive role was acceptable only for inferiors, such as\nwomen, slaves, or male youths who were not yet citizens. Hence the\ncultural ideal of a same-sex relationship was between an older man,\nprobably in his 20s or 30s, known as the erastes, and a boy\nwhose beard had not yet begun to grow, the eromenos or\npaidika. In this relationship there was courtship ritual,\ninvolving gifts (such as a rooster), and other norms. The\nerastes had to show that he had nobler interests in the boy,\nrather than a purely sexual concern. The boy was not to submit too\neasily, and if pursued by more than one man, was to show discretion\nand pick the more noble one. There is also evidence that penetration\nwas often avoided by having the erastes face his beloved and\nplace his penis between the thighs of the eromenos, which is\nknown as intercrural sex. The relationship was to be temporary and\nshould end upon the boy reaching adulthood (Dover, 1989). To continue\nin a submissive role even while one should be an equal citizen was\nconsidered troubling, although there certainly were many adult male\nsame-sex relationships that were noted and not strongly stigmatized.\nWhile the passive role was thus seen as problematic, to be attracted\nto men was often taken as a sign of masculinity. Greek gods, such as\nZeus, had stories of same-sex exploits attributed to them, as did\nother key figures in Greek myth and literature, such as Achilles and\nHercules. Plato, in the Symposium, argues for an army to be\ncomprised of same-sex lovers. Thebes did form such a regiment, the\nSacred Band of Thebes, formed of 500 soldiers. They were renowned in\nthe ancient world for their valor in battle.\n\nAncient Rome had many parallels to ancient Greece in its understanding\nof same-sex attraction, and sexual issues more generally. This is\nespecially true under the Republic. Yet under the Empire, Roman\nsociety slowly became more negative in its views towards sexuality,\nprobably due to social and economic turmoil, even before Christianity\nbecame influential.\n\nExactly what attitude the New Testament has towards sexuality in\ngeneral, and same-sex attraction in particular, is a matter of sharp\ndebate. John Boswell argues, in his fascinating Christianity,\nSocial Tolerance, and Homosexuality, that many passages taken\ntoday as condemnations of homosexuality are more concerned with\nprostitution, or where same-sex acts are described as\n\u201cunnatural\u201d the meaning is more akin to \u2018out of the\nordinary\u2019 rather than as immoral (Boswell, 1980, ch.4; see also\nBoswell, 1994). Yet others have criticized, sometimes persuasively,\nBoswell\u2019s scholarship, arguing that the conventional\ncontemporary reading is more plausible (see Greenberg, 1988, ch.5).\nWhat is clear, however, is that while condemnation of same-sex\nattraction is marginal to the Gospels and only an intermittent focus\nin the rest of the New Testament, early Christian church fathers were\nmuch more outspoken. In their writings there is a horror at any sort\nof sex, but in a few generations these views eased, in part due no\ndoubt to practical concerns of recruiting converts. By the fourth and\nfifth centuries the mainstream Christian view allowed only for\nprocreative sex.\n\nThis viewpoint, that procreative sex within marriage is allowed, while\nevery other expression of sexuality is sinful, can be found, for\nexample, in St. Augustine. This understanding of permissible sexual\nrelationships leads to a concern with the gender of one\u2019s\npartner that is not found in previous Greek or Roman views, and it\nclearly forbids homosexual acts. Soon this attitude, especially\ntowards homosexual sex, came to be reflected in Roman Law. In\nJustinian\u2019s Code, promulgated in 529, persons who engaged in\nhomosexual sex were to be executed, although those who were repentant\ncould be spared. Historians agree that the late Roman Empire saw a\nrise in intolerance towards homosexuality, although there were again\nimportant regional variations.\n\nWith the decline of the Roman Empire, and its replacement by various\nbarbarian kingdoms, a general tolerance (with the sole exception of\nVisigothic Spain) for homosexual acts prevailed. As one prominent\nscholar puts it, \u201cEuropean secular law contained few measures\nagainst homosexuality until the middle of the thirteenth\ncentury.\u201d (Greenberg, 1988, 260) Even while some Christian\ntheologians continued to denounce nonprocreative sexuality, including\nsame-sex acts, a genre of homophilic literature, especially among the\nclergy, developed in the eleventh and twelfth centuries (Boswell,\n1980, chapters 8 and 9).\n\nThe latter part of the twelfth through the fourteenth centuries,\nhowever, saw a sharp rise in intolerance towards homosexual sex,\nalongside persecution of Jews, Muslims, heretics, and others. While\nthe causes of this are somewhat unclear, it is likely that increased\nclass conflict alongside the Gregorian reform movement in the Catholic\nChurch were two important factors. The Church itself started to appeal\nto a conception of \u201cnature\u201d as the standard of morality,\nand drew it in such a way so as to forbid homosexual sex (as well as\nextramarital sex, nonprocreative sex within marriage, and often\nmasturbation). For example, the first ecumenical council to condemn\nhomosexual sex, Lateran III of 1179, stated \u201cWhoever shall be\nfound to have committed that incontinence which is against\nnature\u201d shall be punished, the severity of which depended upon\nwhether the transgressor was a cleric or layperson (quoted in Boswell,\n1980, 277). This appeal to natural law (discussed below) became very\ninfluential in the Western tradition. An important point to note,\nhowever, is that the key category here is the \u2018sodomite,\u2019\nwhich differs from the contemporary idea of \u2018homosexual\u2019.\nA sodomite was understood as act-defined, rather than as a type of\nperson. Someone who had desires to engage in sodomy, yet did not act\nupon them, was not a sodomite. Also, persons who engaged in\nheterosexual sodomy were also sodomites. There are reports of persons\nbeing burned to death or beheaded for sodomy with a spouse (Greenberg,\n1988, 277). Finally, a person who had engaged in sodomy, yet who had\nrepented of his sin and vowed to never do it again, was no longer a\nsodomite. The gender of one\u2019s partner is again not of decisive\nimportance, although some medieval theologians single out same-sex\nsodomy as the worst type of sexual crime (Crompton, 2003, ch.6).\n\nFor the next several centuries in Europe, the laws against homosexual\nsex were severe in their penalties. Enforcement, however, was\nepisodic. In some regions, decades would pass without any\nprosecutions. Yet the Dutch, in the 1730s, mounted a harsh anti-sodomy\ncampaign (alongside an anti-Roma pogrom), even using torture to\nobtain confessions. As many as one hundred men and boys were executed\nand denied burial (Greenberg, 1988, 313\u20134). Also, the degree to\nwhich sodomy and same-sex attraction were accepted varied by class,\nwith the middle class taking the most restrictive view, while the\naristocracy and nobility often accepted public expressions of\nalternative sexualities. At times, even with the risk of severe\npunishment, same-sex oriented subcultures would flourish in cities,\nsometimes only to be suppressed by the authorities. In the\n19th century there was a significant reduction in the legal\npenalties for sodomy. The Napoleonic code decriminalized sodomy, and\nwith Napoleon\u2019s conquests that Code spread. Furthermore, in many\ncountries where homosexual sex remained a crime, the general movement\nat this time away from the death penalty usually meant that sodomy was\nremoved from the list of capital offenses.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries an overtly\ntheological framework no longer dominated the discourse about same-sex\nattraction. Instead, secular arguments and interpretations became\nincreasingly common. Probably the most important secular domain for\ndiscussions of homosexuality was in medicine, including psychology.\nThis discourse, in turn, linked up with considerations about the state\nand its need for a growing population, good soldiers, and intact\nfamilies marked by clearly defined gender roles. Doctors were called\nin by courts to examine sex crime defendants (Foucault, 1980;\nGreenberg, 1988). At the same time, the dramatic increase in school\nattendance rates and the average length of time spent in school,\nreduced transgenerational contact, and hence also the frequency of\ntransgenerational sex. Same-sex relations between persons of roughly\nthe same age became the norm.\n\nClearly the rise in the prestige of medicine resulted in part from the\nincreasing ability of science to account for natural phenomena on the\nbasis of mechanistic causation. The application of this viewpoint to\nhumans led to accounts of sexuality as innate or biologically driven.\nThe voluntarism of the medieval understanding of sodomy, that\nsodomites chose sin, gave way to the prevailing though contested\nmodern notion of homosexuality as a deep, unchosen characteristic of\npersons, regardless of whether they act upon that orientation. The\nidea of a \u2018latent sodomite\u2019 would not have made sense, yet\nunder this new view it does make sense to speak of a person as a\n\u2018latent homosexual.\u2019 Instead of specific acts defining a\nperson, as in the medieval view, an entire physical and mental makeup,\nusually portrayed as somehow defective or pathological, is ascribed to\nthe modern category of \u2018homosexual.\u2019 Although there are\nhistorical precursors to these ideas (e.g., Aristotle gave a\nphysiological explanation of passive homosexuality), medicine gave\nthem greater public exposure and credibility (Greenberg, 1988, ch.15).\nThe effects of these ideas cut in conflicting ways. Since\nhomosexuality is, by this view, not chosen, it makes less sense to\ncriminalize it. Persons are not choosing evil acts. Yet persons may be\nexpressing a diseased or pathological mental state, and hence medical\nintervention for a cure is appropriate. Hence doctors, especially\npsychiatrists, campaigned for the repeal or reduction of criminal\npenalties for consensual homosexual sodomy, yet intervened to\n\u201crehabilitate\u201d homosexuals. They also sought to develop\ntechniques to prevent children from becoming homosexual, for example\nby arguing that childhood masturbation caused homosexuality, hence it\nmust be closely guarded against.\n\nIn the 20th century sexual roles were redefined once again.\nFor a variety of reasons, premarital intercourse slowly became more\ncommon and eventually acceptable. With the decline of prohibitions\nagainst sex for the sake of pleasure even outside of marriage, it\nbecame more difficult to argue against gay sex. These trends were\nespecially strong in the 1960s, and it was in this context that the\ngay liberation movement took off. Although gay and lesbian rights\ngroups had been around for decades, the low-key approach of the\nMattachine Society (named after a medieval secret society) and the\nDaughters of Bilitis had not gained much ground. This changed in the\nearly morning hours of June 28, 1969, when the patrons of the\nStonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village, rioted after a police\nraid. In the aftermath of that event, gay and lesbian groups began to\norganize around the country. Gay Democratic clubs were created in\nevery major city, and one fourth of all college campuses had gay and\nlesbian groups (Shilts, 1993, ch.28). Large gay urban communities in\ncities from coast to coast became the norm. The American Psychiatric\nAssociation removed homosexuality from its official listing of mental\ndisorders. The increased visibility of gays and lesbians has become a\npermanent feature of American life despite the two critical setbacks\nof the AIDS epidemic and an anti-gay backlash (see Berman, 1993, for a\ngood survey). The post-Stonewall era has also seen marked changes in\nWestern Europe, where the repeal of anti-sodomy laws and legal\nequality for gays and lesbians has become common. In the 21st century,\nthe legal recognition of same-sex marriage has become widespread.\n\nThe increasing acceptance of same-sex relations has prompted new\ntheoretical debates, such as whether a \u201cpost-gay\u201d culture\nwill emerge due to widespread assimilation of gays and lesbians\n(Anderson, 2016). Generally what is meant by the term\n\u201cpost-gay\u201d is that if LGBTQ persons have full legal and\nsocial equality, that level of acceptance makes it so sexual\norientation is no longer a defining aspect of one\u2019s identity or\nsocial position. While it seems unlikely that gay, lesbian, or queer\npersons of color, or who live in rural areas, or are otherwise in a\nmarginalized position will achieve such assimilation in the\nforeseeable future, the debate is still of theoretical interest. For\ninstance, post-gay can be conceptualized as either a specific\npolitical order, characterized by equality across sexual orientations,\nor it can be seen as a specific type of identity, where persons\nunderstand and accept themselves as same-sex oriented but as not in\nany way defined by that. Post-gay can also be a time, an era marked by\nwidespread assimilation, or a space, where persons are fully treated\nas equals. Some regard the variety of meanings given to the term as\nevidence of confusion (Kampler and Connell, 2018). A better\nunderstanding, however, is that the term is being used to rival ends.\nFor some, post-gay marks the culmination of the gay rights movement,\nwhich all along, they contend, was an effort to be treated as equals.\nFor others, it opens a space where sexual labels can be resisted,\nrenegotiated, and made fluid and non-binary (Coleman-Fountain,\n2014).\n2. Historiographical Debates\n\nBroader currents in society have influenced the ways in which scholars\nand activists have approached research into sexuality and same-sex\nattraction. Some early 20th century researchers and\nequality advocates, seeking to vindicate same-sex relations in\nsocieties that disparaged and criminalized it, put forward lists of\nfamous historical figures attracted to persons of the same sex. Such\nlists implied a common historical entity underlying sexual attraction,\nwhether one called it \u2018inversion\u2019 or\n\u2018homosexuality.\u2019 This approach (or perhaps closely related\nfamily of approaches) is commonly called essentialism. Historians and\nresearchers sympathetic to the gay liberation movement of the late\n1960s and 1970s produced a number of books that implicitly relied on\nan essentialist approach. In the 1970s and 1980s John Boswell raised\nit to a new level of methodological and historical sophistication,\nalthough his position shifted over time to one of virtual agnosticism\nbetween essentialists and their critics. Crompton\u2019s work (2003)\nis a notable contemporary example of an essentialist methodology.\n\nEssentialists claim that categories of sexual attraction are observed\nrather than created. For example, while ancient Greece did not have\nterms that correspond to the heterosexual/homosexual division, persons\ndid note men who were only attracted to person of a specific sex,\nhence the lack of terminology need not be taken as evidence of a lack\nof continuity in categories. Through history and across cultures there\nare consistent features, albeit with meaningful variety over time and\nspace, in sexual attraction to the point that it makes sense of speak\nof specific sexual orientations. According to this view, homosexuality\nis a specific, natural kind rather than a cultural or historical\nproduct. Essentialists allow that there are cultural differences in\nhow homosexuality is expressed and interpreted, but they emphasize\nthat this does not prevent it from being a universal category of human\nsexual expression.\n\nIn contrast, in the 1970s and since a number of researchers, often\ninfluenced by Mary McIntosh or Michel Foucault, argued that class\nrelations, the human sciences, and other historically constructed\nforces create sexual categories and the personal identities associated\nwith them. For advocates of this view, such as David Halperin, how sex\nis organized in a given cultural and historical setting is irreducibly\nparticular (Halperin, 2002). The emphasis on the social creation of\nsexual experience and expression led to the labeling of the viewpoint\nas social constructionism, although more recently several of its\nproponents have preferred the term \u2018historicism.\u2019 Thus\nhomosexuality, as a specific sexual construction, is best understood\nas a solely modern, Western concept and role. Prior to the development\nof this construction, persons were not really \u2018homosexual\u2019\neven when they were only attracted to persons of the same sex. The\ndifferences between, say, ancient Greece, with its emphasis on\npederasty, role in the sex act, and social status, and the\ncontemporary Western role of \u2018gay\u2019 or\n\u2018homosexual\u2019 are simply too great to collapse into one\ncategory.\n\nIn a manner closely related to the claims of queer theory, discussed\nbelow, social constructionists argue that specific social constructs\nproduce sexual ways of being. There is no given mode of sexuality that\nis independent of culture; even the concept and experience of sexual\norientation itself are products of history. For advocates of this\nview, the range of historical sexual diversity, and the fluidity of\nhuman possibility, is simply too varied to be adequately captured by\nany specific conceptual scheme.\n\nThere is a significant political dimension to this seemingly abstract\nhistoriographical debate. Social constructionists argue that\nessentialism is the weaker position politically for at least two\nreasons. First, by accepting a basic heterosexual/homosexual\norganizing dichotomy, essentialism wrongly concedes that\nheterosexuality is the norm and that homosexuality is, strictly\nspeaking, abnormal and the basis for a permanent minority. Second,\nsocial constructionists argue that an important goal of historical\ninvestigations should be to put into question contemporary organizing\nschemas about sexuality. The acceptance of the contemporary\nheterosexual/homosexual dichotomy is conservative, perhaps even\nreactionary, and forecloses the exploration of new possibilities.\n(There are related queer theory criticisms of the essentialist\nposition, discussed below.) In contrast, essentialists argue that a\nhistoricist approach forecloses the very possibility of a \u2018gay\nhistory.\u2019 Instead, the field of investigation becomes other\nsocial forces and how they \u2018produce\u2019 a distinct form or\nforms of sexuality. Only an essentialist approach can maintain the\nproject of gay history, and minority histories in general, as a force\nfor liberation.\n3. Natural Law\n\nToday natural law theory offers the most common intellectual defense\nfor differential treatment of gays and lesbians, and as such it merits\nattention. The development of natural law is a long and very\ncomplicated story. A reasonable place to begin is with the dialogues\nof Plato, for this is where some of the central ideas are first\narticulated, and, significantly enough, are immediately applied to the\nsexual domain. For the Sophists, the human world is a realm of\nconvention and change, rather than of unchanging moral truth. Plato,\nin contrast, argued that unchanging truths underpin the flux of the\nmaterial world. Reality, including eternal moral truths, is a matter\nof phusis. Even though there is clearly a great degree of\nvariety in conventions from one city to another (something ancient\nGreeks became increasingly aware of), there is still an unwritten\nstandard, or law, that humans should live under.\n\nIn the Laws, Plato applies the idea of a fixed, natural law\nto sex, and takes a much harsher line than he does in the\nSymposium or the Phraedrus. In Book One he writes\nabout how opposite-sex sex acts cause pleasure by nature, while\nsame-sex sexuality is \u201cunnatural\u201d (636c). In Book Eight,\nthe Athenian speaker considers how to have legislation banning\nhomosexual acts, masturbation, and illegitimate procreative sex widely\naccepted. He then states that this law is according to nature\n(838\u2013839d). Probably the best way of understanding Plato\u2019s\ndiscussion here is in the context of his overall concerns with the\nappetitive part of the soul and how best to control it. Plato clearly\nsees same-sex passions as especially strong, and hence particularly\nproblematic, although in the Symposium that erotic attraction\nis presented as potentially being a catalyst for a life of philosophy,\nrather than base sensuality (Cf. Dover, 1989, 153\u2013170; Nussbaum,\n1999, esp. chapter 12).\n\nOther figures played important roles in the development of natural law\ntheory. Aristotle, with his emphasis upon reason as the distinctive\nhuman function, and the Stoics, with their emphasis upon human beings\nas a part of the natural order of the cosmos, both helped to shape the\nnatural law perspective which says that \u201cTrue law is right\nreason in agreement with nature,\u201d as Cicero put it. Aristotle,\nin his approach, did allow for change to occur according to nature,\nand therefore the way that natural law is embodied could itself change\nwith time, which was an idea Aquinas later incorporated into his own\nnatural law theory. Aristotle did not write extensively about sexual\nissues, since he was less concerned with the appetites than Plato.\nProbably the best reconstruction of his views places him in mainstream\nGreek society as outlined above; his main concern is with an active\nversus a passive role, with only the latter problematic for those who\neither are or will become citizens. Zeno, the founder of Stoicism,\nwas, according to his contemporaries, only attracted to men, and his\nthought did not have prohibitions against same-sex sexuality. In\ncontrast, Cicero, a later Stoic, was dismissive about sexuality in\ngeneral, with some harsher remarks towards same-sex pursuits (Cicero,\n1966, 407-415).\n\nThe most influential formulation of natural law theory was made by\nThomas Aquinas in the thirteenth century. Integrating an Aristotelian\napproach with Christian theology, Aquinas emphasized the centrality of\ncertain human goods, including marriage and procreation. While Aquinas\ndid not write much about same-sex sexual relations, he did write at\nlength about various sex acts as sins. For Aquinas, sexuality that was\nwithin the bounds of marriage and which helped to further\nwhat he saw as the distinctive goods of marriage, mainly love,\ncompanionship, and legitimate offspring, was permissible, and even\ngood. Aquinas did not argue that procreation was a necessary part of\nmoral or just sex; married couples could enjoy sex without the motive\nof having children, and sex in marriages where one or both partners is\nsterile (perhaps because the woman is postmenopausal) is also\npotentially just (given a motive of expressing love). So far\nAquinas\u2019 view actually need not rule out homosexual sex. For\nexample, a Thomist could embrace same-sex marriage, and then apply the\nsame reasoning, simply seeing the couple as a reproductively sterile,\nyet still fully loving and companionate union.\n\nAquinas, in a significant move, adds a requirement that for any given\nsex act to be moral it must be of a generative kind. The only way that\nthis can be achieved is via vaginal intercourse. That is, since only\nthe emission of semen in a vagina can result in natural reproduction,\nonly sex acts of that type are generative, even if a given sex act\ndoes not lead to reproduction, and even if it is impossible due to\ninfertility. The consequence of this addition is to rule out the\npossibility, of course, that homosexual sex could ever be moral (even\nif done within a loving marriage), in addition to forbidding any\nnon-vaginal sex for opposite-sex married couples. What is the\njustification for this important addition? This question is made all\nthe more pressing in that Aquinas does allow that how broad moral\nrules apply to individuals may vary considerably, since the nature of\npersons also varies to some extent. That is, since Aquinas allows that\nindividual natures vary, one could simply argue that one is, by\nnature, emotionally and physically attracted to persons of one\u2019s\nown gender, and hence to pursue same-sex relationships is\n\u2018natural\u2019 (Sullivan, 1995). Unfortunately, Aquinas does\nnot spell out a justification for this generative requirement.\n\nMore recent natural law theorists, however, have presented a couple of\ndifferent lines of defense for Aquinas\u2019 \u2018generative\ntype\u2019 requirement. The first is that sex acts that involve\neither homosexuality, heterosexual sodomy, or which use contraception,\nfrustrate the purpose of the sex organs, which is reproductive. This\nargument, often called the \u2018perverted faculty argument\u2019,\nis perhaps implicit in Aquinas. It has, however, come in for sharp\nattack (see Weitham, 1997), and the best recent defenders of a\nThomistic natural law approach are attempting to move beyond it (e.g.,\nGeorge, 1999a, dismisses the argument). If their arguments fail, of\ncourse, they must allow that some homosexual sex acts are morally\npermissible (even positively good), although they would still have\nresources with which to argue against casual gay (and straight)\nsex.\n\nAlthough the specifics of the second sort of argument offered by\nvarious contemporary natural law theorists vary, they possess common\nelements(Finnis, 1994; George, 1999a). As Thomists, their argument\nrests largely upon an account of human goods. The two most important\nfor the argument against homosexual sex (though not against\nhomosexuality as an orientation which is not acted upon, and hence in\nthis they follow official Catholic doctrine; see George, 1999a, ch.15)\nare personal integration and marriage. Personal integration, in this\nview, is the idea that humans, as agents, need to have integration\nbetween their intentions as agents and their embodied selves. Thus, to\nuse one\u2019s or another\u2019s body as a mere means to one\u2019s\nown pleasure, as they argue happens with masturbation, causes\n\u2018dis-integration\u2019 of the self. That is, one\u2019s\nintention then is just to use a body (one\u2019s own or\nanother\u2019s) as a mere means to the end of pleasure, and this\ndetracts from personal integration. Yet one could easily reply that\ntwo persons of the same sex engaging in sexual union does not\nnecessarily imply any sort of \u2018use\u2019 of the other as a mere\nmeans to one\u2019s own pleasure. Hence, natural law theorists\nrespond that sexual union in the context of the realization of\nmarriage as an important human good is the only permissible expression\nof sexuality. Yet this argument requires drawing how marriage is an\nimportant good in a very particular way, since it puts procreation at\nthe center of marriage as its \u201cnatural fulfillment\u201d\n(George, 1999a, 168). Natural law theorists, if they want to support\ntheir objection to homosexual sex, have to emphasize procreation. If,\nfor example, they were to place love and mutual support for human\nflourishing at the center, it is clear that many same-sex couples\nwould meet this standard. Hence their sexual acts would be morally\njust.\n\nThere are, however, several objections that are made against this\naccount of marriage as a central human good. One is that by placing\nprocreation as the \u2018natural fulfillment\u2019 of marriage,\nsterile marriages are thereby denigrated. Sex in an opposite-sex\nmarriage where the partners know that one or both of them are sterile\nis not done for procreation. Yet surely it is not wrong. Why, then, is\nhomosexual sex in the same context (a long-term companionate union)\nwrong (Macedo, 1995)? The natural law rejoinder is that while vaginal\nintercourse is a potentially procreative sex act, considered in itself\n(though admitting the possibility that it may be impossible for a\nparticular couple), oral and anal sex acts are never potentially\nprocreative, whether heterosexual or homosexual (George, 1999a). But\nis this biological distinction also morally relevant, and in the\nmanner that natural law theorists assume? Natural law theorists, in\ntheir discussions of these issues, seem to waver. On the one hand,\nthey want to defend an ideal of marriage as a loving union wherein two\npersons are committed to their mutual flourishing, and where sex is a\ncomplement to that ideal. Yet that opens the possibility of\npermissible gay sex, or heterosexual sodomy, both of which they want\nto oppose. So they then defend an account of sexuality which seems\ncrudely reductive, emphasizing procreation to the point where\nliterally a male orgasm anywhere except in the vagina of one\u2019s\nloving spouse is impermissible. Then, when accused of being reductive,\nthey move back to the broader ideal of marriage.\n\nNatural law theory, at present, has made significant concessions to\nmainstream liberal thought. In contrast certainly to its medieval\nformulation, most contemporary natural law theorists argue for limited\ngovernmental power, and do not believe that the state has an interest\nin attempting to prevent all moral wrongdoing. Still, most proponents\nof the \u201cNew Natural Law Theory\u201d do argue against\nhomosexuality, and against legal protections for gays and lesbians in\nterms of employment and housing, even to the point of serving as\nexpert witnesses in court cases or helping in the writing of\namicus curae briefs. They also argue against same sex\nmarriage (Bradley, 2001; George, 1999b). There have been some\nattempts, however, to reconcile natural law theory and homosexuality\n(see, for example, Lago, 2018; Goldstein, 2011). While maintaining the\ncentral aspects of natural law theory and its account of basic human\ngoods, they typically either argue that marriage itself is not a basic\ngood (Lago), or that the sort of good it is, when understood in a less\nnarrow, dogmatic fashion, is such that same-sex couples can enjoy it.\nPart of the theoretical interest in these arguments is that they allow\nfor a moral evaluation of sexuality, still requiring it to realize the\nbasic good of friendship if it is to be permissible, while avoiding\nwhat seem to be the various problematic aspects of contemporary\nnatural law theorists\u2019 denigration of same-sex sexuality in any\nform.\n4. Queer Theory and the Social Construction of Sexuality\n\nWith the rise of the gay liberation movement in the post-Stonewall\nera, overtly gay and lesbian perspectives began to be put forward in\npolitics, philosophy and literary theory. Initially these often were\novertly linked to feminist analyses of patriarchy (e.g., Rich, 1980)\nor other, earlier approaches to theory. Yet in the late 1980s and\nearly 1990s queer theory was developed, although there are obviously\nimportant antecedents which make it difficult to date it precisely.\nThere are a number of ways in which queer theory differed from earlier\ngay liberation theory, but an important initial difference becomes\napparent once we examine the reasons for opting for employing the term\n\u2018queer\u2019 as opposed to \u2018gay and lesbian.\u2019 Some\nversions of, for example, lesbian theory portrayed the essence of\nlesbian identity and sexuality in very specific terms:\nnon-hierarchical, consensual, and, specifically in terms of sexuality,\nas not necessarily focused upon genitalia (e.g., Faderman, 1985).\nLesbians arguing from this framework, for example, could very well\ncriticize natural law theorists as inscribing into the very \u201claw\nof nature\u201d an essentially masculine sexuality, focused upon the\ngenitals, penetration, and the status of the male orgasm (natural law\ntheorists rarely mention female orgasms).\n\nThis approach, based upon characterizations of \u2018lesbian\u2019\nand \u2018gay\u2019 identity and sexuality, however, suffered from\nthree difficulties. First, it appeared even though the goal was to\ncritique a heterosexist regime for its exclusion and marginalization\nof those whose sexuality is different, any specific or\n\u201cessentialist\u201d account of gay or lesbian sexuality had the\nsame effect. Sticking with the example used above, of a specific\nconceptualization of lesbian identity, it denigrates women who are\nsexually and emotionally attracted to other women, yet who do not fit\nthe description. Sado-masochists and butch/fem lesbians arguably do\nnot fit this ideal of \u2018equality\u2019 offered. A second problem\nwas that by placing such an emphasis upon the gender of one\u2019s\nsexual partner(s), other possible important sources of identity are\nmarginalized, such as race and ethnicity. What may be of utmost\nimportance, for example, for a black lesbian is her lesbianism, rather\nthan her race. Many gays and lesbians of color attacked this approach,\naccusing it of re-inscribing an essentially white identity into the\nheart of gay or lesbian identity (Jagose, 1996).\n\nThe third and final problem for the gay liberationist approach was\nthat it often took this category of \u2018identity\u2019 itself as\nunproblematic and unhistorical. Such a view, however, largely because\nof arguments developed within poststructuralism, seemed increasingly\nuntenable. The key figure in the attack upon identity as ahistorical\nis Michel Foucault. In a series of works he set out to analyze the\nhistory of sexuality from ancient Greece to the modern era (1980,\n1985, 1986). Although the project was tragically cut short by his\ndeath in 1984, from complications arising from AIDS, Foucault\narticulated how profoundly understandings of sexuality can vary across\ntime and space, and his arguments have proven very influential in gay\nand lesbian theorizing in general, and queer theory in particular\n(Spargo, 1999; Stychin, 2005).\n\nOne of the reasons for the historical review above is that it helps to\ngive some background for understanding the claim that sexuality is\nsocially constructed, rather than given by nature. Moreover, in order\nto not prejudge the issue of social constructionism versus\nessentialism, I avoided applying the term \u2018homosexual\u2019 to\nthe ancient or medieval eras. In ancient Greece the gender of\none\u2019s partner(s) was not important, but instead whether one took\nthe active or passive role. In the medieval view, a\n\u2018sodomite\u2019 was a person who succumbed to temptation and\nengaged in certain non-procreative sex acts. Although the gender of\nthe partner was more important in the medieval than in the ancient\nview, the broader theological framework placed the emphasis upon a sin\nversus refraining-from-sin dichotomy. With the rise of the notion of\n\u2018homosexuality\u2019 in the modern era, a person is placed into\na specific category even if one does not act upon those inclinations.\nIt is difficult to perceive a common, natural sexuality expressed\nacross these three very different cultures. The social constructionist\ncontention is that there is no \u2018natural\u2019 sexuality; all\nsexual understandings are constructed within and mediated by cultural\nunderstandings. The examples can be pushed much further by\nincorporating anthropological data outside of the Western tradition\n(Halperin, 1990; Greenberg, 1988). Yet even within the narrower\ncontext offered here, the differences between them are striking. The\nassumption in ancient Greece was that men (less is known about Greek\nattitudes towards women) can respond erotically to either sex, and the\nvast majority of men who engaged in same-sex relationships were also\nmarried (or would later become married). Yet the contemporary\nunderstanding of homosexuality divides the sexual domain in two,\nheterosexual and homosexual, and most heterosexuals cannot respond\nerotically to their own sex.\n\nIn saying that sexuality is a social construct, these theorists are\nnot saying that these understandings are not real. Since persons are\nalso constructs of their culture (in this view), we are made into\nthose categories. Hence today persons of course understand themselves\nas straight or gay (or perhaps bisexual), and it is very difficult to\nstep outside of these categories, even once one comes to see them as\nthe historical constructs they are.\n\nGay and lesbian theory was thus faced with three significant problems,\nall of which involved difficulties with the notion of\n\u2018identity.\u2019 Queer theory arose in large part as an attempt\nto overcome them. How queer theory does so can be seen by looking at\nthe term \u2018queer\u2019 itself. In contrast to gay or lesbian,\n\u2018queer,\u2019 it is argued, does not refer to an essence,\nwhether of a sexual nature or not. Instead it is purely relational,\nstanding as an undefined term that gets its meaning precisely by being\nthat which is outside of the norm, however that norm itself may be\ndefined. As one of the most articulate queer theorists puts it:\n\u201cQueer is \u2026 whatever is at odds with the normal,\nthe legitimate, the dominant. There is nothing in particular to\nwhich it necessarily refers. It is an identity without an\nessence\u201d (Halperin, 1995, 62, original emphasis). By lacking any\nessence, queer does not marginalize those whose sexuality is outside\nof any gay or lesbian norm, such as sado-masochists. Since specific\nconceptualizations of sexuality are avoided, and hence not put at the\ncenter of any definition of queer, it allows more freedom for\nself-identification for, say, black lesbians to identify as much or\nmore with their race (or any other trait, such as involvement in an S\n& M subculture) than with lesbianism. Finally, it incorporates the\ninsights of poststructuralism about the difficulties in ascribing any\nessence or non-historical aspect to identity.\n\nThis central move by queer theorists, the claim that the categories\nthrough which identity is understood are all social constructs rather\nthan given to us by nature, opens up a number of analytical\npossibilities. For example, queer theorists examine how fundamental\nnotions of gender and sex which seem so natural and self-evident to\npersons in the modern West are in fact constructed and reinforced\nthrough everyday actions, and that this occurs in ways that privilege\nheterosexuality (Butler, 1990, 1993). Also examined are medical\ncategories, such as \u2018inverts\u2019 and intersexuality, which\nare themselves socially constructed (Fausto-Sterling, 2000, is an\nerudite example of this, although she is not ultimately a queer\ntheorist). Others examine how language and especially divisions\nbetween what is said and what is not said, corresponding to the\ndichotomy between \u2018closeted\u2019 and \u2018out,\u2019\nespecially in regards to the modern division of\nheterosexual/homosexual, structure much of modern thought. That is, it\nis argued that when we look at dichotomies such as natural/artificial,\nor masculine/feminine, we find in the background an implicit reliance\nupon a very recent, and arbitrary, understanding of the sexual world\nas split into two species (Sedgwick, 1990). The fluidity of categories\ncreated through queer theory even opens the possibility of new sorts\nof histories that examine previously silent types of affections and\nrelationships (Carter, 2005).\n\nAnother critical perspective opened up by a queer approach, although\ncertainly implicit in those just referred to, is especially important.\nSince most anti-gay and lesbian arguments rely upon the alleged\nnaturalness of heterosexuality, queer theorists attempt to show how\nthese categories are themselves deeply social constructs. An example\nhelps to illustrate the approach. In an essay against gay marriage,\nchosen because it is very representative, James Q. Wilson (1996)\ncontends that gay men have a \u201cgreat tendency\u201d to be\npromiscuous. In contrast, he puts forward loving, monogamous marriage\nas the natural condition of heterosexuality. Heterosexuality, in his\nargument, is an odd combination of something completely natural yet\nsimultaneously endangered. One is born straight, yet this natural\ncondition can be subverted by such things as the presence of gay\ncouples, gay teachers, or even excessive talk about homosexuality.\nWilson\u2019s argument requires a radical disjunction between\nheterosexuality and homosexuality. If gayness is radically different,\nit is legitimate to suppress it. Wilson has the courage to be\nforthright about this element of his argument; he comes out against\n\u201cthe political imposition of tolerance\u201d towards gays and\nlesbians (Wilson, 1996, 35).\n\nIt is a common move in queer theory to bracket, at least temporarily,\nissues of truth and falsity (Halperin, 1995). Instead, the analysis\nfocuses on the social function of discourse. Questions of who counts\nas an expert and why, and concerns about the effects of the\nexpert\u2019s discourse are given equal status to questions of the\nverity of what is said. This approach reveals that hidden underneath\nWilson\u2019s (and other anti-gay) work is an important\nepistemological move. Since heterosexuality is the natural condition,\nit is a place that is spoken from but not inquired into. In contrast,\nhomosexuality is the aberration and hence it needs to be studied but\nit is not an authoritative place from which one can speak. By virtue\nof this heterosexual privilege, Wilson is allowed the voice of the\nimpartial, fair-minded expert. Yet, as the history section above\nshows, there are striking discontinuities in understandings of\nsexuality, and this is true to the point that, according to queer\ntheorists, we should not think of sexuality as having any particular\nnature at all. Through undoing our infatuation with any specific\nconception of sexuality, the queer theorist opens space for\nmarginalized forms of sexuality, and thus of ways of being more\ngenerally.\n\nThe insistence that we must investigate the ways in which categories\nsuch as sexuality and orientation are created and given power through\nscience and other cultural mechanisms has made queer theory appealing\nto scholars in a variety of disciplines. Historians and sociologists\nhave drawn on it, which is perhaps unsurprising given the role of\nhistorical claims about the social construction of sexuality. Queer\ntheory has been especially influential in literary studies and\nfeminist theory, even though the dividing lines between the latter and\nqueer thinking is contested (see Jagose, 2009; Marinucci, 2010). One\nof the most prominent scholars working in the area of gay and lesbian\nissues in constitutional law has also drawn on queer theory to advance\nhis interrogation of the ways that US law privileges heterosexuality\n(Eskridge, 1999). Scholars in postcolonial and racial analyses,\nethnography, American studies, and other fields have drawn on the\nconceptual tools provided by queer theory.\n\nDespite its roots in postmodernism and Foucault\u2019s work in\nparticular, queer theory\u2019s reception in France was initially\nhostile (see Eribon, 2004). The core texts from the first\n\u2018wave\u2019 of queer theory, such as Judith Butler\u2019s and\nEve Sedgwick\u2019s central works, were slow to appear in French\ntranslation, not coming out until a decade and a half after their\noriginal publication. Doubtless the French republican\nself-understanding, which is universalist and often hostile to\nmovements that are multicultural in their bent, was a factor in the\nslow and often strenuously resisted importation of queer theoretical\ninsights. Similarly, queer theory has also been on the margins in\nGerman philosophy and political philosophy. In sum, it is fair to say\nthat queer theory has had a greater impact in the Anglo-American\nworld.\n\nQueer theory, however, has been criticized in a myriad of ways\n(Jagose, 1996). One set of criticisms comes from theorists who are\nsympathetic to gay liberation conceived as a project of radical social\nchange. An initial criticism is that precisely because\n\u2018queer\u2019 does not refer to any specific sexual status or\ngender object choice, for example Halperin (1995) allows that straight\npersons may be \u2018queer,\u2019 it robs gays and lesbians of the\ndistinctiveness of what makes them marginal. It desexualizes identity,\nwhen the issue is precisely about a sexual identity (Jagose, 1996). A\nrelated criticism is that queer theory, since it refuses any essence\nor reference to standard ideas of normality, cannot make crucial\ndistinctions. For example, queer theorists usually argue that one of\nthe advantages of the term \u2018queer\u2019 is that it thereby\nincludes transsexuals, sado-masochists, and other marginalized\nsexualities. How far does this extend? Is transgenerational sex (e.g.,\npedophilia) permissible? Are there any limits upon the forms of\nacceptable sado-masochism or fetishism? While some queer theorists\nspecifically disallow pedophilia, it is an open question whether the\ntheory has the resources to support such a distinction. Furthermore,\nsome queer theorists overtly refuse to rule out pedophiles as\n\u2018queer\u2019 (Halperin, 1995, 62) Another criticism is that\nqueer theory, in part because it typically has recourse to a very\ntechnical jargon, is written by a narrow elite for that narrow elite.\nIt is therefore class biased and also, in practice, only really\nreferred to at universities and colleges (Malinowitz, 1993).\n\nQueer theory is also criticized by those who reject the desirability\nof radical social change. For example, centrist and conservative gays\nand lesbians have criticized a queer approach by arguing that it will\nbe \u201cdisastrously counter-productive\u201d (Bawer, 1996, xii).\nIf \u2018queer\u2019 keeps its connotation of something perverse and\nat odds with mainstream society, which is precisely what most queer\ntheorists want, it would seem to only validate the attacks upon gays\nand lesbians made by conservatives. Sullivan (1996) also criticizes\nqueer theorists for relying upon Foucault\u2019s account of power,\nwhich he argues does not allow for meaningful resistance. It seems\nlikely, however, that Sullivan\u2019s understanding of\nFoucault\u2019s notions of power and resistance is misguided.\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe debates about homosexuality, in part because they often involve\npublic policy and legal issues, tend to be sharply polarized. Those\nmost concerned with homosexuality, positively or negatively, are also\nthose most engaged, with natural law theorists arguing for gays and\nlesbians having a reduced legal status, and queer theorists engaged in\ncritique and deconstruction of what they see as a heterosexist regime.\nYet the two do not talk much to one another, but rather ignore or talk\npast one another. There are some theorists in the middle. For example,\nMichael Sandel takes an Aristotelian approach from which he argues\nthat gay and lesbian relationships can realize the same goods that\nheterosexual relationships do (Sandel, 1995). He largely shares the\naccount of important human goods that natural law theorists have, yet\nin his evaluation of the worth of same-sex relationships, he is\nclearly sympathetic to gay and lesbian concerns. Similarly, Bruce\nBawer (1993) and Andrew Sullivan (1995) have written eloquent defenses\nof full legal equality for gays and lesbians, including marriage\nrights. Yet neither argue for any systematic reform of broader\nAmerican culture or politics. In this they are essentially\nconservative. Therefore, rather unsurprisingly, these centrists are\nattacked from both sides. Sullivan, for example, has been criticized\nat length both by queer theorists (e.g., Phelan, 2001) and natural law\ntheorists (e.g., George, 1999a).\n\nYet as the foregoing also clearly shows, the policy and legal debates\nsurrounding homosexuality involve fundamental issues of morality and\njustice. Perhaps most centrally of all, they cut to issues of personal\nidentity and self-definition. Hence there is another, and even deeper,\nset of reasons for the polarization that marks these debates.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Alderson, David, 2016, <em>Sex, Needs &amp; Queer Culture: From\nliberation to the Postgay</em>, London: Zed Books.", "Bawer, Bruce, 1993, <em>A Place at the Table: The Gay Individual\nin American Society</em>, New York: Poseidon Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1996. <em>Beyond Queer: Challenging Gay\nLeft Orthodoxy</em>, New York: The Free Press.", "Berman, Paul, 1993, \u201cDemocracy and Homosexuality\u201d in\n<em>The New Republic</em>, 209(25): 17\u201335.", "Boswell, John, 1980, <em>Christianity, Social Tolerance, and\nHomosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the\nChristian Era to the Fourteenth Century</em>, Chicago: The University\nof Chicago Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1994, <em>Same-Sex Unions in Premodern\nEurope</em>, New York: Vintage Books.", "Bradley, Gerard V., 2001, \u201cThe End of Marriage,\u201d in\n<em>Marriage and the Common Good</em>, Kenneth D.
