    "main_text": "Contours of Pure Land Buddhist Thought || Critical Self-Reflection\n2.1 Critical Self-Reflection\n\nMahayana tradition appears to have arisen when, around the beginning\nof the common era, groups of Buddhists emerged who, reflecting on\ntheir own experience in practice, assumed a critical stance toward the\nimmediately preceding tradition. They viewed the existing institutions\nas having declined, during five centuries of transmission since the\ntime of the Buddha, into monastic formalism and scholasticism,\nsectarian disputation, and an erroneous notion of the nature of the\nwisdom that was the aim of Buddhist practice. They declared that the\nestablished view of training, directed to merely personal emancipation\nfrom painful existence, was narrow and finally inadequate, and that in\ntheir aspiration to attain the actual realization \u015a\u0101kyamuni\nhad transmitted, they had sought and discovered a method by which\ngenuine attainment was possible. They called this new path the\n\u201cgreat vehicle\u201d (Mahayana), because it holds as its goal\nthe attainment of authentic enlightenment by all beings, and asserted\nthat it was superior to the existing institutions, which they labeled\nthe \u201clesser vehicle\u201d (Hinayana).\n\nAccording to Mahayanists, the Hinayana sages withdrew from ordinary\nlife in society and performed practices and disciplines, seeking their\nown extinction of passions and emancipation from samsaric existence by\nrealizing the nonsubstantiality of their own person\u2014the fact\nthat the ego-self is no more than a delusional construct. Mahayana\nBuddhists asserted that such praxis did not free practitioners from a\nfinal residue of self-attachment manifested in the desertion of the\nbeings of samsara in favor of personal liberation and in an attachment\nto the goal of nirvana itself. Instead, the Mahayanists taught the\nthorough relinquishment of all attachments through the realization or\n\u201cseeing\u201d of the nonsubstantiality or emptiness that\npervades not only the self, but all things and all persons. Such\nseeing is established by eradicating the discriminative thinking\narising from the perspective of the reified, delusional self. One thus\ntranscends even the dichotomies of self and other, blind passions and\nenlightenment, and samsara and nirvana, and realizes nondiscriminative\nwisdom that \u201csees suchness\u201d or things just as they are.\nHere, practice to attain enlightenment oneself and to liberate all\nbeings is understood to be one.\n\nThe rigorous scrutiny of even religious praxis for vestiges of\nself-attachment and discriminative thinking, which informed the\norigins of the Mahayana movement, also provided impetus for its\ndevelopment as the Pure Land path.\n",
