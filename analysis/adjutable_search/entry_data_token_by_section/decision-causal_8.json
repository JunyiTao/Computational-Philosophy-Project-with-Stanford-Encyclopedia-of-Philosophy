    "main_text": "Current Issues || Probability and Utility\n3.1 Probability and Utility\n\nPrinciples of causal decision theory use probabilities and utilities.\nThe interpretation of probabilities and utilities is a matter of\ndebate. One tradition defines them in terms of functions that\nrepresentation theorems introduce to depict preferences. The\nrepresentation theorems show that if preferences meet certain\nstructural axioms, then if they also meet certain normative axioms,\nthey are as if they follow expected utility. That is, preferences\nfollow expected utility calculated using probability and utility\nfunctions constructed so that preferences follow expected utility.\nExpected utility calculated this way differs from expected utility\ncalculated using probability and utility assignments grounded in\nattitudes toward possible outcomes. For example, a person confused\nabout bets concerning a coin toss may have preferences among those\nbets that are as if he assigns probability 60% to heads, when, in\nfact, the evidence of past tosses leads him to assign probability 40%\nto heads. Consequently, when preferences meet a representation\ntheorem\u2019s structural axioms, the theorem\u2019s normative\naxioms justify only conformity with expected utility fabricated to\nagree with preferences and do not justify conformity with expected\nutility in the traditional sense. Defining probability and utility\nusing the representation theorems thus weakens the traditional\nprinciple of expected utility. It becomes merely a principle of\ncoherence among preferences.\n\nInstead of using the representation theorems to define probabilities\nand utilities, decision theory may use them to establish\nprobabilities\u2019 and utilities\u2019 measurability when\npreferences meet structural and normative axioms. This employment of\nthe representation theorems allows decision theory to advance the\ntraditional principle of expected utility and thereby enrich its\ntreatment of rational decisions. Decision theory may justify that\ntraditional principle by deriving it from general principles of\nevaluation, as in Weirich (2001).\n\nA broad account of probabilities and utilities takes them to indicate\nattitudes toward propositions. They are rational degrees of belief and\nrational degrees of desire, respectively. This account of\nprobabilities and utilities recognizes their existence in cases where\nthey are not inferable from preferences or their other effects but\ninstead are inferable from their causes, such as an agent\u2019s\ninformation about objective probabilities, or are not inferable at all\n(except perhaps by introspection). The account relies on arguments\nthat degrees of belief and degrees of desire, if rational, conform to\nstandard principles of probability and utility. Bolstering these\narguments is work for causal decision theory.\n\nBesides clarifying its general interpretation of probability and\nutility, causal decision theory searches for the particular\nprobabilities and utilities that yield the best version of its\nprinciple to maximize expected utility. The causal probabilities in\nits formula for expected utility may be probabilities of subjunctive\nconditionals or various substitutes. Versions that use probabilities\nof subjunctive conditionals must settle on an analysis of those\nconditionals. Lewis (1973: Chap. 1) modifies Stalnaker\u2019s\nanalysis to count a subjunctive conditional true if and only if as\nantecedent worlds come closer and closer to the actual world, there is\na point beyond which the consequent is true in all the worlds at least\nthat close. Joyce (1999: 161\u2013180) advances probability images,\nas Lewis (1976) introduces them, as substitutes for probabilities of\nsubjunctive conditionals. The probability image of a state \\(S\\) under\nsubjunctive supposition of an act \\(A\\) is the probability of \\(S\\)\naccording to an assignment that shifts the probability of\n\\({\\sim}A\\)-worlds to nearby \\(A\\)-worlds. Causal relations among an\nact and possible states guide probability\u2019s reassignment.\nA common formula for an act\u2019s expected utility takes the\nutility for an act-state pair, the utility of the act\u2019s outcome\nin the state, to be the utility of the act\u2019s and the\nstate\u2019s conjunction:\n\n\\[\n\\textit{EU} (A) = \\sum_i P(A \\gt S_i)\\util (A \\amp S_i).\n\\] \n\n\nDoes causal decision theory need an alternative, more\ncausally-sensitive utility for an act-state pair?  Weirich (1980)\nargues that it does. A person contemplating a wager that the capital\nof Missouri is Jefferson City entertains the consequences if\nhe were to make the wager given that St. Louis is\nMissouri\u2019s capital. A rational deliberator subjunctively\nsupposes an act attending to causal relations and indicatively\nsupposes a state attending to evidential relations, but can suppose an\nact\u2019s and a state\u2019s conjunction only one way. Furthermore,\nusing the utility of an act\u2019s and a state\u2019s conjunction\nprevents an act\u2019s expected utility from being\npartition-invariant. The next subsection elaborates this point.\n",
