    "main_text": "Theories of Desire\n1. Theories of Desire\n\n\nThere is a simple, conservative theory of desire according to which\nhaving a desire is a matter of having dispositions to act. According to\nthis theory, dispositions to act are the only essential feature of\ndesires; the tendencies a person has to feel certain ways or think in\ncertain ways when she has a desire are interesting but inessential\ntendencies. If Nora desires tea, this is because she is disposed to get\nherself some tea, and her dispositions to feel good about tea, think\npositively about getting tea, or to keep having her thoughts turn\ntoward getting tea are merely associated effects of her desire. The\nsimple, conservative theory has a number of competitors, each\nemphasizing something different from, or in addition to, dispositions\nto action.\n\n\nIn spite of the variety of theoretical options, the simple,\nconservative theory of desire\u2014the action-based theory\u2014is\nthe most widely-held theory, making it the appropriate place to begin\nany discussion.\n",
