    "main_text": "Critique of Aristotelianism\n2. Critique of Aristotelianism\n\n\nGiven that his earliest development of an interest in logic and\nphilosophy occurred at the University of Padua, it is surely no\nsurprise that a close familiarity with the works of Aristotle and his\ninterpreters would form a major part of his training. It is perhaps\nworth stressing that in philosophy as in other areas such as art,\narchitecture, science and literature, the Renaissance was a\n\u201cretrospective\u201d age. From roughly the mid-Fourteenth\nthrough the late Sixteenth centuries, many of the leading scholars of\nEurope were engaged in attempting to recover the high levels of skills\nand learning that characterized late classical antiquity. \nHumanists trained in the ancient languages sought to recover texts\nwhich had been lost or ignored for a millennium or more. We owe the\nvery concept of the \u201cMiddle Ages\u201d (not to mention the more\npejorative notion of the \u201cdark ages\u201d) to this\nmovement. Patrizi's early mastery of Greek and his interest in\nassembling a library of classical Greek manuscripts (Muccillo 1993)\nplaces him well within the tradition of seeking to restore the legacy\nof antiquity as a precondition for moving ahead to a \u201cnew\u201d\nera.\n\n\nAristotle's works had, of course, been made available to\nscholars via translation from Greek and Arabic sources during the\nmedieval period (Twelfth through Fourteenth centuries), and a\nfamiliarity with Aristotle's logic and natural philosophy became\na requirement for an Arts degree at medieval universities and thus an\nintegral part of the training of those who wished to pursue advanced\nstudies in medicine, theology or canon or civil law. But the number of\nphilosophers or theologians who could access the Aristotelian\ncorpus in the original Greek was quite small, and there was\nan extensive body of works in Greek devoted to commentaries and\ncriticisms of the Stagirite's positions that would not become\navailable to a majority of readers until the Renaissance provided\naccessible translations. It is not surprising that Patrizi devoted\nmuch of his time and effort to these endeavors, and his doing so would\nhave a profound effect on the way in which he and many of his\ncontemporaries and successors would come to interpret the Peripatetic\nsystem.\n\n\nIt is perhaps significant that Patrizi's earliest works,\nproduced while he was still in close contact with teachers and\ncolleagues at Padua, reveal a far less critical view of Aristotle and\nhis doctrines than his later writings would, generally attempting to\nutilize Plato and other earlier thinkers to complement rather than\nrefute Peripatetic positions (see the article by F. Bottin in the\nOther Internet Resources).  In this regard, it is quite likely that\nPatrizi may be said to have undergone a philosophical development from\nan earlier, more sympathetic, view of Aristotle's philosophy to\na more critical attitude as his familiarity with Platonic and other\nearlier sources increased and he became aware of the debates among the\ncontemporary Aristotelians themselves, such as Pietro Pomponazzi and\nAgostino Nifo, over such basic doctrines as the immortality of the\nsoul and the nature of the physical cosmos. Add to this the ongoing\nexchanges he had with thinkers committed to developing a philosophical\nand scientific method outside both the Platonic and Aristotelian\n\u201cmainstreams\u201d and it becomes clear why Patrizi came to\nplay the major role he did in the move from an entrenched Peripatetic\napproach to the search for a \u201cnew\u201d method which would come\nto characterize the leading philosophers and scientists of the\nSeventeenth Century and beyond.\n\n\nBeginning with the first edition of his Discussiones\nperipateticae in 1571, Patrizi initiated a more critical\nassessment of the character and philosophical reasoning of Aristotle\nthan had characterized his earlier writings. That work, followed\nby the expanded edition of 1581, provided a close comparison of the\nviews of Aristotle and Plato on a wide range of philosophical issues,\narguing that Plato's views were preferable on all counts\n(Kristeller 1964, 115), although it should be noted that the three\nbooks added to the 1581 edition exhibit a far more aggressive tone than\nthe initial edition. In addition, Patrizi echoes the theme put\nforward earlier by Christian Platonists such as Augustine,\nPseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, and his own Renaissance predecessor\nMarsilio Ficino, that Platonism is more in harmony with Church doctrine\nthan the Stagirite's were. Later, by including the spurious\nwork Theology of Aristotle, derived largely from the\nNeoplatonist Plotinus, as an appendix to his Nova de universis\nphilosophia (1591), he implied that Aristotle in fact agreed with\nmany of the Platonic doctrines he openly attacked in his\ncorpus of attributed works, thus suggesting an underlying\nduplicity on Aristotle's part in order to bolster his own\nphilosophic credentials as an independent thinker. And\nPatrizi's own \u201cnovel\u201d philosophical system would\nunderscore the anti-Aristotelian attitude he had expressed throughout\nhis career.\n\n\nWhat were some of the major issues on which Patrizi took Aristotle\nto task?   In his Della poetica (Aguzzi-Barbagli\n1961-1971) he evaluated and rejected the Stagirite's analysis of\npoetry as a form of imitation, seeking to replace it with his own view,\ninfluenced at least in part by Platonic sources (Bolzoni 1980, 1983;\nSpedicati 1986). With regard to Aristotle's views on\nmetaphysics and natural philosophy, he rejected the notion that the\nthree basic \u201cprinciples\u201d of form, matter and privation\ncould provide an adequate account of the nature of being, especially\ngiven that matter was conceived in terms of pure potentiality and form\nas incapable of existing except as embodied in a material substrate\n(Vasoli 1996). Within the broader range of scientific and\ncosmological issues discussed in his major work on his\n\u201cNew\u201d philosophy, Patrizi rejects Aristotle's denial\nof the possibility of a vacuum, arguing instead for a position closer\nto the atomistic view that a material void is possible, although\ncouched in terms of his own conception of space. In that work he\nwould also argue for replacing the four standard Aristotelian material\nelements \u2013 earth, air, fire and water \u2013 with his own\nalternatives \u2013 space (spatium), light (lux),\nheat (calor) and humidity (fluor). He rejected\nthe finitude of the physical universe and the concept that heavenly\nbodies moved in conjunction with fixed celestial spheres. In sum,\nby drawing upon a series of ancient, late medieval and Renaissance\nsources, Patrizi sought to replace the dominant Aristotelianism of his\nera with a new and challenging alternative \u2013 one which showed at\nmany levels his preference for a Platonic conception of reality.\n",
