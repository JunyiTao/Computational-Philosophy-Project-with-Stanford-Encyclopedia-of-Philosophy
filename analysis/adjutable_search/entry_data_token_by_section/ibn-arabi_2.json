    "main_text": "Methodology || Divine Speech\n2.1 Divine Speech\n\nIt is difficult to overestimate the importance of the Koran as Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s source of inspiration (Chodkiewicz 1993a).\nFar more than either the theologians or the philosophers, he dedicated\nhis efforts to absorbing God\u2019s word and being absorbed by it,\nand his writings are suffused with quotations and terminology from the\ntext. As the divine speech (kal\u00e2m), the Koran is\nunderstood as nonmanifest and indistinct from the Divine Essence,\nthough it becomes manifest in recitation and writing. God\u2019s\nspeech reveals itself not only in scripture, but also in the universe\nand the soul. The homologies among cosmos, soul, and scripture follow\neasily on the Koran\u2019s imagery. In several verses it speaks of\nGod\u2019s creative act as his command \u201cBe!\u201d, and it\nalludes to the individual creatures as his words\n(kalim\u00e2t). The identity of speech and creativity is\nalso seen in the Koran\u2019s frequent use of the term\n\u201csign\u201d (\u00e2ya) to designate the phenomena of\nthe universe, the interior events of the soul, and its own verses. In\neffect, when God speaks\u2014and he speaks because the Infinite Real\ncannot but display its qualities and characteristics\u2014he voices\nthree books, each of which is made up of signs/verses. As Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee says of the cosmos, \u201cIt is all letters,\nwords, chapters, and verses, so it is the Great Koran\u201d (Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee, al-Fut\u00fbh\u00e2t, 1911 edition,\n4:167.22).\n\nIn one of his best known explications of the nature of things, Ibn\nal-\u2018Arab\u00ee looks at God\u2019s creativity as an analogue\nof human speech. Just as we create words and sentences in the\nsubstratum of breath, so God creates the universe by articulating\nwords in the Breath of the All-Merciful (nafas\nal-rahm\u00e2n), which is the deployment of existence\n(inbis\u00e2t al-wuj\u00fbd); indeed, existence itself is\nsynonymous with mercy (rahma). His most elaborate\ncosmological scheme (among several) depicts the basic levels of cosmic\ndeployment as corresponding with the twenty-eight letters of the\nArabic alphabet, each representing a specific modality of articulated\nexistence (Burckhardt 1977, Chittick 1998).\n\nThe pivotal importance of the written Koran rests on the fact that it\nvoices the divine names and the signs/verses in human language,\nthereby providing the key to deciphering the other two books. By\ninterpreting the Koran, we also interpret the cosmos and ourselves.\nIbn \u2018Arab\u00ee typically begins any discussion with a verse or\ntwo, and he then proceeds to draw out meanings that have a bearing on\nwhatever the context may be. He insists that readings must conform to\nthe Arabic language as spoken by the original recipients of the Book,\nbut more often than not he offers surprising and highly original\ninterpretations. On close examination, these are seen to be consistent\nwith the language, even when they fly in the face of common sense. It\nis precisely his ability to stick to the transmitted sources and\nsimultaneously bring out new meanings\u2014which, once expressed,\nseem almost self-evident\u2014that has convinced the later tradition\nof his exceptional mastery. He tells us that the author of the Koran\nintends every meaning understood by every reader, and he reminds us\nthat human authors cannot have the same intention. Moreover, he tells\nus that if someone re-reads a Koranic verse and sees exactly the same\nmeaning that he saw the previous time, he has not read it\n\u201cproperly\u201d\u2014that is, in keeping with the\nhaqq of the divine speech\u2014for the meanings disclosed in\nthe Three Books are never repeated.\n\nGod\u2019s words, like our own spoken words, dissipate quickly, so he\nrenews them constantly, \u201cat every breath\u201d (ma\u2018\nal-anf\u00e2s). This is to say that \u201ceverything other than\nGod\u201d (the standard definition of the cosmos) is re-created at\neach instant (tajd\u00eed al-khalq\nfi\u2019l-\u00e2n\u00e2t) and all things undergo constant\nchange. The notion that \u201cThere is no repetition in [God\u2019s]\nself-disclosure\u201d (l\u00e2 takr\u00e2r\nfi\u2019l-tajall\u00ee) is a basic principle of Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s thought. He sees it as a straightforward\napplication of tawh\u00eed. By acknowledging the unity of\nthe Real, we recognize that it is one and unique in its every act,\nwhich means that each created thing and each moment of each thing is\none and unique; nothing can ever be repeated precisely because of each\nthing\u2019s uniqueness and the divine infinity.\n",
