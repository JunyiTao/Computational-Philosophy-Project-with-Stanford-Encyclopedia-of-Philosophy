    "main_text": "Belief bases || Increased expressive power\n5.1 Increased expressive power\n\nIn the approaches discussed above, all beliefs in the belief set are\ntreated equally in the sense that they are all taken seriously as\nbeliefs in their own right. However, due to logical closure the belief\nset contains many elements that are not really worth to be taken\nseriously. Hence, suppose that the belief set contains the sentence\n\\(p\\), \u201cShakespeare wrote Hamlet\u201d. Due to logical closure\nit then also contains the sentence \\(p \\vee q\\), \u201cEither\nShakespeare wrote Hamlet or Charles Dickens wrote Hamlet\u201d. The\nlatter sentence is a \u201cmere logical consequence\u201d that\nshould have no standing of its own.\n\nBelief bases have been introduced to capture this feature of the\nstructure of human beliefs. A belief base is a set of sentences that\nis not (except as a limiting case) closed under logical consequence.\nIts elements represent beliefs that are held independently of any\nother belief or set of beliefs. Those elements of the belief set that\nare not in the belief base are \u201cmerely derived\u201d, i.e.,\nthey have no independent standing. In this way, models employing\nbelief bases can be said to achieve a somewhat higher degree of\naffinity to natural-language doxastic reasoning than what seems to be\nachievable in models such as AGM that use belief sets as\nrepresentations of belief sets. (A still higher degree of affinity to\nnatural language can be obtained in models employing hyperintensional\nlogic; see Berto 2019.)\n\nIn belief base models, changes are performed on the belief base, which\nis not logically closed. The underlying intuition is that the merely\nderived beliefs are not worth retaining for their own sake. If one of\nthem loses the support that it had in basic beliefs, then it will be\nautomatically discarded.\n\nFor every belief base \\(A\\), there is a belief set \\(\\Cn(A)\\) that\nrepresents the beliefs held according to \\(A\\). On the other hand, one\nand the same belief set can be represented by different belief bases.\nIn this sense, belief bases have more expressive power than belief\nsets. As an example, the two belief bases \\(\\{p, q\\}\\) and \\(\\{p, p\n\\leftrightarrow q\\}\\) have the same logical closure. They are\ntherefore statically equivalent, in the sense of representing\nthe same beliefs. On the other hand, the following example shows that\nthey are not dynamically equivalent in the sense of behaving\nin the same way under operations of change. They can be taken to\nrepresent different ways of holding the same beliefs.\n\n\nLet \\(p\\) denote that the Liberal Party will support the proposal to\nsubsidize the steel industry, and let \\(q\\) denote that Ms. Smith, who\nis a liberal MP, will vote in favour of that proposal.\n\nAbe has the basic beliefs \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), whereas Bob has the basic\nbeliefs \\(p\\) and \\(p \\leftrightarrow q.\\) Thus, their beliefs (on the\nbelief set level) with respect to \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are the same.\n\nBoth Abe and Bob receive and accept the information that \\(p\\) is\nwrong, and they both revise their belief states to include the new\nbelief that \\(\\neg p\\). After that, Abe has the basic beliefs \\(\\neg\np\\) and \\(q\\), whereas Bob has the basic beliefs \\(\\neg p\\) and \\(p\n\\leftrightarrow q\\). Now, their belief sets are no longer the same.\nAbe believes that \\(q\\) whereas Bob believes that \\(\\neg q\\).\n\n\n(In belief set models, cases like these are taken care of by assuming\nthat although Abe\u2019s and Bob\u2019s belief states are\nrepresented by the same belief set, this belief set is associated with\ndifferent selection mechanisms in the two cases. Abe has a selection\nmechanism that gives priority to \\(q\\) over \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\),\nwhereas Bob\u2019s selection mechanism has the opposite\npriorities.)\n\nThere is only one inconsistent belief set (logically closed\ninconsistent set), namely the whole language. On the other hand there\nare, in any non-trivial logic, many different inconsistent belief\nbases. Therefore, belief bases make it possible to distinguish between\ndifferent inconsistent belief states.\n\nIn belief revision theory it has mostly been taken for granted that\nbelief sets correspond to a coherentist epistemology, whereas belief\nbases represent foundationalism. However, the logical relationships\namong the elements of a logically closed set do not adequately\nrepresent epistemic coherence. Although coherentists typically claim\nthat all beliefs contribute to the justification of other\nbeliefs, they hardly mean this to apply to merely derived beliefs such\nas \u201ceither Paris or Rome is the capital of France\u201d, that\none believes only because one believes Paris to be the capital of\nFrance. Therefore, the distinction between operations on belief bases\nand operations on belief sets should not be equated with that between\nfoundationalism and coherentism.\n",
