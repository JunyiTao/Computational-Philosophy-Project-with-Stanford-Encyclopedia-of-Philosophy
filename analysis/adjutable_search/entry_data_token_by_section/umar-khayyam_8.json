The Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t (Quatrains)\n\nHere with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough,\nA Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse\u2014and Thou\nBeside me singing in the Wilderness\u2014\nAnd Wilderness is Paradise enow.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t, FitzGerald 1859, 30; 2009, 21)\n\nAlthough Umar Khayyam\u2019s Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t have been admired in the Persian speaking world for many centuries, they have only been known in the West widely since the mid 19th century, when Edward FitzGerald rendered the Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t into English.\nThe word Ruba\u2018\u012b (plural: Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t), meaning \u201cquatrain,\u201d comes from the word al-R\u0101bi\u2018, the number four in Arabic. It refers to a poetic form which consists of a four-lined stanza and two hemistiches for a total of four parts. Tar\u0101nah (snatch) and doba\u012bt\u012b (two-liner) are very similar to quatrains; they differ from each other in terms of rhyme scheme and themes or message. They all have a short and simple form that provides a type of \u201cpoetic punch line.\u201d\nThe overwhelming majority of the literary works on the Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t have been devoted to the monumental task of determining the authentic Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t from the inauthentic ones. In our current discussion, we shall bypass that controversy and rely on the most authoritative Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t in order to provide a commentary on Khayyam\u2019s critique of the fundamental tenets of organized religion(s). The salient features of his critique address the following:\n\nImpermanence and the quest for the meaning of life\nTheodicy\nThe here and now\nEpistemology\nEschatology\nDeterminism and free will\nPhilosophical wisdom\n\n",
