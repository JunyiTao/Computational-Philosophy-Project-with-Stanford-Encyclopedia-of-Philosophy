    "main_text": "Gestalt Qualities\n2. Gestalt Qualities\n\u201cGestalt\u201d is probably the best known\ncontribution of Ehrenfels to philosophy and psychology. As Ehrenfels\nhimself points out in his 1890 article \u201c\u00dcber\n\u2018Gestaltqualit\u00e4ten\u2019\u201d (\u201cOn \u2018Gestalt Qualities\u2019\u201d), he was inspired by a series of\nremarks in Ernst Mach\u2019s 1886 book\nBeitr\u00e4ge zur Analyse der Empfindungen (Contributions to\nthe Analysis of Sensations), in particular Mach\u2019s claim that\nwe would be able to sense spatial shapes and melodies (\u201ctone\nshapes\u201d) directly. Mach begins by discussing the comparison of\ngeometrical shapes: \u201cIn examining two figures which are alike\n[gleiche Gestalten] but differently colored (for example, two\nletters of the same size and shape, but of different colors), we\nrecognize their sameness of form [gleiche Form] at the first\nglance, in spite of the difference of color-sensation.\u201d (Mach\n1886, 43, translation from Mach 1914, 105, the same example can be\nfound already in Stumpf 1883, 115, which Ehrenfels had read\npreviously.)  However, Mach then also proceeds to apply the\nterm Gestalt in a metaphorical sense to the qualitative moments\nof melodies.\nGestalten, for Mach, appear thanks to an equality\n(Gleichheit) in the sensations, which can be noticed \u201cat\na glance\u201d, i.e., they are given directly, not deduced or\nabstracted. Mach argues that the geometrical similarity of two whole\nfigures would be given by the lower level equality of their elements\n(lengths, angles, etc.) (Mach 1886, 47; Mach 1914, 109). In analogy to\nhis considerations about space, Mach also applies this analysis to\ntime, finding the same \u201cimmediate\u201d perception of\nGestalt in rhythm and melody (Mach 1886, 128; Mach 1914, 285).\nIn this way, Mach used the term Gestalt to indicate the\ncharacteristics of a whole that depend on the specific configuration of\nits parts. This formed one of the starting points for Ehrenfels\u2019\nmuch more focused discussions of Gestalten in 1890. The other\nstarting point is of course the discussion in the School of Brentano\nabout parts and wholes, \u201crelations of relations\u201d and higher\norder objects in general (in various terminologies). In particular,\nEhrenfels\u2019 teacher Alexius Meinong had dedicated a work\nspecifically to the theory of relations (Meinong 1882), which is also\nrepeatedly referred to by Ehrenfels, underscoring that relations are\ncrucially important to his discussion and explicitly pointing out that\nrelations themselves are nothing but Gestalt qualities\n(Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 101). At the same time, and due to more or\nless the same set of influences, Husserl also had used the term\nGestalt and Gestaltmoment to indicate higher-order\nquasi-qualities and the unitary framework of the whole intuition (in a\nlecture from January 1890, see Husserl 2005, and in the 1891\nPhilosophy of Arithmetic, where he switches his terminology to\n\u201cfigural moment\u201d). Despite such anticipations and parallels\n(see also the critical remarks by Zimmer in Albertazzi et al. 2001, 135\nff.), it was Ehrenfels\u2019 work that thematized this whole topic and\nbrought such diverse approaches into focus, thereby turning the\npsychology of Gestalten into a topic in its own right and\nfixating the terminology, problems, and scope of the debate about\nhigher order objects and relations for the years to come.\n It is likely that Ehrenfels\u2019 musical interests, particularly\nWagner\u2019s music and the concept of\n\u201cLeitmotiv\u201d, influenced his idea of\nGestaltqualit\u00e4t and his choice of melodies as a main\nexample. Through Wagner there may be an implicit undercurrent of German\nIdealism and romanticism that in Ehrenfels obtains a\n(Brentanist/Meinongian) psychological formulation (H\u00f6fer 2017,\n34\u201338).\nThe fundamental question with which Ehrenfels begins is the\nfollowing: \u201cIs a melody (i) a mere sum [Zusammenfassung]\nof elements, or (ii) something novel in relation to this sum, something\nthat certainly goes hand in hand with but is distinguishable from the\nsum of elements?\u201d (Ehrenfels 1890, tr. Smith 1988, 83) According\nto Ehrenfels, insofar as Mach spoke of Gestalten as objects of\nsensation, he could not have considered them as \u201cmere sum of\nelements\u201d, but rather as something new. Indeed, Stumpf had\nformulated a similar conclusion, claiming that with fusion the simple\nelements in sensation appear as parts of one greater whole: \u201cthe\nqualities are not in the least changed [\u2026 ] but a new relation\nis introduced between them, which establishes a closer unity than that\nbetween members of a mere sum\u201d (Stumpf 1890, 64). According to\nEhrenfels, as soon as one is committed to the idea that something other\nthan the sum of the tones makes up the melody, \u201cone has in effect\naccepted what we call the tonal Gestalt\u201d (Ehrenfels\n1890; Smith 1988, 91). More precisely:\nLet us suppose, on the one hand, that the series of\ntones t1,\nt2, t3, \u2026, tn, on being sounded, is\napprehended by a conscious subject S as a tonal Gestalt\n(so that the memory-images of all the tones are simultaneously present\nto him); and let us suppose also that the sum of these n tones,\neach with its particular temporal determination, is brought to\npresentation by n unities of consciousness in such a way that each of\nthese n individuals has in his consciousness only one single\ntone-presentation. Then the question arises whether the\nconsciousness S, in apprehending the melody, brings more to his\npresentation than the n distinct individuals taken together.\n(Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 85)\nEhrenfels argues that a Gestalt is more (or at least other)\nthan the sum of its parts, which helps to explain how people can\nremember melodies without having absolute pitch and in different keys,\nwhich would be incompatible with the view of melodies as mere sums of\ntones (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 90 ff.). Based on these preliminary\nobservations and the rejection of simplistic objections, Ehrenfels\nintroduces his definition of a Gestalt:\nBy a Gestalt quality we understand a positive\ncontent of presentation bound up in consciousness with the presence of\ncomplexes of mutually separable (i.e., independently presentable)\nelements. That complex of presentations which is necessary for the\nexistence of a given Gestalt quality we call the foundation\n[Grundlage] of that quality. (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith\n1988, 93)\nFurthermore, he introduces an important distinction here: \u201cWe\ncan however exhaustively partition all possible Gestalt\nqualities into the two non-overlapping categories of temporal and\nnon-temporal.\u201d Specifically, in the case of temporal\nGestalt qualities \u201cat most one element can be given in\nperceptual presentation\u201d, the rest being available only in memory\nor anticipation, while non-temporal Gestalt qualities\n\u201care qualities whose foundation can be given completely in\nperceptual presentation\u201d (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 94).\nHarmony and timbre would be examples of non-temporal\nGestalt qualities and with respect to chords, among others,\nEhrenfels points out that \u201cthe Gestalt quality may\nsometimes force itself into the foreground, i.e., may make demands on\nour attention to such an extent that it is difficult to resolve its\nfoundation into elements\u201d (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 95). This\nshows the need for abstraction to identify the various layers of tonal\ncomplexes, as we find in Stumpf\u2019s (1883, 101) characterization of\nfusion of consonant tones as \u201cless easily and completely\nrecognized as a multiplicity\u201d. Indeed, Ehrenfels also speaks of\nfusion, and like Stumpf (1890, 65 ff., 193), even of fusion (and hence\nGestalten) among different senses:\nThe intimate fusion of touch, temperature and sometimes also\ntaste and smell sensations into a single unified total impression\nraises the question of whether we do not have here Gestalt\nqualities which are built up upon a foundation belonging to several\nsensory regions. [\u2026] we must also accept the possibility of\nGestalt qualities comprehending complexes of elements of\ndifferent categories. (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 97)\nTemporal Gestalt qualities, on the other hand, are\ngenerated by \u201cevery change of any kind in a presentational\ncomplex, providing it proceeds in some definite direction\u201d,\nspecifically, if such change \u201creveals a unified character, so\nthat we have (or could have) a name to designate it\u201d (Ehrenfels\n1890; Smith 1988, 97 ff.), it identifies a Gestalt quality.\nHowever, not only change, but also persistence, such as the sustaining\nof a note, can give rise to a peculiar Gestalt quality\n(Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 101).\nSimilarly to Husserl, who points to collective nouns as identifying\nthe figural moments that characterize Inbegriffe (swarm,\nflock, herd, etc.), Ehrenfels also tries to find helpful indicators in\nordinary language, but cannot but lament the poverty of the available\nterminology:\nWe have to make do with a few words for isolated examples\nfrom the whole range of possible colour changes (e.g. blushing,\nblanching, darkening, glowing, etc.). [\u2026] Beside the musical\ntemporal qualities already considered we have to recognize also such\nnoise or resonance Gestalten as, say, thundering, exploding,\nrustling, splashing, etc. (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 98,\n100)\nEhrenfels proceeds to highlight Gestalt qualities in almost\nevery domain. First of all, relations also fall \u201cunder the\nconcept of Gestalt quality\u201d (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 101),\nsince they consist in a presentational complex of separable elements\n(as in the case of the similarity relation between red and orange),\nthough the two categories cannot be straightforwardly be equated\n(Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 102). Also in the case where elements\ncannot be combined, i.e., logical incompatibility (as in the case of a\nround square), there is nevertheless an unintuitive unity to the\nwhole, which is again a Gestalt quality: \u201cIf I am to\ndeny the existence of a round square, then I must be in a position to\nthink this round square. i.e., to combine the two determinations\nroundness and squareness in some way or other.\u201d (Ehrenfels 1890;\nSmith 1988, 103). Moreover, since one can form unintuitive\npresentations also when the elements are compatible, Ehrenfels argues\nthat the movement of going from an unintuitive to the corresponding\nintuitive presentation gives rise to a Gestalt quality.\nThus anyone confronted with, say, a complicated description\nof a work of architecture will first of all form a merely indirect\npresentation of it, which will then be rounded out by gradual execution\nor fulfilment of the various merely intended components, to yield an\nintuitive total picture. But this process of formation of the intuitive\npresentation directly from the indirect presentation is something that\nhappens, a process of change, which serves as the foundation for a\nspecific temporal Gestalt quality. (Ehrenfels 1890, tr.\nSmith 1988, 104)\nGiven the Gestalt nature of relations, including in\nparticular relations of comparison, Ehrenfels argues that\nGestalten can themselves also be compared to one another and\nhence give rise to increasingly higher order Gestalt\nqualities. Ehrenfels suggest among other things, that temporal\nGestalten can be compared with respect to their rhythm or that\nwe can recognize the composer due to similarities in the melodies\n(Ehrenfels 1890, tr. Smith 1988, 105 ff.).\nImportantly, Ehrenfels also argues that temporal Gestalt\nqualities are not limited to outer perception, but also occur in inner\nperception, where the growing or diminishing of desires, fears,\nexpectations, etc. are compared to a crescendo or diminuendo in music\n(Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 101). With respect to the possibility of\nhigher-order Gestalten, Ehrenfels adds to this the\n\u201cintimate unity with which we combine presentational contents of\nphysical and psychical occurrences\u201d as in all cases of deliberate\nactions \u201cexpressed by means of common nouns (kindness, service,\nrivalry, marriage, theft, war, etc.) or verbs (entreat, complain, help,\nrob, avenge, etc.)\u201d (Ehrenfels 1890;. Smith 1988, 107).\nIf we accept any such \u201cunion of the physical and the\npsychical\u201d as the basis for a Gestalt quality, then of\ncourse Gestalten are to be found everywhere: \u201call\ndesignations of human individuals or groups of whatever kind (Hans and\nPaul, priests, manual workers, Scotsmen, rogues, etc.), as well as most\ndesignations for human corporations and institutions (state, authority,\nthe insurance market, etc.), all names of places and territories, and\nequally all names of animal species\u201d (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988,\n107). This leads straight to Ehrenfels\u2019 remarkable claim that\n\u201cthe larger part of both our everyday and our scientific\nvocabulary designates Gestalt qualities\u201d. Not only does\nevery verb (with the partial exception of being and having and few\nothers) designate a (temporal) Gestalt, but also \u201cevery\nnoun and adjective having reference to more than a single\npresentational element\u201d (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 108).\nYet a problem remains, namely whether Gestalt qualities\narise as a result of some activity on our part when confronted with the\nrelevant complex of elements or without any contribution of the\nintellect. Mach held the latter view, that \u201cGestalten\nare objects of \u2018sensation\u2019 just as soon as their respective\nfoundations are given to consciousness\u201d (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith\n1988, 111). Ehrenfels points out first of all that Gestalten\nare not always noticed (e.g. proverbially seeing the trees but not the\nforest) and some effort seems to be required in grasping a shape by\nfilling out and complementing the Gestalt suggested by the\nfoundations, e.g. when \u201cseeing\u201d the third dimension\nsuggested by the cues of a perspectival drawing (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith\n1988, 111 ff.). While we do not actually generate the Gestalt\nin a separate act, specifically meant to add it to the foundation, we\ndo expend effort in completing the required set of presentational\nelements needed for the Gestalt, which then arises\nspontaneously. This, however, does not exclude that different\nGestalten may supervene on the same foundations and that we\ncan switch between them by changing the focus of our attention. By\nbringing a different complex of presentational elements into the\nforeground, i.e., by varying the foundations, we can also (indirectly)\nvary the Gestalt (Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 112 ff.).\nHaving now found Gestalt qualities nearly everywhere,\nEhrenfels suggests \u201cthat the theory of Gestalt qualities\nwould perhaps be qualified to bridge the gulf between the various\nsensory regions, and indeed between the various categories of the\npresentable in general\u201d (Ehrenfels 1890, Smith 1988, 114), which\nultimately \u201cwould yield the possibility of comprehending the\nwhole of the known world under a single mathematical formula\u201d\n(Ehrenfels 1890; Smith 1988, 116). Indeed, Ehrenfels will go on to\napply the concept of Gestalt in very disparate fields, ranging\nfrom mathematics to cosmology, thereby also bestowing a peculiar unity\nto his entire oeuvre (see Ierna 2017b).\n",
