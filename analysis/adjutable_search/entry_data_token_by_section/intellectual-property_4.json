    "main_text": "The Domain of Intellectual Property || Patents\n2.3 Patents\n\nThe domain or subject matter of patent law is the invention and\ndiscovery of new and useful processes, machines, articles of\nmanufacture, or compositions of matter. There are three types of\npatents recognized by US patent law: utility patents, design patents,\nand plant patents. Utility patents protect any new, useful, and\nnonobvious process, machine, article of manufacture, or composition of\nmatter, as well as any new and useful improvement thereof. Design\npatents protect any new, original, and ornamental design for an\narticle of manufacture. Finally, the subject matter of a plant patent\nis any new variety of plant that is asexually propagated (e.g. rose\nbushes grown by cutting pieces of the stem). Patent protection is the\nstrongest form of intellectual property protection, in that a\ntwenty-year exclusive monopoly is granted to the owner over any\nexpression or implementation of the protected work (35 U.S.C.\n\u00a7101 (1988) and 35 U.S.C. \u00a7154(a)(2)).\n\nAs with copyright, there are restrictions on the domain of patent\nprotection. The U.S. Patent Act requires usefulness, novelty, and\nnon-obviousness of the subject matter. The usefulness requirement is\ntypically deemed satisfied if the invention can accomplish at least\none of its intended purposes. Needless to say, given the expense of\nobtaining a patent, most machines, articles of manufacture, and\nprocesses are useful in this minimal sense.\n\nA more robust requirement on the subject matter of a patent is that\nthe invention defined in the claim for patent protection must be new\nor novel. There are several categories or events, all defined by\nstatute, that can anticipate and invalidate a claim of a patent (35\nU.S.C. \u00a7101 (1988)). In general, the novelty requirement\ninvalidates patent claims if the invention was publicly known before\nthe patent applicant invented it. For example, someone could not\nobtain a patent on the production of stained glass by mixing potash\nand sand, heating the mixture to 3000 Fahrenheit, and then adding\ndifferent metallic oxide powders to produce different colors, even if\nthe inventor in this case independently came up with this process.\n \n\nIn addition to utility and novelty, the third restriction on\npatentability is non-obviousness. United States patent law requires\nthat the invention not be obvious to one ordinarily skilled in the\nrelevant art at the time the invention was made. A hypothetical\nindividual is constructed and the question is asked, \u201cWould this\ninvention be obvious to an expert in the relevant field?\u201d If it\nwould be obvious to this imaginary individual then the patent claim\nfails the test (35 U.S.C. \u00a7103).\n\nIn return for public disclosure and the ensuing dissemination of\ninformation, the patent holder is granted the right to make, use,\nsell, and authorize others to sell the patented item (35 U.S.C.\n\u00a7154 (1984 and Supp. 1989)). The bundle of rights conferred by a\npatent excludes others from making, using, or selling the invention\nregardless of independent creation. Like copyright, patent rights\nlapse after a given period of time\u201420 years for utility and\nplant patents, 14 for design patents. But unlike copyright protection,\nduring their period of applicability these rights preclude others who\nindependently invent the same process or machine from being able to\npatent or market their invention.  \n",
