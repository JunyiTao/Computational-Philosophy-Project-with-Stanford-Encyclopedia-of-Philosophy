    "main_text": "The Value of Work\n2. The Value of Work\n\nThe proposed definition of work as the deliberate attempt to produce\ngoods that others can enjoy or consume indicates where work\u2019s\nvalue to those besides the worker resides. And the value that work has\nto others need not be narrowly defined in terms of specific\nindividuals enjoying or consuming the goods we produce. Within some\nreligious traditions, work is way to serve God and or one\u2019s\ncommunity.\n\nBut these considerations do not shed much light on the first-personal\nvalue of work: What value does one\u2019s work have to\nworkers? How do we benefit when we produce goods that others could\nenjoy?\n",
