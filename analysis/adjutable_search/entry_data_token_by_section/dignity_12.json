    "main_text": "Human Dignity: Touchstones of Analysis || Respect: An alternative lens on dignity\n4. Skeptical Worries\n\nThe conceptual complexity surrounding dignity has sparked a long\nhistory of disagreement about the utility of the concept, with some\nconcluding that it is hopelessly messy or essentially ambiguous. One\nof the more cited versions comes from the Yale bioethicist Ruth\nMacklin, who made this complaint in a widely read 2003 editorial.\n\u201cDignity\u201d, she asserted, \u201cis a useless concept. It\nmeans no more than respect for persons or their autonomy\u201d (2003:\n1419).\n\nMacklin\u2019s claim was not backed by much argument. And judging by\nthe literature, her complaint did nothing to slow down the application\nof dignity in bioethics, where it is now discussed in the context of\neverything from disability studies, elderly care, human research,\ncloning, \u201cchimeras\u201d, enhancement, transhumanism, and\neuthanasia (see the bibliography for leads to each of these). Still,\none does not have to look hard to find Macklin\u2019s allies.\n\nFor example, Rosen (2012a) claims that \u201canimus against dignity\nis widely shared among philosophers, in my experience, and goes back a\nlong way\u201d (2012a: 143). He buttresses his claim by recounting\nthe encouragement of a colleague to give the concept \u201ca good\nkicking\u201d, and by quoting his favorite historical challenges by\nSchopenhauer and Nietzsche, the former of whom called dignity,\n\u201cthe shibboleth of all the perplexed and empty-headed\nmoralists\u201d (1840 [1965: 100] cited in Rosen 2013: 143).\nImportantly, however, for Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, the problem\nwasn\u2019t simply the ambiguity of the concept. They thought that\nthe moralized notion of inherent or distinctive human worth garners\nwidespread credence only because it flatters our pride and allows us\nto slip into self-deceptive moral complacency. This deflationary\nhypothesis strikes at the heart of our modern dignitarian ethos.\n\nSo, exactly how widespread is skepticism of dignity? There is no\nsimple answer to this question because it depends greatly on what one\ntakes dignity to be. Even defenders of one conception of dignity often\nexpress skepticism about other conceptions. For example, we already\nnoted the trend away from thick metaphysical claims about dignity,\nwhich make dignity depend on anything like a divinely implanted\n\u201csoul\u201d or Kant\u2019s \u201cnoumenal\u201d idea of the\nself. Rosen calls such views, \u201cinternal kernel\u201d theories,\nand further notes that reservations about these views are often both\nmetaphysical (no such thing exists) and epistemological (we cannot\njustify our belief in such things). The present point, however, is\nthat if one\u2019s skepticism about human dignity in general turns on\nthe specific reservation about internal kernel theories, then one\nshould stay open minded. For, as we have seen, there are many\nalternatives for theorizing dignity that do not depend on such\nmetaphysical commitments.\n\nStill, because there is more than one way to interpret\nSchopenhauer\u2019s claim that dignity is a \u201cshibboleth\u201d,\nit may prove helpful to trace out a little further a few possible\nskeptical lines of argument, albeit briefly. So, here are four ways\nskepticism tends to play out in the existing literature:\n\nRosen suggests that Schopenhauer\u2019s main complaint\nis that \u201cdignity\u201d is an impressive\n\u201cfa\u00e7ade\u201d obscuring the harsh reality behind the\nidea, namely, that the concept lacks the substance to do the work we\nassign to it. More exactly, dignity cannot serve as a foundation for\nmorality, including, serving as the normative basis of rights (Rosen\n2012a: 143). We encountered this line of thinking already in the\nearlier discussion of the connection between dignity and rights.\nEssentially, the complaint is that no extant account of the\ngrounds of dignity (e.g., Kantian rationalist arguments,\nJudeo-Christian imago Dei arguments, etc.) can satisfactorily\nexplain and justify the kind of normative work dignity is supposed to\ndo. See especially, Sangiovanni 2017, who rejects Aristotelian,\nKantian, and imago Dei accounts of dignity as insufficient\nfor the tasks dignity is typically set to, including grounding\nrights.\n\n\nA related but distinctively different way of taking\nSchopenhauer\u2019s objection, is the worry that dignity has been\npolitically manipulated to capitalize on its deceptive\npotential. As Rosen notes, the general point here is not new.\n\u201cThe idea that illusions are essential to the political\norder\u201d, he writes, \u201cruns through the Western tradition of\npolitical thought from Plato\u201d (2012a: 144). However, Rosen\nsuggests that Nietzsche gets the credit for understanding how powerful\nan illusion human dignity, specifically, can be, for such political\npurpose. \u201cSuch phantoms as the dignity of man\u201d, Nietzsche\nwrites,\n\n\nare the needy products of slavedom hiding itself from itself. Woeful\ntime, in which the slave requires such conceptions, in which he is\nincited to think about and beyond himself! (from \u201cThe Greek\nState\u201d, 1871; quoted in Rosen 2012a: 144)\n\n\nIn fact, this skeptical line goes back further than Rosen seems to\nappreciate. Thus, in his 1714, Fable of the Bees, Bernard\nMandeville essentially made the same argument. Speaking conjecturally\nabout the origins of morality, Mandeville writes:\n\n\nMaking use of this bewitching Engine [of flattery], [the Politicians]\nextoll\u2019d the excellency of our Nature above other\nAnimals\u2026Which being done, they laid before them how unbecoming\nit was the Dignity of such sublime Creatures to be solicitous about\ngratifying those Appetites, which they had in common with Brutes, and\nat the same time unmindful of those higher Qualities that gave them\nthe preeminence over all visible Beings. (1714 [1988: 43])\n \nDignity is vacuous. Bracketing any worries about how any\ngiven political institution manipulates the idea of dignity to achieve\nits ends, or how human pride might capitalize on the idea of dignity\nto facilitate self-deception about our personal moral failings,\nperhaps the idea of dignity is simply unnecessary. For example,\nconsider the first sentence of Article One of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights: \u201cAll human beings are born\nfree and equal in dignity and rights\u201d. What would be lost, Rosen\nasks, \u201cif one were just to say, \u2018All human beings are born\nfree and equal in rights\u2019?\u201d (2012a: 149). A slightly\ndifferent version of this complaint is that, because of its\nvacuousness, dignity has become mere dogma. For example, in the legal\ncontext, Theoder Heuss, called dignity a \u201cnon-interpreted\nthesis\u201d in law. And Costas Douzinas argued dignity was an empty\nplaceholder in a \u201chegemonic battle\u201d of competing legal\nideologies (see also, McCrudden 2013a for some analysis of both; also,\nBargaric & Allan 2006).\nDignity is ambiguous. The thrust of this frequent\ncomplaint is that dignity has become a useless concept, not so much\nbecause it is empty, but because it has too many meanings. (A few have\neven claimed that the concept is \u201cessentially\u201d ambiguous,\nthough it is not clear what this is supposed to mean; see, e.g.,\nShultziner 2007 or Rotenstreich 1983.) When focused, this worry comes\nin three forms:\n\nthe ambiguity of meaning makes \u201cdignity\u201d\nincomprehensible;\nthe ambiguity of meaning makes \u201cdignity\u201d susceptible\nto abuse;\nthe ambiguity of meaning conceals objectionable subjective opinion\nor substantive baggage in the concept of \u201cdignity\u201d.\n \n\n\nExamples of all these positions can easily be found. But perhaps the\nbest illustrations once again come from the legal context. Regarding\n (1):\n see, e.g., Bates (2005), who acknowledges the problem but then tries\nto defend dignity. Regarding\n (2):\n see, e.g., Gearty (2014) and Moyn (2013), who argue that the\ncontinuing ambiguity of dignity make it too easily abused in courtroom\ndeliberation and democratic theories of rights. Regarding\n (3):\n see Pinker (2008), who argues that dignity is a subjective\nphenomenon, \u201crelative, fungible, and often harmful\u201d; also\nRosen (2012a) and Moyn (2013), both of whom argue that our modern\nconcept labors under underappreciated debts to Christian theology;\n\nThese are not all the possible reasons for skepticism about dignity,\nonly the most prevalent. And each is usually sharpened in various ways\nthat make the argument cut deeper than what this summary suggests.\nThis said, the merits of these critiques are disputable. Indeed, much\nof the foregoing analysis in this entry suggests strategies of\nresponse to each.\n\nBut perhaps the most fitting way to conclude is with a different kind\nof question entirely. Namely, how ought we respond to such\nskeptical attacks, if at all? Thus, it is hard not to think of\nFrederick Douglass\u2019s warning, delivered in his 1852\n\u201cFourth of July\u201d speech, about the dangers of demanding of\nanyone, that they argue for their equal and basic human worth\nor status\u2014especially when so many people remain not simply\noppressed, but exposed to vitriolic hate in a world that constantly\nproclaims its faith and commitment in the ideal of human dignity.\n\u201cAt a time like this\u201d, Douglass said, \u201cscorching\nirony, not convincing argument, is needed\u201d (1852: 20).\n",
