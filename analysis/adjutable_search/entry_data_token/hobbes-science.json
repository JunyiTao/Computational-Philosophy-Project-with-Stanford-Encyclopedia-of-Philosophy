The scholarly\nliterature on Leviathan is voluminous and has been especially\nfocused upon issues in political philosophy, such as representation\nand authorization, sovereignty and absolutism, contracts and\ncovenants, and the relationship of civil authority to religion, among\nothers. Since its printing the portrayal in Leviathan XIII of\nhumans in their natural state\u2014an existence that is\n\u201csolitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\u201d\u2014has\nstruck the imagination of many of Hobbes\u2019 readers, leaving many\nseeing Hobbes as pessimistic at best or hopelessly unrealistic at\nworst.\n\nIn Hobbes\u2019 own time, however, he was also well-known, even if\nsometimes ridiculed, for his views in mathematics, natural philosophy,\nand optics. In A Minute or First Draught of the Optiques\n(1646), Hobbes\u2019 own assessment of his work is laudatory:\n\n\n\u2026I shall deserve the Reputation of having been the first to lay\nthe ground of two Sciences, this of Opticques, the most curious, and\nthat other of natural Justice, which I have done in my book de Cive,\nthe most profitable of all other. (Hobbes 1646 [1983: 622])\n\n\nAlthough some contemporaries saw promise in Hobbes\u2019 optics, such\nas Mersenne, who published Hobbes\u2019 work in this area in 1644 in\nBallistica, in the years following the publication of\nLeviathan Hobbes\u2019 pursuits apart from political\nphilosophy were taken less seriously. There are a number of possible\nexplanations for this decline in the opinion of Hobbes\u2019\ncompetence in these areas, including his numerous attempts to square\nthe circle, the association of his views with atheism by many critics,\nand the conflicts he had with Robert Boyle at the time of the rise of\nexperimental philosophy. These all contributed to some extent to\nHobbes\u2019 exclusion from the Royal Society when it was\nfounded.\n\nIf Hobbes\u2019 mathematical and natural-philosophical endeavors\nfailed to be taken seriously by his contemporaries near the end of his\nlife, what purpose is served by understanding these failed\n attempts?[1]\n Apart from interest in them on their own terms as episodes in the\nhistory of science and philosophy, there are several reasons why we\nmay find these areas of Hobbes\u2019 thought valuable for study.\nFirst, Hobbes himself understood his political philosophy, or as he\ncalled it \u201ccivil philosophy\u201d, to be a science capable of\ndemonstration. Thus, understanding his general views about the nature\nof scientific demonstration promises to shed light on the way in which\nhe saw civil philosophy as scientific. Second, Hobbes understood\nnatural-philosophical explanations in physics as needing to make use\nof mathematical principles to count, as he says, as \u201ctrue\nphysics\u201d and to be useful for improving humans\u2019 quality of\nlife. This claim about the use of mathematics to explain natural\nphenomena may seem banal to a twenty-first century reader, but it was\nnot so to many in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\nHobbes\u2019 natural philosophy thus situates him within the shift\nfrom qualitative to quantitative physics. Third, Hobbes\u2019\nconflicts with the Royal Society show us not only his views of the\nrole of experimentation but also contextualize the rise of\nexperimentalism. After discussing Hobbes\u2019 criteria for\nscientific knowledge, this entry will address each of these areas.\n", "toc": [{"#CritForScieKnow": "1.

The Criteria for Scientific Knowledge\n\nThe fundamental aspects of Hobbes\u2019 materialism are well known.\nHobbes believed that everything that exists is a body, and that bodies\nare sometimes in motion and sometimes at rest. Furthermore, he held\nthat the only essential property of body is extension, or magnitude.\nAll other apparent properties of bodies, such as those of color,\ntaste, and firmness, are the result of motions from bodies being\ncontinued through media to humans\u2019 sense organs. These motions,\nwhen continued into the bodies of perceivers, are constitutive of\nconceptions, or\n ideas.[2]\n Ideas of the objects of sense are caused by motions from things\noutside of perceivers and those continued motions constitute ideas and\nserve to individuate one idea from another. Thus, all ideas in the\nhuman mind are either from sense perception or derived from ideas\ngained from sense perception (Leviathan I; LEV 22).\n\nThis account of the origin and nature of ideas shows Hobbes\u2019\nclear empiricist leanings; however, Hobbes does not hold that knowers\nshould uncritically accept what the ideas of sense objects seem to\nrepresent. Like many other philosophers in the seventeenth century,\nHobbes held that our knowledge of the external world was not direct\nbut was instead mediated by ideas. This recognition that \u201cwe\ncompute nothing but our phantasms or ideas\u201d (Hobbes\n1642\u201343 [1973: 450]; cf. OL\n I.82)[3]\n resulted in two worries about human knowledge.\n\nFirst, knowers must examine what resemblance ideas in the mind have to\nobjects in the outside world. This worry seems similar, at first\nglance, to the concerns of Descartes\u2019 meditator in the\nMeditations on First Philosophy (1641), but Hobbes aimed to\nprovide a solution that made no reference whatsoever to God or to\nanything at all immaterial, such as a soul. In the early work\nElements of Law, composed in 1640 and published in 1650 (EL),\nHobbes offered arguments that attempted to show that ideas are\ndistinct from that which they purport to represent, and he claimed\nthat as a result we could know that the so-called secondary qualities,\nsuch as color, taste, and sound, were not in bodies. To do this, he\nused everyday experience to provide evidence for his claims:\n\n\nEvery man hath so much experience as to have seen the sun and other\nvisible objects by reflection in the water and in glasses, and this\nalone is sufficient for this conclusion: that colour and image may be\nthere where the thing seen is not. (Elements of Law II.5; EL\n3)\n\n\nHe used similar considerations in Leviathan I, concluding\nthat we can know, for example, that color and sound are not in bodies\nsince if they were \u201cthey could not bee severed from them, as by\nglasses, and in Ecchoes by reflection\u201d (LEV 24).\n\nA second worry that follows from Hobbes\u2019 view that we have only\nmediated access to bodies in the world relates to the possibility of\ngaining knowledge of the causes of natural events. Most of the ideas\nthat knowers possess of bodies are received passively. When interested\nin the cause of some phenomenon, all one may examine are ideas caused\nby the motions of the bodies involved. However, when interested in,\nsay, the cause of billiard ball B being put into motion after\napparent contact with moving billiard ball A, one does not\nfind an idea of A being the cause of B\u2019s\nmotion. Even if one were to look to a lower \u2018level\u2019, as it\nwere, smaller than billiard balls by use of a microscope, one would\nnot find any idea of A\u2019s motion causing\nB\u2019s motion. Hobbes diagnosed this lack of causal\nknowledge by highlighting that human agents are not the makers of\nnatural phenomena. He thought that makers gain this causal knowledge\nby attending to their constructions through the process of creating\nsomething. Since we lack the ideas of the causes of individual\nphenomena from our experience, Hobbes claimed that we cannot know\ntheir actual causes at all. All that we may know are possible causes.\nHobbes asserted in Six Lessons to the Professors of\nMathematiques (1656) that because \u201cof natural bodies we\nknow not the construction but seek it from the effects\u201d we can\nknow \u201conly of what [the causes] may be\u201d (EW VII.184).\n\nThis second worry brings to the fore Hobbes\u2019 condition for the\npossibility of scientific knowledge, namely, the possession of\n(actual) causal knowledge. He claimed that\n\n\nwe are said to know [scire] some effect when we know what its\ncauses are, in what subject they are, in what subject they introduce\nthe effect and how they do it. Therefore, this is the knowledge\n[scientia] \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\n\u03b4\u03b9\u1f79\u03c4\u03b9 or of causes. (OL I.59)\n\n\nHaving scientific knowledge required one to know the actual causes of\na phenomenon, not its mere possible causes. However, the only way to\npossess such causal knowledge is to act as a maker, as God did in the\ncase of natural things.\n\nThis restriction that Hobbes made allowed him to consider only\ngeometry and civil philosophy as bodies of scientific knowledge, since\nin only these two disciplines do humans make the objects that they\nstudy. In Six Lessons to the Professors of Mathematiques,\nHobbes distinguished these two disciplines from all others by\nconnecting them to making:\n\n\nGeometry therefore is demonstrable for the lines and figures from\nwhich we reason are drawn and described by ourselves and civil\nphilosophy is demonstrable because we make the commonwealth ourselves.\n(EW VII.184)\n\n\nIn the three following sections, this entry considers ways in which\nthese two bodies of scientific knowledge are used within other\ndisciplines to provide an epistemic grounding for the explanations\ntherein. In natural philosophy, or physics, Hobbes borrowed\ngeometrical principles to provide the cause\u2014the reason\n\u2018why\u2019\u2014for many phenomena, while the making of the\ncommonwealth, and its laws, out of the state of nature was the genesis\nof the science of civil philosophy.\n2. The Use of Mathematics and Hypotheses in Scientific Explanations\n\nThere has been debate among scholars of Hobbes\u2019 thought about\nthe relationship of the different parts of his philosophy to one\nanother. Much of the focus has been upon the methodological statements\nin Part I of De Corpore, and scholars have traditionally\ndivided over whether Hobbes understood philosophy as unified or\ndisunified. However, more recent scholarship has drawn attention to\nHobbes\u2019 practice of explanation, such as the explanations found\nin De Corpore Part IV, and has argued that aspects of both\nthe unified and disunified views track Hobbes\u2019 discussions and\npractice while those views on their own miss that Hobbes explicitly\nborrowed principles from mathematics to use in natural philosophy (and\nprovided citations to show this activity). This section will discuss\nthese three approaches to understanding how the parts of Hobbes\u2019\nsystem fit with one another and then provide an example of an\nexplanation in Hobbes\u2019 natural philosophy from De\nCorpore XXV.\n\nFirst, the unified view. A significant number of scholars have argued\nthat Hobbes understood his philosophy as unified by deductive\nconnections between the different parts (for example, Martinich 2005;\nPeters 1967; Shapin & Schaffer 1985; Watkins 1965). A stronger\nversion of this unified view understands Hobbes to be a type of\nreductionist, wherein descriptions of macroscopic bodies, such as\nhumans and rocks, ultimately reduce to microscopic bodies responsible\nfor all phenomena (for example, Hampton 1986; Ryan 1970). For example,\nAlan Ryan articulates the reductionist view as follows:\n\n\nHobbes believed as firmly as one could that all behaviour, whether of\nanimate or inanimate matter, was ultimately to be explained in terms\nof particulate motion: the laws governing the motions of discrete\nmaterial particles were the ultimate laws of the universe, and in this\nsense psychology must be rooted in physiology and physiology in\nphysics, while the social sciences, especially the technology of\nstatecraft, must be rooted in psychology. (1970: 102\u2013103)\n\n\nThere is some textual support for understanding the parts of\nHobbes\u2019 system as either deductively or reductively linked\ntogether since he did at times talk of the parts of philosophy as\nbeginning in first philosophy and leading from one to another. For\nexample, he asserted in De Corpore VI.6 that by beginning at\nfirst principles, one will move from first philosophy to geometry, and\nfrom geometry to physics. He continued by claiming that \u201cafter\nphysics we come to morals\u201d and, indeed, Hobbes claims that moral\nphilosophy must be studied after physics because the passions have\n\u201ctheir causes in sense-experience and imagination\u201d (CSL\n299; OL I.64).\n\nHowever, immediately following these statements that seem to indicate\nthat Hobbes took his philosophy to be tightly knit together, he argued\nthat \u201ccivil and moral philosophy do not so adhere to one\nanother, but that they may be severed\u201d (EW I.73). This\nseparation is permissible, Hobbes claimed, because in addition to\nlearning moral philosophy from first principles each individual could\nsimply study the motions of their own mind and gain knowledge of the\nsame principles. That such separation could occur is difficult to\nexplain for a strong version of the unified view because it makes it\nappear that Hobbes thought that one could develop civil philosophy\nsimply by introspecting, entirely independently of any work in moral\nphilosophy, natural philosophy, and first philosophy.\n\nA further difficulty for the unified view is that even if Hobbes did\nsee the connection between, say, physics and moral philosophy as\ndeductive, it is not obvious how that deduction would work because\nmoral philosophy must add content about human passions (endeavors)\nthat is not contained within\u2014and thus not deducible\nfrom\u2014physics. For example, although the concept\n\u2018endeavor\u2019 is introduced in physics, for it to be used in\nmoral philosophy the concepts of \u2018appetite\u2019 and\n\u2018aversion\u2019, which are properties of human bodies, must be\nadded to it for use (Malcolm 2002: 147). One way to avoid this\ndifficulty for the unified view would be to provide evidence that\nHobbes made explicit the reduction relationship between concepts like\n\u2018appetite\u2019 and \u2018aversion\u2019 and the concept of\n\u2018endeavour\u2019, showing how one can reduce claims about human\nbodies to claims about microscopic bodies. Hobbes does not appear to\ndo this anywhere in the corpus. However, even if a strong version of\nthe unified view faces this difficulty, the presence of\n\u2018endeavor\u2019 throughout Hobbes\u2019 philosophy shows that\nit was a foundational concept (see Jesseph 2016).\n\nThe second major view of the relationship of the parts of\nHobbes\u2019 philosophy to one another is what we can call the\ndisunified view (for example, see Robertson 1886; Taylor 1938;\nWarrender 1957). Some of the motivation behind the disunified account\nseems to be a desire to free Hobbes from what is prima facie a case of\nderiving normative claims relating to the commonwealth in civil\nphilosophy from descriptive claims related to human psychology and,\nultimately, more general claims in natural philosophy (especially\nTaylor 1938). However, in its attempts to rescue Hobbes from a version\nof the so-called naturalistic fallacy, the disunified account fails to\ntake seriously Hobbes\u2019 claims about the unity of his philosophy.\nFurthermore, it neglects that many of Hobbes\u2019 contemporaries\n(for example, Bramhall) saw Hobbes\u2019 views in natural philosophy\nas having far-reaching consequences for other areas of philosophy.\n\nA third view has more recently been offered that seeks to carve a\nmiddle path between the unified and disunified interpretations. We can\ncall this view the mixed-mathematics view (for example, Adams 2016,\n2017; Biener 2016). This understanding of Hobbes\u2019 system agrees\nwith the worry raised above for the unified account that\n\u2018higher\u2019 levels, such as geometry, do not contain the\nconcepts used in \u2018lower\u2019 level explanations. For example,\nalthough geometrical principles are used in Hobbes\u2019 optical\nexplanations those geometrical principles do not contain concepts such\nas \u2018light\u2019 or \u2018color\u2019. Some evidence for this\nlack of containment claim can be found on the well-known \u201cTable\nof the Several Subjects of Science\u201d in Leviathan IX.\nThe \u201csciences\u201d on this table are listed on the right-most\nsection and their subjects are to the immediate left. The subject of\nthe science of optics, for example, is all of the \u201cconsequences\nfrom vision\u201d, and these stem from \u201cPhysics or consequences\nfrom qualities\u201d. The science of geometry, however, has as its\nsubject the \u201cconsequences from quantity, and motion\ndetermined\u2026 by figure\u201d and these stem not from physics\nbut from \u201cconsequences from the accidents common to all bodies\nnatural; which are quantity and motion\u201d.\n\nInstead of seeing this \u201cadding to\u201d as evidence for the\ndisunified view, the mixed-mathematics view understands Hobbes having\nseen certain disciplines as providing causal principles (what he\ncalled the \u2018why\u2019) while other disciplines provided the\nfacts relevant to a given domain (what he called the\n\u2018that\u2019). Textual support for this understanding of\nHobbes\u2019 system can be found in Hobbes\u2019 methodological\nstatements about natural philosophy as well as in his practice of\nexplanation.\n\nAs mentioned already, Hobbes identified scientific knowledge\n(scientia) with knowing causes, and in his discussions he\nused language germane to Aristotle\u2019s distinction between the\n\u2018why\u2019 and the \u2018that\u2019. We have seen already\nHobbes\u2019 commitment to knowing through the causes, but the\ncomplete passage from De Corpore VI.1 provides further detail\nabout Hobbes\u2019 views on the two types of knowledge, as\nfollows:\n\n\nWe are said to know [scire] some effect when we know what its\ncauses are, in what subject they are, in what subject they introduce\nthe effect and how they do it. Therefore, this is the knowledge\n[scientia] \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\n\u03b4\u03b9\u1f79\u03c4\u03b9 or of causes. All other knowledge\n[cognitio], which is called \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\n\u1f45\u03c4\u03b9, is either sense experience or imagination\nremaining in sense experience or memory (De Corpore VI.1; CSL\n287\u2013289).\n\n\nTwo types of knowledge thus emerge. There is knowledge from sense\nexperience, retained as imagination and eventually as memory (more\nbelow on how this can develop into prudence), and there is scientific\nknowledge. When reflecting in De Homine on the status of\nclaims in physics, Hobbes claims that what he calls \u201ctrue\nphysics\u201d must be a mixture of both of these types of\nknowledge:\n\n\n[\u2026] since one cannot proceed in reasoning about natural things\nthat are brought about by motion from the effects to the causes\nwithout a knowledge of those things that follow from that kind of\nmotion; and since one cannot proceed to the consequences of motions\nwithout a knowledge of quantity, which is geometry; nothing can be\ndemonstrated by physics without something also being demonstrated\na priori. Therefore physics (I mean true physics) [vera\nphysica], that depends on geometry, is usually numbered among the\nmixed mathematics [mathematicas mixtas]. [.] Therefore those\nmathematics are pure which (like geometry and arithmetic) revolve\naround quantities in the abstract so that work [in them] requires no\nknowledge of the subject; those mathematics are mixed, in truth, which\nin their reasoning some quality of the subject is also considered, as\nis the case with astronomy, music, physics, and the parts of physics\nthat can vary on account of the variety of species and the parts of\nthe universe. (MC 42; OL II.93)\n\n\nThese two statements concerning the status of different types of\nknowledge and the requirement to mix \u201cquantities in the\nabstract\u201d with \u201csome quality of the subject\u201d in\nphysics can aid in making sense of Hobbes\u2019 actual explanatory\npractice. What does it mean for physics to be \u201cmixed\nmathematics\u201d? For Hobbes it means that for many explanations one\nwill first establish that some fact is the case by appealing to sense\nexperience, but to give the reason why one must borrow a principle\nfrom geometry.\n\nAt several places in De Corpore, Hobbes appears to carry out\nthe mixed-mathematics ideal by showing, with a citation, that he used\na causal principle from geometry within an explanation that included\ndetails about the \u201cquality of the subject.\u201d For example,\nin De Corpore XXV, the chapter with which Hobbes began Part\nIV, Hobbes appears to have done just this when he explained sensation.\nIn that explanation, he appealed both to \u201cqualities of the\nsubject\u201d, such as the claim based upon experience that \u201cwe\nmay observe\u2026 that our phantasms or ideas are not always the\nsame\u201d (EW I.389), and by citing and using causal principles from\nearlier in the work (see discussion of this explanation in Adams\n 2016).[4]\n\nSuch behavior\u2014borrowing and citing a principle within an\nexplanation\u2014would be difficult to explain on the picture offered\nby the unified view since Hobbes offers no justification for this\npractice other than phrases such as \u201cI have shown\nbesides\u2026\u201d. There is no deduction anywhere offered within\nHobbes\u2019 actual explanatory practice that would give reason to\nthink that Hobbes understood the use of these principles from\nelsewhere in the work in that way. Likewise, it is difficult to make\nsense of this activity within Hobbes\u2019 actual practice if we\nadopt the disunified view of Hobbes\u2019 philosophy, since by using\nprinciples from elsewhere in the system, and especially by explicitly\nciting them, Hobbes is signaling that the parts of his system did fit\ntogether, even if not in the strong reductive sense of the unified\nview. The next section will describe Hobbes\u2019 view that work in\nfirst philosophy and geometry must be done prior to experiments.\n3. Hobbes on Experimentation: Conflict with Robert Boyle and the Royal Society\n\nHobbes\u2019 conflict with Robert Boyle concerning the nature of\nnatural philosophy in general, and the air-pump experiments in\nparticular, took place over several years and in a series of\n publications.[5]\n Hobbes wrote Dialogus Physicus (1661; a second version\nappeared in\n 1668)[6]\n as a dialogue aimed at criticizing Boyle\u2019s New Experiments\nPhysico-Mechanical (1660). Boyle responded to various criticisms\nin works such as An Examen of Mr. T. Hobbes his Dialogus Physicus\nde Natura A\u00ebris (1662), An Examen of Mr. Hobbes\u2019\nDoctrine about Cold (1665), and Animadversions upon Mr.\nHobbes\u2019 Problemata de Vacuo (1674). The most comprehensive\nand influential treatment of this period of Hobbes\u2019 life is\nShapin and Schaffer\u2019s Leviathan and the Air-Pump\n (1985).[7]\n This section will focus upon Hobbes\u2019 criticisms of the air-pump\nexperiments in the Dialogus Physicus with an aim of showing\nhow they illuminate our understanding of Hobbes\u2019 natural\nphilosophy.\n\nMost generally both Boyle and Hobbes viewed the natural world as\ncomposed of bits of matter in motion. Even if there were some points\nof agreement between the versions of mechanical philosophy offered by\nboth Boyle and\n Hobbes,[8]\n there are important differences. A crucial difference between the two\nrelates to the status (or lack thereof) of Laws of Nature. While Boyle\ntalked about the laws of nature as established by God (see the section on\n Laws of Nature in the entry on Boyle),\n Hobbes restricted discussion of laws to the laws of human conduct\ndiscovered by those who escape the state of nature and create a\ncommonwealth. In contrast to laws of the natural world, Hobbes\narticulated a priori principles of motion at the foundation\nof his physics in De Corpore VIII.19 and IX.7. Rather than\nbeing known as laws of motion, issued by some divine lawmaker, these\nHobbesian principles of motion are explicated by thought experiments\nand seem to rely upon a version of the principle of sufficient reason\n(Jesseph 2006: 132). Although Hobbes held that they were true of all\nhuman experience, since Hobbes holds that we cannot know the actual\ncauses of natural phenomena he would have to admit that nature might,\nunbeknownst to us, act otherwise. However, despite these differences,\nthe primary dissimilarity that emerges between Hobbes and Boyle\nconcerning the air-pump experiments is one of method as it relates to\nthe status of experiments/experience (see the section on\n Philosophy of Experiment in the entry on Boyle).\n\nGiven that Hobbes was convinced of the impossibility of knowing the\nactual causes of natural phenomena, he held that any phenomenon admits\nof multiple possible explanations. This should not be taken to imply\nthat Hobbes saw all explanations, and thus all possible causes or\nsuppositions, as standing on equal footing. Instead, Hobbes held that\nwork in first philosophy and geometry must be completed prior to\nattempting to make any explanations in natural philosophy. This seems\nto be what Hobbes meant in the De Homine extended quotation\nprovided above when he said that \u201cnothing can be demonstrated by\nphysics without something also being demonstrated a\npriori\u201d (MC 42; OL II.93). When giving an explanation,\nHobbes held that one should ideally appeal to those causes that are\ndemonstrable from geometry when mixed with facts and rule out those\nthat are not intelligible according to geometrical principles.\n\nIn contrast, Boyle\u2019s method prescribed that instead of bringing\ncausal principles to an experiment and expecting to explain some\nphenomenon by appeal to those principles, one should attempt to arrive\nat a supposition that would explain a phenomenon only after repeated,\ncareful experiments. Thomas Sprat detailed the care taken in the\ndesign of experiments and the manner in which Royal Society members\nwere formed into committees that shared parts of an experiment so that\n\u201c[b]y this union of eyes, and hands\u201d they were able to\ngain \u201ca full comprehension of the object in all its\nappearances\u201d (Sprat 1667: 85).\n\nWe can make sense of Hobbes\u2019 direct criticisms of Boyle\u2019s\nprioritization of experiment with this methodological difference in\nmind. Hobbes\u2019 view of the foundational role played by first\nphilosophy and mathematics over experiment/experience is clear when he\nclaimed in Dialogus Physicus that\n\n\n\u2026ingenuity is one thing and method is another. Here method is\nneeded. The causes of those things done by motion are to be\ninvestigated through a knowledge of motion, the knowledge of which,\nthe noblest part of geometry, is hitherto untouched. (DP 347; OL\nIV.236)\n\n\nAccording to Hobbes, then, one must have geometrical principles\nalready in place to aid in choosing a supposition before engaging in\nexperiments. Unlike the Royal Society\u2019s aim to have multiple\nmembers examine the same object, Hobbes emphasized the need for\nindividual conceptual clarity, something that could be accomplished\nfrom an armchair.\n\nThis criticism from Hobbes, and Boyle\u2019s rebuttals relying upon\nevidence from experiments, could be seen as a conflict of\nBoyle\u2019s experimental natural philosophy against a form of\nspeculative natural\n philosophy.[9]\n However, it is important to avoid taking Hobbes\u2019 criticisms of\nBoyle\u2019s method to imply that Hobbes completely eschewed\nexperiment/experience while engaging in natural-philosophical\nexplanations. Indeed, Hobbes held that both natural history and civil\nhistory are \u201cuseful (no, indeed necessary) for philosophy\u201d\n(CSL 189; OL I.9). Experiment/experience play the role of establishing\nthat some phenomenon occurs, what we have seen Hobbes called the\n\u2018that\u2019, but one should never hope, according to Hobbes, to\nglean a possible cause from mere observations, even if those\nobservations were carefully documented and repeated many times.\n\nThis is clear when in the Dialogus Physicus Hobbes, speaking\nthrough speaker A, often granted the observational reports of the\nexperimenters without question. For example, speaker A does not\nquestion what the experimenters claim they observed regarding a\nbladder that had been placed inside the air-pump and weighed, noting\n\u201cThey can be certain that the scale in which the bladder is, is\nmore depressed than the other, their eyes bearing witness\u201d (DP\n369; OL IV.261). Instead of criticizing the experimenters\u2019\nreliance upon observations, speaker A argues that the experimenters\ncannot know, in the case of this explanation, what the cause of the\nscale being depressed is because their posited cause (the\n\u201cnatural gravity\u201d of the air) does not allow them to\nexplain why the scale is depressed after the air-pump is engaged. In\ncontrast, speaker A offers a possible cause that is borrowed, with an\nexplicit citation, from Hobbes\u2019 geometrical account of\n\u201csimple circle motion\u201d and \u201cfermentation\u201d\ndeveloped in De Corpore 21.5 (Adams 2017).\n4. Hobbes on the Value of Using Scientia in Natural Philosophy\n\nThe preceding sections have outlined Hobbes\u2019s views concerning\nwhy principles from geometry can be used within explanations\nin natural philosophy and his claim that before engaging in\nexperimentation one must have principles from geometry ready for use.\nStill one might wonder why Hobbes thought that this approach, inspired\nby \u201cmixed mathematics\u201d, would be more successful than the\nmethods of Boyle and his colleagues in the Royal Society. Indeed, what\nwas the aim of engaging in natural philosophy according to Hobbes?\nThis section describes Hobbes\u2019 view that the aim of natural\nphilosophy is to bring positive benefits to humans\u2019 quality of\nlife and then contrasts Hobbes\u2019s view on the usefulness and\nlimitations of \u201cprudence\u201d with the usefulness of natural\nphilosophy that employs scientia. \n\nAs mentioned already, Hobbes is well known for holding that all ideas\nin the mind are either from sense or derived from those that are\n(Leviathan I; LEV 22). Hobbes also linked\n\u201ctrains\u201d of ideas in the mind to sense by asserting that\njust as \u201cwe have no Imagination, whereof we have not formerly\nhad Sense, in whole, or in parts; so we have no Transition from one\nImagination to another, whereof we never had the like before in our\nSense\u201d (Leviathan III; LEV 38). Hobbes divided these\ntrains of ideas into those that are guided and those that are\nunguided. Unguided trains explain what happens when the human mind\nwanders from idea to idea, such as when daydreaming. Hobbes described\nthese unguided trains as the \u201cwild ranging of the mind\u201d,\nand he noted that some might think that the connecting points in such\ntrains are by chance even if they are not. He compared such unguided\ntrains to a dialogue between conversants that began on one topic (the\npresent civil war) but over time seemed to drift to other topics by\nchance (concluding with a question about the price of a Roman penny).\nAlthough the connecting points between these topics of conversation\n(and the trains of ideas they signify in each conversant\u2019s mind)\nmay not be immediately obvious, Hobbes suggested that there was a\ncoherence to each transition. Hobbes traced this coherence in the\nexample he provided as follows:\n\n\u2026 the Thought of the warre, introduced the Thought of the\ndelivering up the King to his Enemies; The Thought of that, brought in\nthe Thought of the delivering up of Christ; and that again the Thought\nof the 30 pence, which was the price of that treason: and thence\neasily followed that malicious question; and all this in a moment of\ntime; for Thought is quick. (Leviathan III; LEV 40).\n\n\nHobbes intended the comparison between this example of a conversation\nand the way that unguided trains of ideas move from idea to idea to\nhave a general output: no matter how seemingly disconnected the links\nof any train of ideas may seem, there is always a coherent\nexplanation, whether it is obvious or not, that would explain them.\n\n\nIn contrast to the seemingly disconnected wanderings of the mind that\noccur with unguided trains, Hobbes saw guided trains of ideas as\ntransitions from idea to idea that were investigated by the mind with\nsome end or goal in view. Say that someone desired to eat a delicious\ndish that incorporated a particular type of meat and certain spices\nand herbs. If they desired to bring about that result, they would\nsearch through the trains of ideas in their mind, received from past\nsense experiences, until they found trains that terminated in that\ngoal. When they found a train that had the end result that they were\nseeking, they would trace back, idea by idea, until they found a\n\u201cbeginning\u201d that was within their current ability to\nproduce (Leviathan III; LEV 40). Continuing the example of a\ndesired dish, say that the individual found that a prior train of\nideas that termined with the desired end began with harvesting a\nparticular herb at a particular time of year. They would attempt to\nbring that \u201cbeginning\u201d about and, if successful, would\nmove on to the next idea in the train. There are no guarantees that\nthis would work, since the links in the train may be merely\nprobablistically connected to one another. Hobbes held that humans and\nnon-human animals shared this form of reasoning, which he identified\nas a type of causal inquiry: \u201c\u2026when of an effect\nimagined, wee seek the causes, or means to produce it\u201d\n(Leviathan III; LEV 40). Given the limitations mentioned\nalready related to knowing the causes of natural phenomena, Hobbes\ncould only have meant that possible causes can be identified\nby this process.\n\nHobbes connects prudence with an ability to engage in this type of\nreasoning on a broader scale. Individuals who have acquired much\nexperience, and thus have a large stock of trains of ideas at their\ndisposal, can make predictions about future events that may occur. For\nexample, on the basis of cooking hundreds of dishes with hundreds of\ningredients, a prudent individual could look at a given list of\ningredients and predict whether the outcome will likely be delicious\nor not. Hobbes thought that the more experience such an individual\nhad, the better the prediction would be: \u201c\u2026by how much\none man has more experiences of things past, than another; by so much\nalso he is more Prudent\u201d (Leviathan III; LEV 42).\nPrudence is valuable for the human knower, but no matter how useful\nprudence may be, Hobbes thought that it could never arise above being\nbased upon mere associational connections between ideas. Instances of\nA have always been followed by B, so the prudent\nperson would reason, thus the A that has presently occurred\nwill likely be followed by B. Hobbes thought that this type\nof prediction by means of associations amounted to a mere presumption\nof what the future would look like (Leviathan III; LEV 44).\nIn other words, this inference required \u201csupposing like events\nwill follow like actions\u201d (Leviathan III; LEV 42), but\nthat supposition might prove false and the inference would fail.\nFurthermore, any difference between prior antecedents and a current\ninitial condition could result in a failure on the part of the prudent\nindividual to predict successfully, as Hobbes noted:\n\u201c\u2026the omission of every little circumstance altering the\neffect, frustrateth the expectation of the most Prudent\u201d\n(Leviathan XLVI; LEV 1052). While useful in many everyday\nsituations, Hobbes thought that prudence showed its limitations when a\nknower encountered a novel situation.\n\nIf predictions made upon the basis of associations among ideas were\nthe extent of human knowledge of natural phenomena, it would seem that\nHobbes should have wholeheartedly endorsed the approach of the\nexperimental philosophy championed by Boyle and others. What are\nBoylean experiments if not repeated experiences in which one tries to\ncontrol for potential confounding variables, at least according to how\nHobbes saw them (Boyle would not agree with this\ncharacterization; see the section on\n Philosophy of Experiment in the entry on Boyle)?\n Hobbes saw experienced-based prudence as useful, but he denied that\nit counted as true knowledge of the future, which he held was\navailable only to the one by whose \u201cwill\u201d an event happens\n(Leviathan III; LEV 44). Hobbes\u2019s solution for moving\nbeyond mere associations required knowers to play an active role by\ncreating artificial objects (like the objects of geometry). Such\nknowledge (scientia) was more useful for predictions because\nit provided power to its holders, as he noted in De Corpore\n1.6: \u201cknowledge is the for the sake of power [Scientia\npropter potentiam]\u201d (OL I.6).\n\nUnlike association-based predictions, which are limited by the extent\nto which the prior antecedents resemble a current scenario and rest on\na presumption that the future will resemble the past, knowing the\ncauses of some event because one brought it about by one\u2019s will\nallowed one to understand its true nature. Hobbes thought that this\n\u201cpower\u201d provided direct benefits that improved the quality\nof human living, such as the marking of \u201cmoments in time\u201d\nand \u201cmapping the face of the earth\u201d (OL I.6\u20137). Similarly,\nthe science of civil philosophy (discussed more in the next section)\ncould help prevent civil war and other calamities (OL I.8). Hobbes\nrecognized that many citizens may not see the value of\nscientia because they fail to understand it: \u201cFor\nScience is of that nature, as none can understand it to be, but such\nas in good measure have attayned it\u201d (Leviathan X; LEV\n134). Furthermore, he admitted that many citizens would confuse the\ncause of success in the \u201carts of publique use\u201d; although\nthe reason why such arts produce effective fortifications and other\n\u201cInstruments of War\u201d lies in their use of principles from\nthe science of geometry, many will think that the inventor of such\ninstruments is responsible and because of this \u201cthe Midwife [the\nartificer] pass[es] with the vulgar for the Mother\u201d when the\n\u201cmother\u201d is really mathematics (Leviathan X; LEV\n134).\n\nIf the solution to moving beyond association-based prudence was to use\ngeometrical principles within natural philosophy, why did Hobbes think\nthis? As mentioned already, in Six Lessons (1656) Hobbes\nclaimed that because \u201cof natural bodies we know not the\nconstruction but seek it from the effects\u201d we can know\n\u201conly of what [the causes] may be\u201d (EW VII.184). A claim\nlike this might make it seem like the natural philosopher simply\nguesses cause might be responsible for a given phenomenon,\nbut Hobbes held that not all possible causes are on equal epistemic\nfooting. Hobbes\u2019s method of natural philosophy that mixes\nmathematical principles (the \u2018why\u2019) with observations from\nexperience (the \u2018that\u2019) rejected what Hobbes thought of as\na merely passive approach to understanding nature. In contrast, in the\nLetter to the Reader of De Corpore Hobbes compares\nphilosophizing to God\u2019s act of the creation of the world:\n\n\nIf you are going to pay serious attention to philosophy, let your\nreason hover over the confused abyss of your thoughts and experiences.\nThe confused things must be shaken violently, distinguished, and\nordered, having been marked with their own names, that is, in method\n[Methodo] it must be according to the creation of things\nthemselves. (OL I. Letter to Reader)\n\n\nUnlike what Hobbes saw as the passive approach of conducting and\nobserving experiments, which would provide associations in the form of\ntrains of ideas and eventually prudence, Hobbes thought natural\nphilosophy should imitate God\u2019s activity. The only way for\nnatural philosophy to provide the benefits that Hobbes saw following\nfrom it was for it to combine observations with certain knowledge from\nscientia. The result was that explanations in natural\nphilosophy were epistemically between mere associational prudence and\nthe certainty of scientia. We could thus characterize\nexplanations in Hobbes\u2019 natural philosophy as having\nhypothetical certainty. The natural philosopher cannot know with\ncertainty that nature behaves as an explanation claims. However, given\nthat they borrow causal principles from geometry, they can know that\nif nature behaved as they suppose, then certain\nconsequences would follow of necessity.\n5. The Prospects for a Science of Civil Philosophy\n\nHobbes thought that he would be renowned as the founder of civil\nphilosophy just as he saw Copernicus as having initiated the\n\u201cbeginning of astronomy\u201d, Galileo as having opened the\n\u201cgate of natural philosophy universal\u201d with an account of\nthe \u201cnature of motion\u201d, and William Harvey as having first\ndiscovered the \u201cscience of man\u2019s body\u201d (see the\ndedicatory epistle to De Corpore; EW I.viii). He asserted\nthat while \u201cNatural Philosophy is\u2026 young\u201d, civil\nphilosophy itself is \u201cno older than\u2026 [his] own book De\nCive\u201d (EW I.ix). As a student of historical texts in their\noriginal\n languages,[10]\n Hobbes was well aware of many works from antiquity to his own time\naddressing issues relevant to civil philosophy. By claiming civil\nphilosophy was his invention, he intended to deny that any of those\npreceding works counted as philosophy.\n\nWhat did Hobbes see as distinguishing his work in civil philosophy\nfrom all predecessors? As points of contrast, Hobbes mentioned the\nSophists who \u201ctaught \u2026 [only how] to dispute\u201d and\nChristian theologians who introduced \u201cschool divinity\u201d, by\nwhich Hobbes meant the blending of teachings from Scripture with\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy. For the latter, Hobbes saw the best\n\u201cexorcism\u201d to be the distinction between the subject\nmatters of religion, which were the \u201crules for honouring\nGod\u201d, and philosophy, which was concerned with the\n\u201copinions of private men\u201d (EW I.xi). What distinguished\nreligion from philosophy in this sense, Hobbes continued, is that\nphilosophy provides either demonstrations from definitions or\ndemonstrations from \u201csuppositions not absurd\u201d.\n\nSo far it seems that there are two criteria relevant to civil\nphilosophy that Hobbes saw as setting his apart from all other\nattempts. First, Hobbesian civil philosophy is a science\n(scientia) because human makers have the ability to know the\nactual causes of the objects of study since they construct them.\nSecond, to count as philosophy and not mere superstition or sophistry,\nHobbesian civil philosophy must provide demonstrations.\n\nHow exactly Hobbes\u2019 use of \u2018demonstration\u2019 should be\nunderstood as it relates to civil philosophy has been a subject of\ndebate among Hobbes scholars over the past several decades. Much of\nthe focus of this debate has been concerning the Laws of Nature in\nLeviathan XIV and XV. Why restrict the scope of demonstrable\ncivil philosophy to two chapters of Leviathan? Why not\ninclude, for example, Leviathan Parts III (\u201cOf A\nChristian Commonwealth\u201d) and IV (\u201cOf The Kingdom of\nDarkness\u201d)? Alternatively, why not also include chapters from\nPart II (\u201cOf Commonwealth\u201d), especially chapter XVII\n(\u201cOf the Causes, Generation, and Definition of a\nCommonwealth\u201d)? One motivation for focus upon chapters XIV and\nXV is that in those chapters Hobbes seems to have indicated that he\nsaw a deductive relationship between the laws of nature by using the\nlanguage one might expect in a demonstration. For example, Hobbes\ndescribed the second law of nature as being \u201cderived from\u201d\nthe first law (LEV 200). The remainder of this section will focus on\ntwo ways of understanding Hobbes\u2019 civil philosophy as a\ndemonstration.\n\nOne way of understanding Hobbes\u2019 claim that civil philosophy is\ndemonstrable connects it to Euclidean geometry. This view has been\ncalled the \u201cdefinitivist\u201d or \u201cdefinitional\u201d\nview because of its emphasis on the importance of definitions in\nHobbes\u2019 philosophy. One articulation of the definitivist view\nunderstands Hobbes\u2019 definition of \u2018law of nature\u2019 in\nLeviathan as playing a role similar to an axiom in Euclidean\ngeometry (Deigh 1996). In Leviathan XIV, a law of nature is\ndefined as\n\n\na Precept, or generall Rule, found out by Reason, by which a man is\nforbidden to do, that, which is destructive of his life, or taketh\naway the means of preserving the same; and to omit, that, by which he\nthinketh it may be best preserved. (LEV 198)\n\n\nThe definivist further claims that like Euclidean axioms Hobbes did\nnot view this axiom\u2014the definition of \u2018law of\nnature\u2019\u2014as requiring demonstration; instead, he derived\nthe first law of nature from it and then derived the others one from\nanother. Why is Hobbesian civil philosophy a demonstrable science on\nthis view? Simply put, it is a demonstrable science because it follows\nthe method of Euclidean geometry, viewed by Hobbes and others as the\nmodel of scientific knowledge on account of its clarity and\n rigor.[11]\n\nA virtue of the definitivist view is that it takes seriously\nHobbes\u2019 claim that civil philosophy is demonstrable. However, a\ndifficulty faced by the definitivist view, along with any other that\nunderstands Hobbes as drawing inspiration from Euclid, is that Hobbes\nhimself harshly criticized Euclidean definitions, arguing that\nEuclid\u2019s definitions \u201cought not be numbered among the\nprinciples of geometry\u201d because they did not contain the causes\nof what was to be constructed (EW VII.184). Furthermore, Hobbes\ncriticized the nature of the objects of Euclidean geometry. For\nexample, Hobbes argued against understanding lines as being without\nbreadth since there are no such bodies in nature (EW VII.202).\nAdditionally, Hobbes himself did not ground his own geometry in\nundemonstrated axioms and held that even Euclidean axioms needed to be\ndemonstrated (OL I.72; OL I.119).\n\nA second difficulty for the definitivist view lies in its inability to\naccommodate the laws of nature as commands (Hoekstra 2003: 115). If\nthe laws of nature were derived from the definition of \u2018law of\nnature\u2019, it would be difficult to see how they could then take\nthe form of instructions to perform some action. Indeed, the laws of\nnature take the form of instructions to do this or that, such as the\nfirst law of nature\n\n\nThat every man, ought to endeavour Peace, as farre as he has of\nobtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek, and use,\nall helps, and advantages of Warre. (LEV 200)\n\n\nBeyond the first and second laws of nature, the remaining laws contain\ninstructions concerning what should be done to accomplish peace, that\nis, they command it, such as the third law of nature which commands\n\u201cThat men performe their Covenants made\u201d (LEV 220).\n\nAn alternative account, what has been called the \u201cmaker\u2019s\nknowledge\u201d view of Hobbes\u2019 civil philosophy, attempts to\nconnect Hobbes\u2019 demonstrations and definitions in geometry with\ncivil philosophy. This view avoids the two difficulties faced by the\ndefinitivist account mentioned above and holds that Hobbesian civil\nphilosophy is demonstrable by appealing to Hobbes\u2019 own\nunderstanding of what constitutes a demonstration (Adams 2019). The\nremainder of this section will discuss two features of the\n\u201cmaker\u2019s knowledge\u201d account of Hobbesian civil\nphilosophy.\n\nFirst, a requirement for geometrical definitions, which Hobbes\nstressed in multiple contexts, is that they must provide the causes of\nthe things being defined. For example, Hobbes claimed that the\ndefinition of \u2018line\u2019 should be as follows: \u201ca line\nis made by the motion of a point\u201d (OL I.63). Likewise, a plane\nis made by the motion of a line. Perhaps Hobbes understood all of the\nlaws of nature to be like this type of geometrical definition, but\ninstead of the definition of something like \u2018line\u2019 they\nserved as the definition of (and thus how to make) peace. That is,\nwhen following all of the laws of nature one could make peace just as\nby following the generative instructions contained in the definition\nof \u2018line\u2019 one could make a line.\n\nSecond, a demonstration for Hobbes did not involve the derivation of\nfeatures by means of deduction. Such deductions would provide one with\nknowledge of what was already contained in the starting proposition,\nmaking it difficult to see how commands could be derived from the\ndefinition of \u2018law of nature\u2019 in Leviathan XIV.\nHowever, Hobbes explicitly said that demonstrations should be\nsynthetic, wherein one builds the complex thing to be demonstrated out\nof simpler constituent parts. A demonstration, Hobbes asserted, should\nbe understood as a showing of some construction to someone else (OL\nI.76) and, as a result, he claimed that \u201centire method of\ndemonstrating is synthetic\u201d (OL I.71). By\n\u2018synthesis\u2019 Hobbes means that one shows how something is\nput together to reach the desired end, one shows how that thing is\nmade.\n\nThe maker\u2019s knowledge view of Hobbes\u2019 civil philosophy\ndraws insight from these two points and understands Hobbesian civil\nphilosophy as demonstrable in the following way. Hobbes begins civil\nphilosophy at a starting point in the \u201cnatural condition\u201d\nof human bodies in Leviathan XIII, continues by considering\nhow those bodies could be moved (by commands in the laws of nature) in\nways that would be conducive of peace and, finally, are brought\ntogether to compose the commonwealth.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3> Works by Hobbes\n\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "[EW] 1839\u20131845, <em>The English Works of Thomas Hobbes</em>,\n11 volumes, William Molesworth (ed.), London: John Bohn.\n [<a href=\"http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/metabook?id=hobbesworks\" target=\"other\">EW available online</a>]", "[OL] 1839\u20131845, <em>Thom\u00e6 Hobbes malmesburiensis opera\nphilosophica</em>, 5 volumes, William Molesworth (ed.), London: John\nBohn.", "[EL] 1640/1650 [1928], <em>The Elements of Law</em>, Ferdinand\nT\u00f6nnies (ed.), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.", "1642\u201343 [1973], <em>Critique du de Mundo de Thomas\nWhite</em>, Jean Jacquot and Harold W.
