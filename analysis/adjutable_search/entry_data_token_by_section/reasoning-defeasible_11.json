If one predicts\nwhat will, or what would, under some hypothesis, happen, one must\npresume that there are no unknown factors that might interfere with\nthose factors and conditions that are known. Any prediction can be\nupset by such unanticipated interventions. Prediction thus proceeds\nfrom the assumption that the situation as modeled constitutes a\nclosed world: that nothing outside that situation could\nintrude in time to upset one\u2019s predictions. In addition, we seem\nto presume that any factor that is not known to be causally relevant\nis in fact causally irrelevant, since we are constantly encountering\nnew factors and novel combinations of factors, and it is impossible to\nverify their causal irrelevance in advance. This closed-world\nassumption is one of the principal motivations for McCarthy\u2019s\nlogic of circumscription (McCarthy 1982; McCarthy 1986).\n",
