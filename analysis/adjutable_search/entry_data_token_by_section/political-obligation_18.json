    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Political Obligation || Natural Duty\n5. Conclusion: A Plurality of Principles?\n\nThe four theories of political obligation sketched above do not\nexhaust the possibilities \u2013 Dorota Mokrosinska, for instance,\nhas recently advanced a \u201ccivil justice\u201d theory in her\nRethinking Political Obligation \u2013 but they seem to\nrepresent the main lines of argument. Indeed, even Mokrosinska\nacknowledges that her \u201cargument from civil justice combines\nelements of both natural duty accounts and associative theories\u201d\n(2012, p. 174). In fact, the search for a hybrid theory is something a\nnumber of philosophers have undertaken, either implicitly or\nexplicitly, in recent years. Gilbert (2006) and Steinberger (2004),\nfor example, seem to have developed hybrid theories without ever\nadvertising them as such. Gilbert\u2019s theory fuses the consent and\nassociative approaches through her reliance on joint\ncommitments to a plural subject, or group. For his part,\nSteinberger combines the consent and natural-duty approaches, arguing\nthat any \u201cgeneralized attempt to divorce obligations from\nnatural duties, to find justifications for the former that are\nentirely independent of the latter, is \u2026 doomed to fail\u201d\n(2004, p. 211). Wellman explicitly acknowledges the hybrid nature of\nhis theory, which combines an appeal to the natural duty of\nsamaritanism with reliance on the argument from fair play (Wellman\n2005, esp. chap 2).\n\nOthers, notably Klosko (2005), Jonathan Wolff (1995, 2000), and Dudley\nKnowles (2010) have explicitly called for a pluralistic or\nmultiple-principle approach to political obligation. There is no\nsingle answer to the problem of political obligation, as they see it,\nbecause the problem has more than one aspect. Not every\n\u201cmember\u201d of a polity will stand in the same relation to\nthe laws, for instance, which means that it is a mistake to think that\neveryone must have the same general obligation to obey. Nor is every\nobligation of equal force. Some are weak, such as the notorious\nobligation to stop at a traffic signal in an isolated area when no one\nelse is around, and others are quite strong. Klosko thus thinks it\nnecessary to rely on the principle of fairness to supply the core of a\njustification, but to supplement it with appeals to natural duty and\nthe common good (2006, chap. 5).\n\nAs yet there has been little reaction to these attempts to create\nhybrids and to draw on multiple principles in the attempt to provide a\nsatisfactory theory of political obligation (but see Edmundson 2004,\npp. 250\u201352). Those who doubt that such a theory can be\nconstructed, however, are likely to say that combining principles,\nwhether in hybrid or pluralist fashion, will not help, for combining a\nset of principles that are unsatisfactory individually will hardly\nproduce a strong and satisfying theory (Simmons 2007, n. 17). Whether\na plurality of principles is necessary or even desirable, in sum,\nremains one of many open questions with regard to the vexing problem\nof political obligation.\n",
