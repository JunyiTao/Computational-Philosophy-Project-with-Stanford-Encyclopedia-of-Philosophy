    "main_text": "19th-Century Views on Progress\n4. 19th-Century Views on Progress \n\nThe 19th-century writers on progress took up and elaborated the notion\nthat conflict is an essential part of a progressive narrative.\nG.W.F. Hegel (1770\u20131831) is an example of such a writer. Hegel does\nnot give a straightforward account of human progress. But he puts a\nversion of universal history at the center of his metaphysics, from\nwhich a narrative of progress can be derived.  According to Hegel, the\nworld as a whole is in the process of development through conflict.\nPart of the world's development is the self-realization of its\nspiritual aspect, known simply as Geist, or Spirit.  The\nfreedom of Spirit is achieved through the achievement of free social\ninstitutions and free human beings.  So, we look to human history to\nunderstand the realization of Spirit.  Conversely we recognize that\nthe self-realization of Spirit, an entity not reducible to humanity,\nis the true meaning of human history.\n\n\nThe state is crucial to Hegel's philosophy of history.  For\nHegel, the state is the \u201cmarch of God [Spirit] in the\nworld\u201d (1821, \u00a7258Z).  At any point in time, a state or\ngroup of states represent the highest point achieved by humanity thus\nfar.  Hegel thinks that at the time of his writing, the states of\nWestern Europe play this role.  In the Philosophy of Right,\nhe argues that these states, however imperfectly, combine individual\nfreedom with social unity into one enduring whole.  The political\nconstitution of the society he describes is a constitutional monarchy.\nIt approximates the never-adopted constitution that Prussian reformers\ndrew up in 1819 (Wood 1990, 13).\n\n\nHistory, according to Hegel's metaphysical account, is driven by\nideological development.  Ideological\u2014and therefore\nhistorical\u2014change occurs when a new idea is nurtured in the\nenvironment of the old one, and eventually overtakes it.  Thus\ndevelopment necessarily involves periods of conflict when the old and\nnew ideas clash.  A second account of change is contained in the\nmaster-slave dialectic of Hegel's Phenomenology of\nSpirit (1807, 143\u2013152; 192\u2013198 ).  Certain forms of social\nhierarchy are intrinsically unstable.  The human desire for\nrecognition drives social development, which consists of repeated\nstruggles for recognition, until it reaches the liberal solution.  In\nthe liberal state, slave and masters are abolished, and all recognize\nall as free and equal.  This arrangement lacks the contradictions\ninherent in previous social forms.\n\n\nAccording to Hegel, conflict occurs within and between states.  But\n\u201cworld-historical\u201d (1988, 35) individuals, like Napolean\nBonaparte, also have a key part to play in driving history forward.\nThese great men are often motivated by narrow, personal goals.  Hegel\npaints a disturbing picture of the historical tendency of great men to\n\u201ctrample\u201d on and use ordinary ones, but he thinks great men\nare ultimately tools as well\u2014of Spirit and its self-realization\n(1988, 35).  Hegel's justification of war and destruction in the\nname of progress reflects his overall philosophy.  He holds that we\ncan be reconciled to negative elements by seeing their place within a\nlarger pattern.  In the Phenomenology of Spirit, he\nsummarizes his thesis in the following slogan: \u201cThe true is the\nwhole\u201d (1807, 11).\n\n\nFinally, in contrast to Kant, Hegel thinks that war is more than an\nengine of progress. Hegel argues that, without war, individuals in\nliberal societies become self-absorbed and weak, unwilling to work for\nthe common good.  There is moreover no outlet for human aggression.\nFor these reasons, war is ineliminable.  It will be a feature even of\nthe rational system of states that marks the end of historical\ndevelopment.\n\n\nKarl Marx (1818\u20131883) adopted Hegel's single-factor model of\nhistorical development but \u201cturned [Hegel] right side up\u201d\n(1873, 302) by replacing his idealism with materialism. According to\nMarx, the fundamental fact about a society at a given moment is not\nits ideological orientation but rather its \u201cproductive\nforces\u201d (1845, 150), by which Marx means its material and\ntechnological resources.  Over the long run, the productive forces\ndetermine other aspects of the society, starting with the relations of\nproduction, the informal and formal rules that define and regulate\nproperty (1845, 151).  Marx builds on these assumptions to define\ncapitalism and communism and to predict the former's eventual\ntransformation into the latter.\n\n\nLike Hegel, Marx asserts that conflict drives historical development.\nBut in Marx's account, conflict occurs when the productive\nforces outgrow the relations of production (1845, 196).  A different\nclass of society represents each side of the conflict.  The class that\nbenefits from the outmoded relations of production seeks to maintain\nthem, while the losing class seeks to destroy them and replace them.\nFor instance, capitalism emerged from feudal aristocracy when the\nmerchants, through revolution, rewrote the laws in their favor (1848,\n477\u20138, 484).  Capitalism is a system in which land and labor are\ncommodities able to be bought and sold on the free market.  Marx\npredicts that communism will emerge from capitalism because the\nproductive forces developed within a capitalist society will\neventually make capitalist property rights unworkable (1848, 477).  At\nthis point, the working class, or proletariat, will successfully\noverthrow the old order (1845, 161\u20132).\n\n\nMarx's philosophy of history can seem like a deterministic\nmaterialism that ignores ideas and passes no judgment on the change it\ndescribes.  However, this picture is incomplete.  First of all, Marx\nthinks that consciousness of historical trends will guide at least\nsome of the future revolutionaries (1848, 481).  Second, Marx clearly\nthinks that communism is superior to capitalism because it eliminates\nbarriers to freedom such as alienation and exploitation and replaces\nthem with a community of free producers (1845, 197).  Marx's\nearly writings\u2014published after his death\u2014show that the\nvalue of freedom was as central a concern for him as it was for Kant\nor Hegel.\n\n\nAmong 19th-century thinkers, the French sociologist Auguste Comte\n(1798\u20131857) puts relatively little emphasis on violence and struggle\nas a source of change.  Comte actually coined the term\n\u201cSociology\u201d (1853 v. 2, 201) to describe the scientific\ntreatment of human societies and their development.  Comte saw himself\nas giving sociology its content in addition to its name.  But many of\nhis arguments are not particularly original, including his most\nfundamental claim, that intellectual improvement drives progress\n(v. 2, 307).  His real contribution is to claim that intellectual\ndevelopment should be understood as change in the form of explanation\nemployed by individuals seeking to understand the world.  The form of\nexplanation affects social life insofar as it corresponds to a way of\npredicting and manipulating events.  It is true that this argument is\nimplicit in the writings of earlier thinkers such as Turgot and\nCondorcet.  But, unlike his predecessors, Comte works it out\nsystematically.\n\n\nComte's main sociological law is that every science goes through\nthree stages, which he terms the theological, the metaphysical, and\nthe positive (1853, v. 1, 2).  In the theological stage, scientific explanation\nis governed by the assumption that natural events are caused by divinities.  \nIn turn, \nhumans attempt to affect natural outcomes by appealing directly to the gods or \nGod to take action. The metaphysical stage follows, in which phenomena are \nexplained by referring to the abstract\nessences that entities are supposed to possess.  The third phase, the\npositive phase, explains phenomena by formulating scientific laws and\nthen subsuming individual phenomena under them (2).  Humans cannot\nchange these laws, but they can use their knowledge of them to predict\nand shape events.  The positive stage is the most modest in its\nepistemological aspirations.  Unlike the other two, it organizes\nappearances rather than looking beyond them (v. 1, 2, 4). However, it\nis the most successful of the three stages in guiding human\nintervention into nature.  This is no accident, since the same\npractical concerns that motivate scientific activity drive scientific\ndevelopment.  For Comte, the ultimate motivation for scientific\nactivity is practical: \u201cFrom Science Comes Prevision: From\nPrevision Comes Action\u201d (1853, v. 1, 21).\n\n\nWhile Comte holds that the driving force of human progress is\nintellectual development, he asserts that progress itself consists in\nmoral improvement.  Comte refrains from claiming that humans are\nbecoming subjectively happier (1853, v. 2, 232).  Instead, despite his\nrejection of Aristotelian metaphysics, Comte invokes a form of human\nflourishing akin to Aristotle's in the Nicomachean\nEthics (1097b22\u20131098a17).  Comte claims that human excellence is\nexercising the uniquely human capacity for reason.  The human race is\nprogressing because humans are becoming more rational and less\nemotional (v. 2, 299).\n\n\nIn the final part of his career, Comte turned his attention to\npolitical theory.  He had already rejected as\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d certain building blocks of the theory of\nliberal democracy, including popular sovereignty (1853, v. 2, 155\u20136)\nand liberty of conscience (v. 2, 151).  In System of Positive\nPolity, he envisions a socialist society governed by a few\nunelected officials, who are in turn educated and advised by an elite\npriesthood of social scientists (1875 (51), 82).  Guided by the\nprinciple that the temporal and spiritual powers of society should be \nseparate, Comte emphasizes that the priests of positivism should not exercise\npolitical leadership themselves (170).  Comte appeals to the same principle to\njustify the exclusion of women from public life (197).  He explains that\nwomen wield spiritual power as mothers and wives (260\u20131), \nand their spiritual authority would be jeopardized if they were to pursue a \nvocation outside the family.\n\n\nJohn Stuart Mill (1806\u20131873), Comte's contemporary, admired his\nprogressive philosophy of history (Mill 1865, 106) and shared his\nrespect for scientific expertise (97).  But Mill was disappointed by\nComte's basic distaste for democratic freedom and individuality\n(Mill 1865, 181).  Unlike Comte, Mill thought that a strong,\nscientifically oriented society could be a liberal democracy.  Such a\nsociety would best maintain the gains already achieved and nurture\nfurther improvement.  Mill articulates his twin commitment to progress\nand liberal democracy in his major writings, including A System of\nLogic (1843), Utilitarianism (1861), On Liberty\n(1859), and On Representative Government (1861).\n\n\nMill's writings establish connections among utility, liberty,\nand political institutions. Like his father, James Mill, and Jeremy\nBentham, Mill is a utilitarian. Utility, or aggregate pleasure (1861b,\n137), provides the ultimate standard for comparing two historical eras\nor two contemporaneous societies.  The claim that humanity is\nprogressing means that utility is increasing over time.  Then, in \nA System of Logic, Mill, following Comte (606), argues that the\ndevelopment of ideas drives the development of society as a whole\n(604).  Finally, in On Liberty and On Representative\nGovernment, Mill considers how a society's institutions can\nretard or accelerate ideological development.\n\n\nMill thinks that it is impossible to find a single set of institutions\nthat is progressive for all times and places.  The most that we can do\nis to specify what institutions are best for societies at a given\nlevel of civilization.  Mill controversially argues that despotic\ngovernments may push \u201cbarbarians\u201d to the next level of\ncivilization (1859, 14\u201315). But Mill argues that in more advanced\nsocieties, free institutions promote further progress.  They do so by\nallowing ideological conflict, which is a powerful engine of\nideological development.  Mill worries about the transition from one\nset of institutions to another.  Civilizations can reach a certain\nlevel of development and then stagnate because they do not undergo\ninstitutional change (1861a, 234\u20135).\n\n\nDespite his reputation as a classic Victorian progressive, Mill is\nmore cautious and less deterministic than the other 19th-century\nwriters treated by this essay.  He believes that continued improvement\nis possible, but not by any means inevitable.  Progress in Europe will\ncome to a halt if institutions silence society's creative\nmembers (1859, 80\u201382).  Mill's works derive their urgency from\nthe fact that he clearly thinks they can make a real\ndifference.  On Liberty focuses on the argument for\ngovernment non-interference.  On Representative Government\ndiscusses some of the ways that democratic institutions could be\nreformed to promote different points of view actively.\n\n\nA fellow Victorian philosopher, Herbert Spencer (1820\u20131903) is much\nmore deterministic than Mill.  Spencer views human progress as one\naspect of a universe in perpetual development.  Spencer constructs his\nexplanatory framework from materials from the biological sciences.  He\nis keenly interested in theories of biological evolution, both\nLamarckian and then Darwinian.\n\n\nUnderstanding Spencer's theoretical orientation requires some\nbackground in 19th-century biology.  Darwin's theory of evolution was\nnot the first modern attempt to account for diversity of life on the\nplanet without invoking an act of divine creation (Levins and\nLewontin, 1985, 27\u201328).  Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744\u20131829)\nexplained the apparent match between each animal species and its\nenvironment by positing that individual animals could acquire and pass\non adaptive characteristics.  This explanation requires, first of all,\nthat animals strive to adapt to their environment.  Second, it\nrequires that the animals change physically as a result of their\nefforts, and third, that they pass on their acquired characteristics\nto their offspring (Levins and Lewontin, 30).  In contrast, Darwin\nhypothesized that randomly occurring variation among individual\norganisms could be preserved or destroyed in the population of\norganisms through differential reproductive success.  That is, he\nconjectured that some characteristics are correlated with the ability\nto produce a greater number of offspring.  These characteristics will\ntend to increase in a population over time.  Darwin called this\nmechanism natural selection.  Natural selection bypasses the\nproblematic assumption that individual organisms could alter\nthemselves through deliberate effort.  Yet it can still explain why\norganisms seem to fit into their natural environment so well (Levins\nand Lewontin, 1985, 31\u201334).\n\n\nIn Social Statics, Spencer asserts that evil is never\npermanent (59).  He reasons to this conclusion from two premises.\nFirst, he defines evil as the \u201cnon-adaptation of constitution to\nconditions\u201d (1841, 59).  Second, he claims that all living\nbeings gradually change to fit into their environment (59\u201360).  He\nlists a great number of natural phenomena that supposedly illustrate\nthis law (60).  At the point of writing, Spencer was a Lamarckian, but\nhe later maintained essentially this argument as a proponent of\nDarwinism. Evil in the human sense exists because human beings, by\nvirtue of their selfishness, are unsuited to social living.  But this\nvariety of evil, like all evil, will pass away as humans adapt to their\ncircumstances.  He defines progress as the evolution of humans from\nselfishness to selflessness (1841, 63).\n\n\nIn \u201cProgress, its Law and Cause,\u201d Spencer makes a\ndifferent argument.  He defines progress as \u201can advance from\nhomogeneity of structure to heterogeneity of structure\u201d (1857,\nv. 1, 9).  Progress occurs by way of \u201csuccessive\ndifferentiations\u201d (10).  The law of progress is simply that\n\u201cevery active force produces more than one change\u2014every\ncause produces more than one effect\u201d (37).  Spencer claims that\nall phenomena exhibit the same development from the simple to the\ncomplex for this same reason.  He finds evidence for progress in\nastronomy (10\u201311), geology (12\u201313), and linguistics (23\u20134).\n\n\nThe modern literature on progress generally argues that European\nscience, culture, and institutions are the best in the world at the\ntime the author is writing.  But claims or insinuations that Europeans\nare biologically superior are rarer.  Turgot, as we have seen, states\nthat individual genius occurs as frequently among non-Europeans as\namong Europeans.  Nor do Mill's claims for European superiority\nrest on biological arguments (1859, 80).  In other words, the\nparadigmatic progress narrative shows Europeans setting the standards\nand then the rest of the world catching up until everyone is a full\nparticipant in an enlightened order.\n\n\nThe introduction of biological evolution into writings on progress\nenabled a new form of Eurocentrism, one founded on biological\nracism.  Spencer enlists evolutionary theory to claim that different\nraces of human beings exist and form a clear hierarchy: \u201cThe\ncivilized man departs more widely from the general type of the\nplacental mammalia than do the lower human races\u201d (1857, 18).\nThis includes mental characteristics: \u201cJudging from the greater extent\nand variety of faculty he exhibits, we may infer that the civilized\nman has also a more complex or heterogenous nervous system than the\nuncivilized man\u201d (1857, 18).  Spencer's racism is central to his\nview of humans as a group and of human potential.  Ultimately it calls\ninto question whether he can be said truly to propose an account of\nprogress.\n\n",
