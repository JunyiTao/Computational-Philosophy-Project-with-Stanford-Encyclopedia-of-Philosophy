    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe philosophical debate over innate ideas and their role in the \nacquisition of knowledge has a venerable history. It is thus \nsurprising that very little attention was paid until early last \ncentury to the questions of how linguistic knowledge is \nacquired and what role, if any, innate ideas might play in that \nprocess.\n\n\nTo be sure, many theorists have recognized the crucial part played by\nlanguage in our lives, and have speculated about the (syntactic \nand/or semantic) properties of language that enable it to play that \nrole. However, few had much to say about the properties of \nus in virtue of which we can learn and use a natural language. \nTo the extent that philosophers before the 20th century dealt with \nlanguage acquisition at all, they tended to see it as a product of \nour general ability to reason \u2014 an ability that makes us \nspecial, and that sets us apart from other animals, but that is not \ntailored for language learning in particular.\n\n\nIn Part 5 of the Discourse on the Method, for instance, \nDescartes identifies the ability to use language as one of two \nfeatures distinguishing people from \u201cmachines\u201d or \n\u201cbeasts\u201d and speculates that even the stupidest people \ncan learn a language (when not even the smartest beast can do so) \nbecause human beings have a \u201crational soul\u201d and beasts \n\u201chave no intelligence at all.\u201d (Descartes 1984: 140-1.) \nLike other great philosopher-psychologists of the past, Descartes \nseems to have regarded our acquisition of concepts and knowledge \n(\u2018ideas\u2019) as the main psychological mystery, taking \nlanguage acquisition to be a relatively trivial matter in comparison;\nas he puts it, albeit ironically, \u201cit patently requires very \nlittle reason to be able to speak.\u201d (1984: 140.)\n\n\nAll this changed in the early twentieth century, when linguists, \npsychologists, and philosophers began to look more closely at the \nphenomena of language learning and mastery. With advances in syntax \nand semantics came the realization that knowing a language was not \nmerely a matter of associating words with concepts. It also crucially\ninvolves knowledge of how to put words together, for it's \ntypically sentences that we use to express our thoughts, not words in\nisolation.\n\n\nIf that's the case, though, language mastery can be no simple matter.\nModern linguistic theories have shown that human languages are vastly\ncomplex objects. The syntactic rules governing sentence formation and\nthe semantic rules governing the assignment of meanings to sentences \nand phrases are immensely complicated, yet language users apparently \napply them hundreds or thousands of times a day, quite effortlessly \nand unconsciously. But if knowing a language is a matter of knowing \nall these obscure rules, then acquiring a language emerges as the \nmonumental task of learning them all. Thus arose the \nquestion that has driven much of modern linguistic theory: How could \nmere children learn the myriad intricate rules that govern linguistic\nexpression and comprehension in their language \u2014 and learn them\nsolely from exposure to the language spoken around them?\n\n\nClearly, there is something very special about the brains of human \nbeings that enables them to master a natural language \u2014 a feat \nusually more or less completed by age 8 or so. \u00a72.1 of this \narticle introduces the idea, most closely associated with the work of\nthe MIT linguist Noam Chomsky, that what is special about human \nbrains is that they contain a specialized \u2018language \norgan,\u2019 an innate mental \u2018module\u2019 or \n\u2018faculty,\u2019 that is dedicated to the task of mastering a \nlanguage.\n\n\nOn Chomsky's view, the language faculty contains innate knowledge of \nvarious linguistic rules, constraints and principles; this innate \nknowledge constitutes the \u2018initial state\u2019 of the language\nfaculty. In interaction with one's experiences of language during \nchildhood \u2014 that is, with one's exposure to what Chomsky calls \nthe \u2018primary linguistic data\u2019 or \n\u2018pld\u2019 (see \u00a72.1) \u2014 it gives rise to a\nnew body of linguistic knowledge, namely, knowledge of a specific \nlanguage (like Chinese or English). This \u2018attained\u2019 or \n\u2018final\u2019 state of the language faculty constitutes one's \n\u2018linguistic competence\u2019 and includes knowledge of the \ngrammar of one's language. This knowledge, according to Chomsky, is \nessential to our ability to speak and understand a language \n(although, of course, it is not sufficient for this ability: much \nadditional knowledge is brought to bear in \u2018linguistic \nperformance,\u2019 that is, actual language \n use).[1]\n\n\n\n\u00a7\u00a72.2-2.5 discuss the main arguments used by Chomsky and \nothers to support this \u2018nativist\u2019 view that what makes \nlanguage acquisition possible is the fact that much of our linguistic\nknowledge is unlearned; it is innate or inborn, part of the initial \nstate of the language \n faculty.[2]\n Section 3 presents a number of other avenues \nof research that have been argued to bear on the innateness of \nlanguage, and shows how recent empirical research about language \nlearning and the brain may challenge the nativist position. Because \nmuch of this material is very new, and because my conclusions (many \nof which are tentative) are highly controversial, more references to \nthe empirical literature than are normal in an encyclopedia article \nare included. The reader is encouraged to follow up on the research \ncited and assess the plausibility of linguistic nativism for him or \nherself: whether language is innate or not is, after all, an \nempirical issue.\n",
