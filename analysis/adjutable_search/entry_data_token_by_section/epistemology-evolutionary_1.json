This\ninvolves a straightforward extension of the biological theory of\nevolution to those aspects or traits of animals which are the\nbiological substrates of cognitive activity, e.g., their brains,\nsensory systems, motor systems, etc. The other program attempts to\naccount for the evolution of ideas, scientific theories, epistemic\nnorms and culture in general by using models and metaphors drawn from\nevolutionary biology. Both programs have their roots in 19th century\nbiology and social philosophy, in the work of Darwin, Spencer, James\nand others. There have been a number of attempts in the intervening\nyears to develop the programs in detail (see Campbell 1974a, Bradie\n1986, Cziko 1995). Much of the contemporary work in evolutionary\nepistemology derives from the work of Konrad Lorenz (1977), Donald\nCampbell (1974a, et al.), Karl Popper (1972, 1984) and Stephen Toulmin\n(1967, 1972). \n\nThe two programs have been labeled EEM and EET (Bradie, 1986). EEM is\nthe label for the program which attempts to provide an evolutionary\naccount of the development of cognitive structures. EET is the label\nfor the program which attempts to analyze the development of human\nknowledge and epistemological norms by appealing to relevant\nbiological considerations. Some of these attempts involve analyzing\nthe growth of human knowledge in terms of selectionist models and\nmetaphors (e.g., Popper 1972, Toulmin 1972, Hull 1988; see Renzi and\nNapolitano 2011 for a critique of these efforts). Others argue for a\nbiological grounding of epistemological norms and methodologies but\neschew selectionist models of the growth of human knowledge\nas such (e.g., Ruse 1986, Rescher 1990).\n\nThe EEM and EET programs are interconnected but distinct. A successful\nEEM selectionist explanation of the development of cognitive brain\nstructures provides no warrant, in itself, for extrapolating such\nmodels to understand the development of human knowledge systems.\nSimilarly, endorsing an EET selectionist account of how human\nknowledge systems grow does not, in itself, warrant concluding that\nspecific or general brain structures involved in cognition are the\nresult of natural selection for enhanced cognitive capacities. The two\nprograms, though similar in design and drawing upon the same models\nand metaphors, do not stand or fall together.\n",
