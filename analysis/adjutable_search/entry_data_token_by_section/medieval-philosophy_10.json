The\nmost obvious example is Dante\u2019s Divina Commedia, a\nstudy in Italian verse of love and moral conduct through an allegory\nof humans\u2019 post mortem destiny. Although without a university\neducation,\n Dante\n (who also wrote a highly original Latin treatise on politics) engages\nwith the great thirteenth-century thinkers\u2014Aquinas and his\nteacher, Albert the Great and, especially, the Arts Masters\u2014on\nequal terms and as an original thinker (Imbach 1996; De Libera,\nBrenet, & Rosier-Catach 2019).\n\nDante was working in a tradition that went back to Boethius\u2019s\nConsolation of Philosophy, a philosophical discussion using\npersonification and an elaborate prose and verse literary form. The\nConsolation was translated into almost every European\nvernacular; its influence mixed with that of twelfth-century Latin\nworks that looked back to it, such as Bernardus Silvestris\u2019s\nCosmographia (based also on the Timaeus) and Alain\nof Lille\u2019s Complaint of Nature. The first of the\nvernacular philosophical poems to draw on this heritage was the\ncontinuation in the 1270s of the Roman de la Rose by Jean de\nMeun, a lawyer who had close connections with the University of Paris\n(Morton & Nievergelt 2020). With both the Roman and the\nCommedia in mind, the late fourteenth-century English writers\nChaucer and Langland wrote philosophical poetry (Troilus and\nCriseyde, Piers Plowman) (Coleman 1981).\n\nMoreover, some highly educated philosophers writing mainly in Latin\nworked outside the universities.\n Ramon Llull\n (1232\u20131315/16) wrote prolifically in Catalan as well as Latin\nand reportedly also in Arabic, devising his own logical system,\nunrelated to university logic, for thinking about God and his\nattributes and demonstrating the truth of Christianity. In the\nfifteenth century, non-university philosophers included the Cardinal\nand papal diplomat\n Nicholas of Cusa\n (1401\u201364), courtier and papal secretary\n Lorenzo Valla\n (1407\u201357),\n Marsilio Ficino\n (1433\u201399), prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the Medici in Florence, and\nthe nobleman\n Pico della Mirandola\n (1463\u201394). They all developed their ideas in forms different\nfrom those common in the universities and held classical antiquity in\nhigh regard; Ficino was a noted Platonist\n (\u00a71.3.2),\n Pico aimed to find wisdom in every available source, from the Kabbala\nto \u2026 university\n theology.[21]\n\nWomen were excluded from most forms of higher education in the Middle\nAges, but there were opportunities, none the less, for them to study\nand engage in certain forms of philosophy. Some of those described as\n\u201cmystics\u201d (such as Hildegard of Bingen, Margaret Porete,\nMechthild of Magdeburg and others) engaged with philosophical\n issues.[22]\n And there was Christine de Pizan (1364\u2013c. 1430), a married\nwoman, educated by her father, astrologer to the King of France, who\nsupported her family by writing French poetry when her husband died.\nHer writing, at first lyrical verse, became philosophical, with\nBoethius but also Aquinas as points of reference, informed by a strong\nconsciousness both of the restrictions placed on women and of their\ncapabilities (K\u00f6nig-Pralong 2012).\n",
