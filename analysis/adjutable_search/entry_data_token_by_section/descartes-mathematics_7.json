Given its importance for\nunderstanding the program of La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie as\nwell as the attention this distinction has drawn from commentators, it\nis worth examining the proposals made in the opening pages of Book Two\nwith some care.\n\nDescartes begins with reference to the ancient classification of\nproblems and offers his interpretation of how ancient mathematicians\ndistinguished curves that could be used in the solution to geometrical\nproblems from those that could not:\n\n\nThe ancients were familiar with the fact that the problems of geometry\nmay be divided into three classes, namely, plane, solid, and linear\nproblems. This is equivalent to saying that some problems require only\ncircles and straight lines for their construction, while others\nrequire a conic section and still others more complex curves. I am\nsurprised, however, that they did not go further, and distinguish\nbetween different degrees of those more complex curves, nor do I see\nwhy they called the latter mechanical, rather than geometrical. If we\nsay that they are called mechanical because some sort of instrument\nhas to be used to describe them, then we must, to be consistent,\nreject circles and straight lines, since these cannot be described on\npaper without the use of compasses and a ruler, which may also be\ntermed instruments. It is not because the other instruments, being\nmore complicated than the ruler and compass, are therefore less\naccurate, for if this were so they would have to be excluded from\nmechanics, in which accuracy of construction is even more important\nthan in geometry. In the latter, exactness of reasoning alone is\nsought, and this can surely be as thorough with reference to such\nlines as to simpler ones (G, 40\u201344).\n\n\nDescartes implies that the terms \u201cmechanical\u201d and\n\u201cnon-geometrical\u201d were synonymous in ancient mathematics,\neven though it is not at altogether clear that this was the intended\nmeaning of the term \u201cmechanical.\u201d Namely, it is not clear,\ngiven the available textual evidence, that the classification of\ncurves into \u201cgeometrical\u201d and \u201cmechanical\u201d was\nintended to serve as a normative claim concerning the legitimacy of a\ncurve\u2019s use in geometrical problem-solving. It could just as\neasily be read as a descriptive moniker that captures the different\nways in which curves were constructed (see Molland 1976 on this issue;\nsee\n section 2.2\n above for Descartes\u2019 blending of the descriptive and the\nnormative in his 1619 proposal for a \u201cnew science\u201d of\ngeometry).\n\nDescartes\u2019 reading of the ancients aside, what\u2019s important\nfor understanding his own peculiar interpretation of geometrical\ncurves is the distinction he draws between the \u201caccuracy of\nconstruction\u201d of a curve, which he renders an issue for\nmechanics, and the \u201cexactness of reasoning,\u201d which he\ndeems as the sole requirement for accepting a curve as legitimately\ngeometrical. In making this claim, Descartes is carving out a unique\nplace for his notion of geometrical curves: He abandons the\n\u201caccuracy of construction\u201d criterion that Clavius adopted\nin his early works to render a curve acceptable in geometrical\nproblem-solving and also the claim forwarded by Vi\u00e8te that\ninstrumentally-constructed curves were not to be considered\ngeometrical (see\n section 1.1\n above). As Descartes\u2019 presentation implies, both these sorts of\ncriteria confuse issues of mechanics with the \u201cexactness of\nreasoning\u201d that is the sole concern of geometry. Thus, as Book\nTwo continues, Descartes reiterates that to determine the geometrical\nstatus of a curve we must lay our focus on issues of exact and clear\nreasoning and, specifically, on the question of whether a curve can be\nconstructed by exact and clear motions. After presenting the\npostulate that \u201ctwo or more lines can be moved, one upon the\nother, determining by their intersection other curves,\u201d\nDescartes explains,\n\n\nIt is true that the conic sections were never freely received into\nancient geometry, and I do not care to undertake to change names\nconfirmed by usage; nevertheless, it seems very clear to me that if we\nmake the usual assumption that geometry is precise and exact, while\nmechanics is not; and if we think of geometry as the science which\nfurnishes a general knowledge of the measurement of all bodies, then\nwe have no more right to exclude the more complex curves than the\nsimpler ones, provided they can be conceived of as described by a\ncontinuous motion or by several successive motions, each motion being\ncompletely determined by those which precede; for in this way an exact\nknowledge of the magnitude of each is always obtainable (G, 43).\n\n\nWe see in these remarks that the precision and exactness of geometry\nis intimately tied with the geometer\u2019s consideration of motions\nthat can be precisely and exactly traced. Namely, the geometer is\njustified in using simple curves as well as more complex curves, so\nlong as the construction of these curves proceeds by \u201cprecise\nand exact\u201d motions. Descartes clarifies how a complex curve\n\u201ccan be conceived of as described by a continuous motion or by\nseveral successive motions, each motion being completely determined by\nthose which precede\u201d by presenting the mesolabe compass that he\nfirst developed in 1619:\n\n\nConsider the lines AB, AD, AF, and so forth, which we may suppose to\nbe described by means of the instrument YZ\n [Figure 8].\n This instrument consists of several rulers hinged together in such a\nway that YZ being placed along the line AN the angle XYZ can be\nincreased or decreased in size, and when its sides are together, the\npoints B, C, D, E, F, G, H, all coincide with A; but as the size of\nthe angle is increased, the ruler BC, fastened at right angles to XY\nat the point B, pushed toward Z the ruler CD which slides along YZ\nalways at right angles. In a like manner, CD pushes DE which slides\nalong YX always parallel to BC; DE pushes EF; EF pushes FG; FG pushes\nGH, and so on. Thus we may imagine an infinity of rulers, each pushing\nanother, half of them making equal angles with YX and the rest with\nYZ.\n\nNow as the angle XYZ is increased, the point B describes the curve AB,\nwhich is a circle; while the intersections of the other rulers,\nnamely, the points D, F, H describe the other curves, AD, AF, AH, of\nwhich the latter are more complex than the first and this more complex\nthan the circle. Nevertheless I see no reason why the description of\nthe first cannot be conceived as clearly and distinctly as that of the\ncircle, or at least as that of the conic sections; or why that of the\nsecond, third, or any other that can be thus described, cannot be as\nclearly conceived of as the first: and therefore I see no reason why\nthey should not be used in the same way in the solution of geometric\nproblems (G,\n 44\u201347).[7]\n\n\n\nFigure 8. Mesolabe\n\n\nA couple points are worth emphasizing. First, Descartes presents the\nmore complex curves generated by his compass as described by motions\nthat can be as \u201cconceived as clearly and distinctly\u201d as\nthe motions required to construct the more simple circle. And because\nof the clear and distinct motions needed for their construction, these\ncurves are legitimately geometrical. That is, consistent with\nDescartes\u2019 general criterion for constructing geometrical\ncurves, these complex curves can be used in the solution of geometric\nproblems. Second, we see that although Descartes takes care to\ndistinguish the concerns of geometry from those of mechanics, he does\nnot steer away from the construction of curves by means of\ninstruments. Although instrumental constructions are mechanical\nconstructions, they can nonetheless give rise to geometrical curves\nprecisely because the motions of the instruments are\n\u201cclearly and distinctly\u201d conceived. That the motions are\ngenerated by instruments does not render the resultant curve\nnon-geometrical. (For more on the use of instruments in La\nG\u00e9om\u00e9trie, see Bos 1981.)\n\nIn a similar vein, curves that are non-geometrical by Descartes\u2019\nstandard are curves that require more complicated, less clear and\ndistinct motions for their construction. He explains:\n\n\nProbably the real explanation of the refusal of ancient geometers to\naccept curves more complex than the conic sections lies in the fact\nthat the first curves to which their attention was attracted happened\nto be the spiral, the quadratrix, and similar curves, which really do\nbelong only to mechanics, and are not among the curves that I think\nshould be included here, since they must be conceived of as described\nby two separate movements whose relation does not admit of exact\ndetermination (G, 44).\n\n\nDescartes explicitly names the spiral and quadratrix as those curves\nwhose construction \u201cmust be conceived of as described by two\nseparate movements whose relation does not admit of exact\ndetermination.\u201d Later in Book Two he clarifies why such\ndescriptions fail to be clearly and distinctly conceived:\n\n\ngeometry should not include lines that are like strings, in that they\nare sometimes straight and sometimes curved, since the ratios between\nstraight and curved lines are not known, and I believe cannot be\ndiscovered by human minds, and therefore no conclusion based upon such\nratios can be accepted as rigorous and exact (G, 91).\n\n\nGiven these remarks, the fundamental problem with the spiral, the\nquadratrix, and \u201clines that are like strings\u201d is that\ntheir construction requires consideration of the ratio, or relation,\nbetween a circle and straight line. Consider the spiral. As we saw\nabove, its construction involves two uniform motions, namely, the\nuniform rectilinear motion of a point along a segment and the uniform\ncircular motion of the segment around a point. These two motions must\nsimultaneously be considered in order for the moving point\u2019s\npath to describe the spiral, and this, for Descartes, is what is\nultimately problematic. The human mind can think about simultaneous\nrectilinear and circular motions, but it cannot do so with the clarity\nand distinctness required to meet the exact and rigorous standards of\ngeometry. (This claim is not without its problems, which will be\ndiscussed in\n section 3.3\n below. For a comparison between Descartes\u2019 criterion for the\nconstruction of geometrical curves and the views put forward by\nPascal, see Jesseph 2007.)\n\nAfter presenting his construction criterion for geometrical curves,\nDescartes develops his novel connection between geometrical\nconstruction and the algebraic representation of these curves. Whereas\nin Book One Descartes details how to use algebra to establish that a\nsolution a geometrical problem exists, here, in Book Two, Descartes\nproposes a stronger connection between algebra and geometry and\nfamously claims that any legitimately geometrical curve can be\nrepresented by an equation:\n\n\nI could give here several other ways of tracing and conceiving a\nseries of curved lines, each curve more complex than any preceding\none, but I think the best way to group together all such curves and\nthen classify them in order, is by recognizing the fact that all the\npoints of those curves which we may call \u201cgeometric,\u201d that\nis, those which admit of precise and exact measurement, must bear a\ndefinite relation to all points of a straight line, and that this\nrelation must be expressed means of a single equation (G, 48).\n\n\nHe then proceeds to classify these \u201cgeometric\u201d curves\naccording to the degree of their corresponding equations,\nclaiming:\n\n\nIf [a curve\u2019s] equation contains no term of higher degree than\nthe rectangle [product] of two unknown quantities, or the square of\none, the curve belongs to the first and simplest class, which contains\nonly the circle, the parabola, the hyperbola, and the ellipse; but\nwhen the equation contains one or more terms of the third or fourth\ndegree, in one or both of the two unknown quantities (for it requires\ntwo unknown quantities to express the relation between two points) the\ncurve belongs to the second class; and if the equation contains a term\nof the fifth or sixth degree in either or both of the unknown\nquantities the curve belongs to the third class, and so on\nindefinitely (G, 48).\n\n\nThe same point is made later in Book Two, where Descartes emphasizes\nthat \u201cno matter how we conceive a curve to be described,\nprovided it be one of those which I have called geometric,\u201d it\nwill always be possible to find an equation determining all of the\ncurve\u2019s points (G, 56). He reiterates that geometric curves can\nbe classified according to their equations but also points out that\nwithin a specific class, a curves\u2019 simplicity should be ranked\naccording to the motions required for construction. For instance,\nalthough the circle belongs to the same class as the ellipse,\nhyperbola, and parabola, these latter curves are \u201cequally\ncomplex\u201d whereas the circle \u201cis evidently a simpler\ncurve\u201d and will thus be more useful in the construction of\nproblems (G, 56). (See Manders 2008, 77, for discussion of\nLeibniz\u2019s and Poncelet\u2019s dissatisfaction with the\nconnection between the algebraic form that Descartes uses to represent\ngeometrical curves and the spatial, diagrammatic representation of\nthese curves.)\n\nAs in Book One, Descartes uses the Pappus Problem to illustrate the\npower of his geometrical calculus, where in Book Two, his aim is to\nshow how his algebraic classification of curves makes it easy\n\u201cto demonstrate the solution which [he has] already given of the\nproblem of Pappus\u201d (G, 59). The specific goal here is to\nestablish that the curves which solve the general Pappus Problem are\nlegitimately geometrical curves, i.e., to show that the Pappus curves\nmeet the exact and rigorous standards of geometrical construction that\nhe has just laid out. Descartes\u2019 discussion of the Pappus\nProblem in Book Two begins as follows:\n\n\nHaving now made a general classification of curves, it is easy for me\nto demonstrate the solution which I have already given of the problem\nof Pappus. For, first, I have shown [in Book One] that when there are\nonly three or four lines the equation which serves to determine the\nrequired points is of the second degree. It follows that the curve\ncontaining these points [i.e., the Pappus curve] must belong to the\nfirst class, since such an equation expresses the relation between all\npoints of curves of Class I and all points of a fixed straight line.\nWhen there are not more than eight given lines the equation is at most\na biquadratic, and therefore the resulting [Pappus] curve belongs to\nClass II or Class I. When there are not more than twelve given lines,\nthe equation is of the sixth degree or lower, and therefore the\nrequired curve belongs to Class III or a lower class, and so on for\nother cases (G, 59).\n\n\nAs indicated in the passage above, Descartes establishes in Book Two\nthat Pappus curves fall into the specified classes of geometric curves\nhe has designated, where the class into which a Pappus curve falls\ndepends on the number of lines given in the problem and thus, on the\ndegree of the equation to which the problem is reduced. For instance,\nwhen Descartes treats the four-line Pappus Problem in Book Two, he\nshows that, by varying the coefficients of the second degree equation\nto which the problem has been reduced (through the analysis of Book\nOne), we can construct either a circle, parabola, hyperbola, or\nellipse (G, 59\u201380). That is, he shows that the Pappus curve that\nsolves the four-line problem is either a circle or one of the conic\nsections, the very \u201cgeometric\u201d curves that he has grouped\ninto Class I.\n",
