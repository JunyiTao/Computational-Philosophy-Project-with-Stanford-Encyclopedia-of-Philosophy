    "main_text": "Philosophical Theology || The Existence of God\n7.1 The Existence of God\n7.1.1 The Ontological Argument\n\n\nLeibniz made an important contribution to the history of the\nontological argument. His reflections on this form of argument go back\nto the 1670s, and we know that he shared his thoughts on this matter\nwith Spinoza when Leibniz visited him on the way to Hanover. According\nto Leibniz, the argument that Descartes gives implicitly in the Fifth\nMeditation and explicitly in the First Set of Replies is\nfaulty. Descartes had argued that God is a being having all\nperfections, existence is a perfection, therefore, God exists. (AT VII\n118\u201319/CSM II 84\u201385) But, Leibniz thinks, one needs to show that it is\npossible for such a being to exist, that is, that it is\npossible for all perfections to co-exist in one being. If this is so,\nthen and only then an ens perfectissimum can be said to exist.\nIn his short essay That a Most Perfect Being Exists\n(Quod ens perfectissimum existit) from 1676, Leibniz\nargues just this. He defines a \u201cperfection\u201d as a\n\u201csimple quality which is positive and absolute, or, which\nexpresses without any limits whatever it does express\u201d (A VI iii\n578/SR 101). And with this definition in hand, Leibniz is then able to\nclaim that there can be no inconsistency among perfections, since a\nperfection, in being simple and positive, is unanalyzable and incapable\nof being enclosed by limits. That is, if A and B are perfections, then\nthe proposition \u201cA and B are incompatible\u201d cannot be\ndemonstrated because A and B are simples, nor can the proposition be\nknown per se. Therefore, it is possible that any and all perfections\nare in fact compatible. And, therefore, Leibniz reasons, a subject of\nall perfections, or an ens perfectissimum, is indeed\npossible.\n\n\nBut this argument by itself is not sufficient to determine that God\nnecessarily exists. Leibniz must also show that existence is itself a\nperfection, so that a being having all perfections, an ens\nperfectissimum, may be said to exist. More exactly, Leibniz needs\nto show that necessary existence belongs to the essence of\nGod. And this he does in another short piece from this period, writing\n\u201cAgain, a necessary being is the same as a being from whose\nessence existence follows. For a necessary being is one which\nnecessarily exists, such that for it not to exist would imply a\ncontradiction, and so would conflict with the concept or essence of\nthis being\u201d (A VI iii 583/SR 107). In other words, if it is the\ncase that a necessary being is the same thing as a being whose\nexistence follows from its essence, then existence must in fact be one\nof its essential properties. Leibniz continues in this short\nreflection, \u201cAnd so existence belongs to its concept or essence.\nFrom this we have a splendid theorem, which is the pinnacle of modal\ntheory and by which one moves in a wonderful way from potentiality to\nact: If a necessary being is possible, it follows that it exists\nactually, or, that such a being is actually found in the\nuniverse\u201d (A VI iii 583/SR 107). The \u201cpinnacle of Modal\nTheory\u201d that Leibniz mentions here is none other than one of the\nnotorious axioms of the modal logic S5:\n\u25ca\u25a1p \u2192 \u25a1p. In short,\nLeibniz's argument is the following:\n\n\n\n(1)\nGod is a being having all perfections. (Definition)\n\n\n(2)\nA perfection is a simple and absolute property. (Definition)\n\n\n(3)\nExistence is a perfection.\n\n\n(4)\nIf existence is part of the essence of a thing, then\nit is a necessary being.\n\n\n(5)\nIf it is possible for a necessary being to exist,\nthen a necessary being does exist.\n\n\n(6)\nIt is possible for a being to have all\nperfections.\n\n\n(7)\nTherefore, a necessary being (God) does exist.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that Leibniz's argument bears a certain\naffinity with the ontological argument that G\u00f6del gives, insofar\nas it also seeks to demonstrate the possibility of a being having all\nsimple, positive properties. (For G\u00f6del's argument, see the\n entry on  \n ontological arguments.)\n7.1.2 The Cosmological Argument\n\n\nAs we have seen, the Principle of Sufficient Reason is one of the\nbedrock principles of all of Leibniz's philosophy. In the\nMonadology, Leibniz appeals to PSR, saying that even in the\ncase of contingent truths or truths of fact there must be a sufficient\nreason why they are so and not otherwise. (Monadology\n\u00a736) But, since each particular truth of fact is contingent upon\nsome other (prior) truth of fact, the reason for the entire series of\ntruths must be located outside the series, and this ultimate reason is\nwhat we call God. (Monadology \u00a737)\n\n\nIn the Theodicy, Leibniz fills out this argument with a\nfascinating account of the nature of God. First, insofar as the first\ncause of the entire series must have been able to survey all other\npossible worlds, it has understanding. Second, insofar as it was able\nto select one world among the infinity of possible worlds, it has a\nwill. Third, insofar as it was able to bring about this world, it has\npower. (Leibniz adds here that \u201cpower relates to being,\nwisdom or understanding to truth, and will to\ngood.\u201d) Fourth, insofar as the first cause relates to\nall possibles, its understanding, will and power are infinite. And,\nfifth, insofar as everything is connected together, there is no reason\nto suppose more than one God. Thus, Leibniz is able to\ndemonstrate the uniqueness of God, his omniscience,\nomnipotence, and benevolence from the twin assumptions of the\ncontingency of the world and the Principle of Sufficient Reason.\n(Theodicy \u00a77: G VI 106\u201307/H 127\u201328)\nNaturally, if one were deny the existence of possible worlds in the\nsense conceived by Leibniz or deny PSR (by, say, admitting\n\u201cbrute facts\u201d), then one would hardly be moved by this\nkind of argument.\n",
