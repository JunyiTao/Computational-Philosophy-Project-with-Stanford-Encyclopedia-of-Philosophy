    "main_text": "Mohist Views on Logic and Language || The Mohist Linguistic Turn\n3.4 The Mohist Linguistic Turn\n\nThe Mohist program was beset with two basic kinds of problems. First,\nin the domain of reference, the Mohists encountered difficulties in\ntheir method of \u201cextending kinds\u201d. This was the problem of\nidentifying appropriate salience conditions in perception and thought\nto serve as criteria for naming the similar similarly and the\ndifferent differently. Second, in the domain of meaning, they faced\nunexpected questions in their evaluations of the meanings of names in\ncomplex expressions, suggesting problems in extending their theory of\nreference from simple terms to complex expressions on the assumption\nthat the latter are to be treated compositionally. One can see how the\nMohists\u2019 preference for reasoning by analogy, and the problems\nbeleaguering their quest for certainty, would have encouraged them to\nadopt the same orientation with respect to the study of language\nitself, its grammatical forms and their implications for meaning. They\nturned their attention to the study of language in hopes that more\nsophisticated analyses of meaning would help resolve some of the\nproblems afflicting their account of reference. But one would also\nexpect the Mohists to remain apprehensive here about making general\nstatements, just as they found was necessary in their analysis of\nreference, and this is exactly what we find in the later writings of\nthe Canons, particularly in the Lesser Selection\n(Xiao Qu), the compilation most noteworthy for its novel\ninsights in the study of language.\n\nOn the surface, the Mohist program for language is to put together an\ninventory of parallel linguistic constructions with the expectation\nthat the logic implicated in their meanings will at least partly track\ntheir grammatical form. But the Mohists\u2019 recognition that\njudgments about resemblance involve uncertainty convinced them that\nany method of disputation based on analogies in grammatical form is\nnot inherently reliable. They explain:\n\n\nThings have respects in which they are similar, yet it doesn\u2019t\nfollow that they are completely similar. Parallels between expressions\nare correct only up to a point. When things are \u201cso\u201d,\nthere is that by which they are \u201cso\u201d. Their being\n\u201cso\u201d is the same, but that by which they are\n\u201cso\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily the same. When people accept\nthings, there is that by which they accept them. Their accepting them\nis the same, but that by which they accept them isn\u2019t\nnecessarily the same. Hence, expressions in analogies, parallelizing,\n\u201cpulling\u201d, and \u201cpushing\u201d become different as\nthey proceed, become dangerous as they change direction, fail when\ntaken too far, and separate from their root as they flow, and so one\ncannot be careless and cannot invariably use them. Thus statements\nhave many methods, separate kinds of different reasons, and so one\ncannot look at only one side. (Lesser Selection [Xiao\nQu])\n\n\nThe Mohists are crisscrossing here between reference and meaning,\nbetween the problems they observe in their analogical theory of naming\nand those they now identify in their theory of linguistic parallels.\nPresumably, the Mohist expression \u201cbeing so\u201d\n(ran) is a reference to \u201cbeing of a certain\nkind\u201d, and \u201cthat which makes it so\u201d refers to the\nconditions under which a thing is admissibly considered to be of that\nkind. Recall the Mohist observation that objects may resemble one\nanother but not be of the same kind, because they do not resemble one\nanother \u201cin the appropriate way\u201d. Here the Mohists appear\nto be making the correlative point that two objects may be of the same\nkind (\u201ctheir being \u2018so\u2019 is the same\u201d), while\nthe conditions that warrant their being treated as of the same kind\nare not necessarily the same. In the domain of meaning, the Mohists\nare making the same point: expressions in language may have the same\ngrammatical form, but the conditions by which they are admissibly\napplied might be different.\n\nThe passage quoted above makes a passing reference to four techniques\nof disputation commonly recognized by the Mohists and their\ninterlocutors. The four techniques are listed explicitly in the\nLesser Selection with explanations:\n\n\nAnalogy (pi): \u201cBringing up other things and using them\nto clarify it\u201d\n\nParallelizing (mou): \u201cComparing expressions and jointly\nproceeding\u201d\n\nPulling (yuan): \u201cSaying, \u2018You are so. How is it\nthat I alone cannot be so?\u2019\u201d\n\nPushing (tui): \u201cOn the grounds that what they\ndon\u2019t accept is the same as what they do accept, propose\nit\u201d.\n\n\nThere is a great deal of controversy surrounding how these techniques\nare to be understood and what their relationship is. It has been\nargued that they comprise the steps of a single, complex inference\nprocedure in which a claim is established. However, this view is\ndifficult to justify because it requires supporting the claim that\neach step is somehow necessary, serving as an essential premise for\nthe next. An easier and more commonly accepted view is that each\ntechnique may operate independently to establish a point. Yang (2020)\nargues that each serves to make an inference in its own right: the\nfirst two are used to infer in each case that a proposition is true,\nwhile the second two are used to infer in each case that a proposition\nis false. By contrast, Robins (2010) argues that each is an instance\nof the general method of reasoning by analogy that was common\nthroughout most of early Chinese thought. The Mohists are clarifying\nfour different ways in which this general method might be\ninstantiated. The first two cover the domains of reference and\nmeaning, as distinguished above. Analogy (pi) indicates the\nmethod of extending kinds, employing models of comparison in\nperception or thought by acts of reference to identify or explain what\nsomething is. Parallelizing (mou) is the Mohist extension of\nthis idea into the world of linguistic forms. \u201cPushing\u201d\nand \u201cpulling\u201d hint at the pragmatic circumstances in\ndisputation in which one attempts to establish a claim on the basis of\nits analogy with claims the other side has already accepted.\n\nHere we concentrate on the technique of parallelizing, arguably the\nMohists\u2019 most original contribution to early Chinese thought on\ndisputation and logic. (For further discussion, see Yang 2020, Robins\n2010 and 2012, and the entry\n Mohist Canons.)\n As their explanation suggests (\u201ccomparing expressions and\njointly proceeding\u201d, bi ci er ju xing), the Mohists\ntreat parallelizing as a technique in which linguistic models of a\ncertain grammatical form are utilized to make a comparative point\nabout some other linguistic construction that is in doubt. For\ninstance, the following statements have similar grammatical form:\n\n\nWhite horses are horses; riding white horses is riding horses.\n\nBlack horses are horses; riding black horses is riding horses.\n\nJack is a person; loving Jack is loving a person.\n\nJill is a person; loving Jill is loving a person.\n\n\nEach is a model that instantiates a common linguistic form. The\nMohists do not give a symbolic representation of this form, but we can\nassume its recognition as a general kind in virtue of the parallelism\nin structure that the models collectively exhibit. Technically, each\nstatement is a conjunction of two simpler statements (with no obvious\nconditional relationship indicated, which is sometimes assumed). So\nthe general form seems to be:\n\n(Form A)\n(A is B) & (VA is\nVB),\n\n\nwhere V is a verb combined with the noun phrases A\nand B to yield, in effect, two distinct nominalized\ninfinitives. We call this \u201cForm A\u201d to represent a general\nkind, a kind of linguistic form commonly recognized in its instances.\nOn the other hand, they are aware that instances of this form may fail\nas well. For example:\n\n\nRobbers are people, [but] being without robbers is not being without\npeople.\n\nRobbers are people, [but] desiring to be without robbers is not\ndesiring to be without people.\n\n\nThe Mohists put these latter examples in a different class, which we\nmay identify as:\n\n(Form B)\n(A is B) & (VA is not\nVB)\n\n\nThe Mohist technique of parallelizing seeks to establish some other\nclaim that might be doubted on the basis of its analogy with the\nproposed models. Consider the following statement constructed from the\nnominals \u201cboat\u201d and \u201cwood\u201d, and the verb\n\u201center\u201d:\n\nA boat is wood, [but] entering a boat is not entering wood.\n\nThe Mohists treat this statement as admissible, thus classifying it\nunder the general kind associated with\n Form B.\n This is \u201ccomparing expressions and jointly proceeding\u201d,\nbut the Mohists\u2019 increasing sensitivity to semantic nuances led\nthem to admonish caution about drawing inferences merely on the basis\nof form. Some inferences \u201cproceed\u201d, others don\u2019t,\nregardless of obvious parallelisms. As a result, they appropriated\nindividual cases in one way or another depending on how the semantics\nof their terms played out in combination. On the other hand, this\ncareful attention to individual cases led them to a discovery of\nintensional contexts, arguably the most original contribution of the\nMohists\u2019 studies of language.\n",
