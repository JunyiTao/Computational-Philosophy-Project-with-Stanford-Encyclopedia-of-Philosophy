    "main_text": "Robert Boyle\n4. Robert Boyle\n\nRobert Boyle\u2019s variant belongs more to philosophy of science\nthan theory of perception. It is integral to the corpuscular theory\n(hereafter \u201cCT\u201d), the mechanist natural philosophy he\npromotes. He is an avid experimentalist and prolific author of works\non ethics, theology, natural religion, and both alchemical and\nmechanist natural philosophy (Stewart 1991: xi\u2013xii,\nxv\u2013xvi; Anstey 2000: 9). Boyle strongly opposes any intrusion of\nmetaphysical and logical entities in natural philosophy (Boyle 1666\n[1991: 3, 8, 22, 28]; Stewart 1991: xiii). The targets are\nSuarez\u2019s real qualities and scholastic accidental and\nsubstantial forms. The former, as Boyle understands them, are entities\nthat naturally inhere in material substance but have independent\ncausal powers (see Boyle 1666 [1991: 21\u20132]). Boyle avoids\ncontroversial metaphysical doctrines that divide mechanists, such as\nEpicurean atomism, innate motion, Cartesian essences and the endless\nactual separation of parts of bodies (1666 [1991: 7\u20138]).\nAccording to CT, observable bodies are composed of very small\nrelatively stable corpuscles, composed of minima naturales\nwith tightly cohering parts rarely separated in nature (Anstey 2000:\n10\u201311, 43\u20134).\n\nBoyle\u2019s best known work in natural philosophy is The Origin\nof Forms and Qualities According to the Corpuscular Philosophy\n(1666) (hereafter \u201cOFQ\u201d). A large part of OFQ is devoted\nto reports of experiments intended to show the superiority of CT over\nits scholastic and chemical competitors (OFQ [1991: 18]; also Boyle\n1674). According to the theoretical part, matter is one extended\nimpenetrable substance to which motion in accord with contingent laws\nis added by God. Local motion, the \u201cgrand agent\u201d of\nnatural change (OFQ [1991: 19]), divides matter into parts, each\nmodified by a determinate size, shape, and local motion. The\ncorresponding determinable modifications are inseparable from every\npart of matter, and designated \u201cprimary\u201d because they are\nsimple, primitive, and sufficient to derive all qualities (OFQ [1991:\n97]). Texture, a fourth primary modification, is the configuration,\ni.e., mutual orientation and order, of the corpuscular parts of a body\n(OFQ [1991: 30]). Texture is composed of the primary affections of\nmany insensible particles which jointly form a novel modification that\nnone of the particles has by itself, much as TINs do for Descartes.\nAll four primary affections are intrinsic properties. Boyle calls them\n\u201cmechanical affections\u201d (hereafter \u201cMAs\u201d)\nbecause, he says, the operations of machines are commonly explained by\nthem (OFQ [1991: 18\u201321]). The stated aim of OFQ is\n\n\nto make it probable by experiment \u2026 that almost all sorts of\nqualities \u2026 may be produced \u2026 by corporeal agents\n\u2026 that work [only] by virtue of motion, size, figure, and\ncontrivance of their own parts. (OFQ [1991: 17])\n\n\nQualities are entities of a different type: causal capacities and, for\nthe most part, relations between two bodies (OFQ [1991: 13,\n23\u201330]). The terms \u201cquality\u201d and \u201cpower\u201d\nare treated as synonyms. The quality-making relation is not fully\nexplicit. A relation of congruence, or fit, between the MAs of the two\nbodies is often mentioned; spatial temporal co-incidence is implicit;\nconnections with other things in the environs are suggested\n(O\u2019Toole 1974; Kaufman 2006: 166\u2013173). The relational\ntheory is motivated by arguments of two sorts (OFQ [1991:\n23\u201330]). One is illustrated by the legend that the first lock\nwas forged without a key; Boyle argues that when a piece of metal of a\ncertain size and shape was subsequently made, the lock acquired the\npower to be worked; so the power to be worked and the power to work\nare relations between the key and the lock; but in the bodies\nthemselves there is nothing distinct from their sizes, figures,\nmotions and those of their parts. The second is an argument from\nparsimony. If every new quality a body acquired added something to the\nbody itself, it would contain a vast number distinct entities that\nserve no physical purpose.\n\nAnstey (2000: 52) maintains that qualities have a reductive structure:\nMAs are not powers and qualities, which are powers, are reduced to\ntheir respective MAs. The quality is, then, explained by its\nconstituents: the congruent mechanical affections of a pair of bodies\nexplain what happens when one is duly applied to the other in terms\nthat are intelligible and familiar from our understanding of machines.\nBoyle repeatedly claims that in the bodies that constitute qualities,\nthere is nothing distinct from their MAs, but often remarks that\nqualities derive from or depend upon the MAs of bodies. Anstey is one\nof several scholars who find a tension between these two claims. The\nworry is that \u201cnothing distinct from\u201d expresses\nontological reduction; that the dependence in view is asymmetric; and\na thing cannot have an asymmetric relation to itself.\n\nThe tension is at the center of one of the two main scholarly\ndisagreements about Boyle\u2019s theory of qualities. The other\nquestions whether he consistently adheres to the relational theory or\nretreats to a monadic notion of dispositive qualities in some\npassages.\n",
