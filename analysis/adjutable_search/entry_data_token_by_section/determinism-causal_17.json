    "main_text": "Chance and Determinism\n5. Chance and Determinism\n\nSome philosophers maintain that if determinism holds in our world,\nthen there are no objective chances in our world. And often\nthe word \u2018chance\u2019 here is taken to be synonymous with\n\u2018probability\u2019, so these philosophers maintain that there\nare no non-trivial objective probabilities for events in our world.\n(The caveat \u201cnon-trivial\u201d is added here because on some\naccounts, under determinism, all future events that actually happen\nhave probability, conditional on past history, equal to 1, and future\nevents that do not happen have probability equal to zero. Non-trivial\nprobabilities are probabilities strictly between zero and one.)\nConversely, it is often held, if there are laws of nature that are\nirreducibly probabilistic, determinism must be false. (Some\nphilosophers would go on to add that such irreducibly probabilistic\nlaws are the basis of whatever genuine objective chances obtain in our\nworld.)\n\nThe discussion of quantum mechanics in section 4 shows that it may be\ndifficult to know whether a physical theory postulates genuinely\nirreducible probabilistic laws or not. If a Bohmian version of QM is\ncorrect, then the probabilities dictated by the Born rule are not\nirreducible. If that is the case, should we say that the probabilities\ndictated by quantum mechanics are not objective? Or should we say that\nwe need to distinguish \u2018chance\u2019 and\n\u2018probability\u2019 after all\u2014and hold that not all\nobjective probabilities should be thought of as objective\nchances? The first option may seem hard to swallow, given the\nmany-decimal-place accuracy with which such probability-based\nquantities as half-lives and cross-sections can be reliably predicted\nand verified experimentally with QM.\n\nWhether objective chance and determinism are really incompatible or\nnot may depend on what view of the nature of laws is adopted. On a\n\u201cpushy explainers\u201d view of laws such as that\ndefended by Maudlin (2007), probabilistic laws are interpreted as\nirreducible dynamical transition-chances between allowed physical\nstates, and the incompatibility of such laws with determinism is\nimmediate. But what should a defender of a Humean view of laws, such\nas the BSA theory (section 2.4 above), say about probabilistic laws?\nThe first thing that needs to be done is explain how probabilistic\nlaws can fit into the BSA account at all, and this requires\nmodification or expansion of the view, since as first presented the\nonly candidates for laws of nature are true universal generalizations.\nIf \u2018probability\u2019 were a univocal, clearly understood\nnotion then this might be simple: We allow universal generalizations\nwhose logical form is something like: \u201cWhenever conditions\nY obtain, Pr(A) = x\u201d. But it is not\nat all clear how the meaning of \u2018Pr\u2019 should be understood\nin such a generalization; and it is even less clear what features the\nHumean pattern of actual events must have, for such a generalization\nto be held true. (See the entry on\n interpretations of probability\n and Lewis (1994).)\n\nHumeans about laws believe that what laws there are is a matter of\nwhat patterns are there to be discerned in the overall mosaic of\nevents that happen in the history of the world. It seems plausible\nenough that the patterns to be discerned may include not only strict\nassociations (whenever X, Y), but also stable\nstatistical associations. If the laws of nature can include either\nsort of association, a natural question to ask seems to be: why\ncan\u2019t there be non-probabilistic laws strong enough to ensure\ndeterminism, and on top of them, probabilistic laws as well? If a\nHumean wanted to capture the laws not only of fundamental theories,\nbut also non-fundamental branches of physics such as (classical)\nstatistical mechanics, such a peaceful coexistence of deterministic\nlaws plus further probabilistic laws would seem to be desirable.\nLoewer (2004), Frigg & Hoefer (2015) and Hoefer (2019) offer forms\nof this peaceful coexistence that can be achieved within a Humean\naccount of laws.\n\n",
