Business activity raises a host of interesting philosophical\nissues: of agency, responsibility, truth, manipulation, exploitation,\njustice, beneficence, and more. After a surge of activity 40 years\nago, however, philosophers seem to be gradually retreating from the\nfield.\n\nOne explanation appeals to demand. Many of the philosophers who\ndeveloped the field were hired into business schools, but after they\nretired, they were not replaced with other philosophers. Business\nschools have hired psychologists to understand why people engage in\nunethical behavior and strategists to explore whether ethics pays.\nThese scholars fit better into the business school environment, which\nis dominated by social scientists. What social scientists do to\nadvance our understanding of descriptive ethics is important, to be\nsure, but it is no substitute for normative reflection on what\nis ethical or unethical in business.\n\nAnother explanation for the retreat of philosophers from business\nethics appeals to supply. There are hardly any philosophy Ph.D.\nprograms that have faculty specializing in business ethics and, as a\nresult, few new Ph.D.\u2019s are produced in this area. Those who\nwork in the area are typically \u201cconverts\u201d from mainstream\nethical theory and political philosophy. Some good news on this front\nis the recent increase in the number of normative theorists working on\nissues at the intersection of philosophy, politics, and economics\n(PPE). Many of the topics these scholars address\u2014the value and\nlimits of markets, the nature of the employment relationship, and the\nrole of government in regulating commerce\u2014are issues business\nethicists care about. But PPE-style philosophers hardly cover the\nwhole field of business ethics. There remain many urgent issues to\naddress.\n\nI hope this entry helps to inform philosophers and others about the\nrichness and value of business ethics, and in doing so, generate\ngreater interest in the field.\n",
