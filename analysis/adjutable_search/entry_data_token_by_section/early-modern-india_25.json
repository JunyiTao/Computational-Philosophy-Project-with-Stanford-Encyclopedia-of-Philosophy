It would\ntypically be expressed by a sentence such as \u201cwherever there is\nsmoke there is fire\u201d, or \u201cwhatever exists is\ntransitory\u201d. Knowledge of this relation, according to the\nNy\u0101ya, is the instrumental cause in the inferential\nprocess\u2014it is that relation knowledge of which, when combined\nwith observation of the inferential sign, will permit us to make a\nsound or knowledge-yielding inference. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba therefore\nattaches great importance to the precise definition of this relation.\nHe notes as many as twenty-one definitions all of which he rejects for\nsome reason or other, and then he goes on to give seven further\nformulations, each of which he considers acceptable. Of the\ndefinitions he rejects, the first five came to be known as the\n\u2018vy\u0101pti-pa\u00f1caka\u2019, and inspired a huge\nliterature both among the Sanskrit commentators and their modern\ninterpreters. These definitions are traceable to the earlier Buddhist\nand Ny\u0101ya literature. Two more rejected definitions, known as the\n\u2018Lion and Tiger\u2019 definitions, are apparently due to\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s Navya-Ny\u0101ya predecessors (Wada 2007,\nch. 5). The definition Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba finally accepts is called\nhis \u2018siddh\u0101nta-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a\u2019.\n",
