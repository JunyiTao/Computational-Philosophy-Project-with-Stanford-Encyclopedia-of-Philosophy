    "main_text": "Life and works || Reception of Sturm in Leibniz and Wolff\n1.2 Reception of Sturm in Leibniz and Wolff\n\nToday, Sturm is most commonly remembered as the polemical target of\nLeibniz\u2019s essay De Ipsa Natura (1698), which is part of\nan articulated controversy between Sturm and Leibniz on whether nature\ncan be considered endowed with active principles (a claim denied by\nSturm and defended by Leibniz). In fact, Leibniz and Sturm knew of one\nanother, since they were both students of Erhard Weigel (Lemanski\n2018). Presumably, they met in the 1660s, maybe when Leibniz was at\nAltdorf University in 1666 or when he was the secretary of the\nalchemical society in Nuremberg in 1667 (for Leibniz life, see Arthur\n2014: x\u2013xvi).\n\nIn his De Ipsa Natura, Leibniz presents Sturm as a supporter\nof Malebranche\u2019s occasionalism. This charge is partially correct\ninsofar as Sturm does claim, like Malebranche, that God is the only\nactive cause operating in nature. However, Leibniz oversimplifies\nSturm\u2019s position. Sturm\u2019s account of passive forms is in\nfact different from Malebranche\u2019s occasionalism for the role\nthat it attributes to finite forms in the explanation of natural\nphenomena and for the relatively minor role that the notion of the\nlaws of nature plays in Sturm\u2019s account (see\n sect. 3).\n More generally, Sturm\u2019s project is diametrically opposed to\nLeibniz\u2019s. At the core of Leibniz\u2019s criticisms is his\ncommitment to the traditional scholastic view that the notions of\nsubstance and action are deeply interconnected (e.g. Leibniz 1989,\n160). The commitment to the notion of action as the fundamental ground\nto think about the very nature of substances underpins Leibniz\u2019s\nmain objections to Sturm\u2019s account of the passivity of\nforms. Leibniz cannot accept that any natural being could ever be\nadequately conceived, or taken to have any ontological consistency,\nwithout referring to some kind of activity. However, Sturm rejects\nprecisely Leibniz\u2019s fundamental commitment to activity as the\nontological ground of substances. As a result, Sturm hardly offers\nLeibniz any answer that would be satisfying from the latter\u2019s\npoint of view.\n\nThe clash of fundamental philosophical intuitions that surfaces in the\nexchange between Leibniz and Sturm is particularly interesting with\nregard to the complex evolution of early modern philosophy across the\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries (Sangiacomo 2020a and 2020b). In\na sense, Leibniz voices the main objection that can be raised against\nSturm; namely, without some active principle \u201cmechanical\nforms\u201d are just idle constructions that cannot perform any\ngenuine explanatory role.  However, Sturm\u2019s consistent way of\nmaintaining that explanation does not require any reference\nto intrinsic causal powers points, in fact, to an alternative account\nof causation and causal explanations altogether, which was emerging at\nthe time (Carraud 2002; Sangiacomo 2019, 2020c).\n\nDespite Leibniz opposing Sturm\u2019s metaphysics and natural\nphilosophy, he was appreciative of and influenced by Sturm\u2019s\n(and Weigel\u2019s) developments in logic (Lemanski 2018).\nFurthermore, Leibniz\u2019s major disciple in Germany, Christian\nWolff, was very much fond of Sturm himself. So much so that it was\nWolff who supported the publication of the pars specialis of\nSturm\u2019s PE and provided a preface to it. Wolff was probably\nfamiliar with Sturm due to Wolff\u2019s former teacher, Georg\nAlbrecht Hamberger, who in turn had studied with Sturm (Gaab, in Gaab\net al. 2004: 48f).\n\nIn his preface, Wolff is full of praise for Sturm, especially because\nhe believes to find in Sturm\u2019s method an anticipation of his own\ntripartite division of knowledge into historical knowledge or\nknowledge of facts, philosophical knowledge or knowledge of causes,\nand mathematical knowledge or knowledge of the quantities of things\nput down in the first chapter of the Philosophia Rationalis\n(see\n SEP entry on Christian Wolff,\n sects. 3 and 7). However, Wolff is aware that mathematical\nquantification does not figure in Sturm\u2019s method as prominently\nas the other two types of knowledge. Besides, Wolff compliments Sturm\nfor establishing experimental teaching (collegia) \u2014 an\nacademic novelty. Moreover, he looks very favorably on Sturm\u2019s\nthree physics, praising Sturm\u2019s scientific method\n (sect. 2),\n and pointing out the very positive reception of the first part of the\nPE. He laments the absence of a third part (the pars\nspecialissima) of the PE, which was supposed to deal with living\nbeings. Sturm\u2019s death prevented its termination and successive\npublication. However, in order to close this gap, Wolff directs the\nreader to the lecture of Honor\u00e9 Fabri\u2019s works on plants,\nanimals and human beings. Indeed, Sturm himself had allegedly\nrecommended to the editor to join Fabri\u2019s writings on these\nmatters with the two completed parts of the PE to provide a complete\nphysics. Besides Fabri, in the preliminaries, Wolff directs the reader\nto the works of Gassendi, Clauberg, Du Hamel, La Forge, Cordemoy,\nHarvey, Perrault, Malpighi, Grew, and Ray to obtain knowledge about\nplants, animals, and especially the connection of the mind and the\nbody in the human case.\n",
