    "main_text": "Religious Views || Miracles\n2.2 Miracles\n\nBoyle was aware that most believers held their belief on insufficient\ngrounds (see BP 4:60, BOA \u00a73.7.5, pp. 301\u20132), but felt\nhimself fortunate in that sound philosophy showed that the religion to\nwhich he was born was the correct one. For Boyle, miracles (in\nparticular the miracle of Pentecost) were a crucial factor in opting\nfor Christianity. The Christian miracles, he felt, clearly bore the\nstamp of God upon them. There were, he agreed, other miracles or\napparent miracles, but the miracles which purported to establish\nChristianity were neither false nor diabolical, and they were\nmiraculous. Locke believed that \u201cMahomet having none to produce,\npretends to no miracles for the vouching of his mission,\u201d but\nBoyle was aware of the argument that the Koran itself is\nmiraculous (in view of the disparity between it and what might\nreasonably be expected of its author in the absence of divine\ninspiration). He felt, not that this argument was inappropriate, but\nthat it failed the test empirically:\n\n[T]he Saracens, press\u2019d with their Religions being\ndestitute of attesting Miracles, \u2026 reply, That though there\nwere no other Miracle to manifest the Excellency of their Religion\n\u2026, yet the Alcoran it Self were sufficient, as being a Lasting\nMiracle that transcends all other Miracles. How Charming its Eloquence\nmay be in its Original, I confesse my self too unskilfull in the\nArabick Tongue, to be a competent Judge \u2026 but the Recent\nTranslations I have seen of it in French, and \u2026 Latin,\nelaborated by great Scholars, and accurate Arabicians, by making it\nvery Conformable to its Eastern Original, have not so rendred it, but\nthat Persons that judge of Rhetorick by the Rules of it current in\nthese Western Parts of the World, would instead of extolling it for\nthe Superlative, not allow it the Positive Degree of Eloquence; [and]\nwould think the Style as destitute of Graces, as the Theology of Truth\n \u2026.[27]\n\n\nBoyle does not deny that the style could have been miraculous, and\nindeed he runs a formally similar argument concerning the Apostles and\nthe miracle of Pentecost: the Apostles\u2019 \u201cHearers \u2026\nknew it was <not> naturally possible, that uninspir\u2019d\nPersons, and especially illiterate Fishermen, should <grow>\nable, in a trice, to make <weighty> discourses to many differing\nNations, in their respective Languages\u201d (BP 7:99, BOA\n\u00a73.6.29, p. 390). Boyle accepts, and indeed uses, the\nform of the Koran argument: it is the premise he\ndisputes.\n\nBoyle is ambivalent about the function of miracles. Generally he\nregards them as being philosophically relevant after we have a proof\nof God\u2019s existence, something which natural theology will afford\nus. (Boyle fastens on two main types of design arguments: those\ninvolving the complexity of animate beings, particularly very small\nanimate\n beings,[28]\n and those which highlight the need to explain the origin and\ncontinuing function of natural laws: God must not only sustain\nGod\u2019s creatures, Boyle argues, he must also sustain the\nregularities which we recognize as lawlike.)\n\nHaving convinced ourselves of God\u2019s existence through the\nconsiderations which natural theology makes available to us, and\nrealizing that God is likely to institute a religion to make his\nnature and requirements known to us, we look to miracles to see which\ninstituted religion is the correct one. However, though in general\nBoyle argues that accepting something as a miracle\npresupposes God\u2019s existence, and so miracles are to be\nused to institute the correct religion rather than to ground\nits metaphysical basis, he does sometimes urge an argument from\nmiracles which will yield not merely the correctness of Christianity,\nbut the acceptability of religious belief as such. Briefly: we have\ngood historical testimony for the occurrence of miracles, but miracles\nare possible only if God intervenes in nature (and thereby exists) (BP\n5:106\u20137, BOA \u00a73.8.3, pp. 310\u201312).\n",
