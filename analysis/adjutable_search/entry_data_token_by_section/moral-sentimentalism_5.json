    "main_text": "Judgment Sentimentalism || Non-Cognitivist Sentimentalism\n3.1 Non-Cognitivist Sentimentalism\n\nOn pure non-cognitivist views, moral thoughts are constituted by\nsentiments. To think that X is wrong is, at least in part, to\nhave a negative sentiment towards X, or perhaps to have a\nhigher-order positive attitude towards a negative sentiment towards\nX. Here is the most famous argument in favour of\nnon-cognitivism:\n\nThe Argument from Internalism\n\nMoral judgments are intrinsically at least defeasibly motivating.\n(Weak Internalism)\nOnly\n non-cognitive psychological states with a world-to-mind direction of\nfit are intrinsically motivating; beliefs, which have a mind-to-world\ndirection of fit, do not alone motivate (The Humean Theory of\nMotivation).\nSo, moral judgments are (at least in part) constituted by\nnon-cognitive psychological states.\n\n\nThe argument is clearly related to arguments from practicality against\nrationalism (see the\n Anti-Rationalism Supplement).\n The first premise postulates an internal connection between moral\njudgment and motivation. Weak Internalists believe, roughly, that\njudging that I morally ought to stop downloading movies entails that I\nhave at least some motivation to stop downloading movies. Otherwise I\ndon\u2019t genuinely regard the action as morally wrong. My moral\nconvictions are manifest in my motivational tendencies, if not always\nin action. Why? Basically, because the point of thinking in moral\nterms isn\u2019t to discover some facts about the universe, but to\nget ourselves to act in ways that allow us to live together and reap\nthe benefits of cooperation. Simon Blackburn (1988) and Allan Gibbard\n(1990) point out that any evolutionary benefits moral thought might\nhave depend on its practicality. (See also Lenman (1999) and the entry\non\n Moral Motivation.)\n\nThe second premise of the argument is a thesis in the philosophy of\nmind. Some mental states, like descriptive beliefs, represent how\nthings are, and have a mind-to-world direction of\nfit. Other mental states are not descriptive, though\nthey may have the same propositional content as beliefs. If you want\nyour car to work and notice that it refuses to start, your desire does\nnot tend to go out of existence, unlike your belief that your car is\nworking (Smith 1987). Rather, it moves you to do something you believe\nwould make the car work, such as call a mechanic. It has a\nworld-to-mind direction of fit. Although particular ways of\ndrawing the distinction remain controversial (see e.g. Sobel and Copp\n2001; Frost 2014), the key idea that descriptive beliefs themselves\nare motivationally inert is widely accepted.\n\nFinally, the conclusion comes in different strengths. Traditional\nnon-cognitivists believe that moral judgments simply are non-cognitive\nstates. But what kind of states? They are clearly not mere desires,\nsince we can desire things we don\u2019t regard as desirable. Early\nnon-cognitivists talked about a special \u2018ethical feeling\u2019\n(Ayer 1936), identified in phenomenological terms. But there\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be any common phenomenological character to all\nthe various moral thoughts we have. So contemporary non-cognitivists\nappeal to the functional role of moral attitudes instead, to\ntheir distinctive part in our overall psychology. Blackburn\u2019s\n(1998) idea is that moral thoughts involve higher-order attitudes\ntowards desires and preferences. When I morally disapprove of\npolluting the environment, I don\u2019t just desire not to pollute --\nI also applaud others who are averse to it and dislike those who fail\nto share my desire (Blackburn 2002: 125). When I morally disapprove of\nsomething, I also have these higher-order attitudes towards my own\nattitudes: I prefer not to prefer what I disapprove of, which explains\na defeasible link to motivation.\n\nGibbard (1990), in turn, identifies narrowly moral judgments with\njudgments about the rationality of guilt and resentment. To think that\nstealing is wrong, for example, is to think it rational to feel guilt\nfor stealing and resent others for stealing (in the absence of\nconditions like ignorance or force that excuse the agent). To think\nthat something is rational or makes sense, in turn, is to accept norms\nthat permit it. On Gibbard\u2019s original account, norm-acceptance\nis a basic kind of non-cognitive state, an evolutionary adaptation for\nlinguistically achieved coordination that is not analyzable in terms\nof other attitudes (1990: ch. 4). It is non-cognitive, because it is\nessentially a motivational tendency to act or feel in ways that we are\nprepared to avow in discussion about what to do. In later work, he\nconsiders normative thoughts as contingency plans that settle\nwhat to do in actual and non-actual situations (Gibbard 2003). These\nthoughts are defeasibly motivating, just as the Argument from\nInternalism requires.\n",
