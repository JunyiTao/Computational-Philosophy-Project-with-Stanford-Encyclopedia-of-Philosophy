Narrative Identity and the Turn to Selfhood\n\nAt the end of his three volume study of narrative (Time and\nNarrative, 1984\u201388) Ricoeur realized that what was said\nthere pointed to the importance of the idea of a narrative identity.\nThis has to do not just with the identity of the characters in a story\nor history, but with the larger claim that personal identity in every\ncase can be considered in terms of a narrative identity: what story\ndoes a person tell about his or her life, or what story do others tell\nabout it? In effect, narrative identity is one of the ways in which we\nanswer the question \u201cwho?\u201d Who is this? Who said that? Did\nthat? Who is that? Who are we? In his 1986 Gifford Lectures (published\nas Oneself as Another, 1992) Ricoeur expanded this\ninvestigation to the broader question of what it is to be a self. This\ndiscussion was meant to reply to interpretations of the Cartesian\ncogito which either made it too strong (one can immediately\nbe in touch with the self as certain of itself) or too weak (a merely\nabstract truth) or even said the self does not exist. Against this\nlatter idea of a \u201cshattered cogito\u201d Ricoeur proposed a\nhermeneutics of selfhood and a \u201cwounded cogito\u201d. This was\nthe idea and reality of a person capable of attesting to his or her\nown existence and acting in the world, a self that both acted and was\nacted upon who could recount and take responsibility for its actions.\nInsofar as we can speak metaphysically of such a self it has to be in\nterms of act and potentiality rather than substance.\n\nRicoeur\u2019s argument regarding selfhood proceeds through a\nsequence of stages. He begins from the philosophy of language and the\nquestion of an identifying reference to persons as selves, not simply\nthings. This leads to consideration of the speaking subject as an\nagent, passing through the semantics of action Ricoeur had learned\nfrom analytic philosophy during his time in North America. Next comes\nthe idea of the self as having a narrative identity which is then is\nfollowed by the question of the ethical aim of being such a self. This\nhermeneutics of selfhood culminates in the conclusion that one is a\nself as one self among other selves, something that can only be\nattested to through personal testimony or the testimony of others.\nSelfhood is thus closely tied to a kind of discourse that says\n\u201cI believe-in\u201d. Its certainty is a lived conviction rather\nthan a logical or scientific certainty.\n\nAlong the way Ricoeur to this conclusion introduces a key distinction\nbetween two kinds of identity in relation to selfhood. Idem\nidentity is the identity of something that is always the same which\nnever changes, ipse identity is sameness across and through\nchange. Self-identity involves both dimensions: I am and am not the\nperson I was ten years ago. It is the existence of ipse\nidentity that indicates that a self is better thought of in terms of\nthe question \u201cwho?\u201d than in terms of the question\n\u201cwhat\u201d is a self.\n\nSince the self is an agent the question of its ethical aim arises,\nallowing Ricoeur to introduce what he calls his \u201clittle\nethics\u201d. This introduces new predicates for the self and another\npath toward the self, one that shifts the argument from description\ntoward prescription. Ricoeur presents this little ethics through what\nhe calls its ethical intention: \u201caiming at a good life lived\nwith and for others in just institutions\u201d (Oneself as\nAnother, 1992: 172). This formula indicates that there is a\npriority of ethics (understood as teleological) over morality\n(understood as normative practice). In fact, the structure is\nthreefold: the ethical aim has to pass through the sieve of the norm,\nwhich is meant to realize the ethical intention, to be applied in\nspecific situations on the basis of phronesis or practical\nwisdom that will apply the norm appropriately. It is also possible to\nread the sequence backwards: for example, when a disaster, say a new\ndisease, leads to new normative practices growing out of the response\nto it, thereby throwing new light in turn on the ethical intention. At\nthe level of relations between a self and nearby or intimate others,\nthe ideal of reciprocity entailed here is best expressed as solicitude\nthat enables both self-esteem and self-respect on the parts of those\ninvolved. At the level of the distant other or others, the question of\njustice arises and with it new notions of respect and of institutions\nsuch as the rule of law that establish and help maintain or restore a\njust distance between those involved in them. Underlying both levels\nis the idea expressed by the golden rule that one ought not do to\nothers what one does not want done to him- or herself. And beyond\nevery institutionalized system of rules lies the transformative\npossibility of love which transcends the fragile and provisory\npractical meditations established by every ethical system through\napplying and, if necessary, reinterpreting the golden rule. Love is a\nway of responding not just to the limits of any such system but to the\ntragic dimension Ricoeur sees as inherent in all human action, which\nnever fully achieves what it intends, another reminder that human\nfreedom is always a finite freedom.\n",
