    "main_text": "Harm and Risk\n3. Harm and Risk\n\n\nThe first, and most straightforward, objection to organ sale is that\nit is excessively harmful or dangerous for paid organ donors.\nPresent-day organ trafficking certainly does involve excessive\nand unacceptable levels of harm. But, as mentioned earlier, when\nconsidering the moral permissibility of organ sale, it is advisable to\nfocus not on the worst case, but rather on the likely level of harm\nthat would occur within a properly regulated system. Once this is\nborne in mind, the harm argument against organ sale appears vulnerable\nto a number of objections.\n\n\nThe first (an empirical point) is that the most widely discussed form\nof organ sale, kidney sale, is not terribly dangerous if performed in\ngood conditions.  Radcliffe Richards makes the point as follows.\n\n\n\u2026 living organ donation is now so safe that many surgeons\nactively recommend it, and they would hardly do that if they expected\na string of dead or damaged donors. They expect that virtually all\ndonors will make a full recovery to normal health. But the only\nobvious difference between paid and unpaid donation is that the vendor\nreceives something in return which is, to all appearances, a positive\nadvantage. (Radcliffe Richards 2012, 55).\n\nThe UK body NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), for example, informs\nus that the risk of postoperative death (to the donor) is about one in\n3,000. There is also a small risk (less than 1%) of minor\ncomplications (such as chest, wound, or urine infections). As regards\nlong-term health risks, NHSBT claims that there is no long-term effect\non the health of the donor or on his/her remaining kidney, and that\ndonors are at no greater risk of developing kidney failure after\ndonating than anyone in the general population. So, while there are\nsome not completely insignificant risks to consider, arguably these\nare tolerable compared to both the risks to the prospective recipient\nof not receiving the kidney, and the financial benefit to the donor,\nprovided that the level of reward is set at a suitably high level.\n\n\nThe second objection says that, if our concern is exposing the organ\nvendor to risk, then the last thing we should be doing is banning sale\nsince, as Cameron and Hoffenberg put it:\n\n\nIt is the marginalization of paid organ donation that leads to its\nperformance in less than ideal circumstances. Paid organ donations need\nbe no more risky than unpaid.\n\n\n\nIn other words, the best way of avoiding harm to organ vendors is\nnot to criminalize and drive sale underground but rather to accept and\nregulate it. This style of argument is familiar from other contexts:\nnotably debates about the legalization of abortion, drugs, and\nprostitution.\n\n\nThe third (related) objection is that no matter how dangerous paid\ndonation is, it need not be any\nmore dangerous than unpaid donation, since the mere fact of payment\ndoes not add any danger. So if paid donation is wrong because of the\ndanger to which the donor is subjected, then free donation must also be\nwrong on the very same ground. Free donation, though, is not wrong; on\nthe contrary, it is generally regarded as commendable and heroic.\nTherefore, paid donation is not wrong either; or, if it is wrong, it is\nwrong because of something other than the danger to which the donor is\nsubjected (Radcliffe Richards 2012; Wilkinson and Garrard 1996).\n\n\nIt might be argued that what is wrong with organ sale is not danger\nper se but rather the fact that someone is being paid to\nendanger herself. There are two readings of this. One is as a worry\nabout consent, the idea being that payment invalidates the\nvendor's consent; this will be examined in Section 5. The other\nis as a moral principle according to which (independently of concerns\nabout consent) it is wrong to pay someone to endanger herself. Quite\nwhat the basis for such a principle might be is hard to fathom and it\ndoes seem implausible for reasons given during the earlier discussion\nof consistency. Paying people to undertake dangerous and/or\nunpleasant work is widespread and, while the world might well be a\nbetter place if people were not required to undertake such tasks, it\nwould be hard to defend the view that all such arrangements are wrong:\nespecially in those cases where the work is done voluntarily for fair\npay.\n",
