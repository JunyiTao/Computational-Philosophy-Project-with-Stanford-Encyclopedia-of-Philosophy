    "main_text": "Khayyam the Mathematician and Scientist || Astronomy and Other Works\n4.4 Astronomy and Other Works\nKhayyam moved to Is\u0323fah\u0101n in 1074 to help establish a new observatory under the patronage of Jal\u0101l al-Din Malik-sh\u0101h, the Seljuk sultan, and his vizier, Ni\u1e93\u0101m al-Mulk. Undoubtedly, Khayyam played a major role in the creation of the Malik\u012b or Jalali calendar, the observatory\u2019s most significant project. Khayyam succeeded in devising a calendar more accurate than the current Western Gregorian calendar, needing correction of one day every 5,000 years compared to every 3,333 years respectively. In addition to the calendar, the Is\u0323fah\u0101n observatory produced the Z\u012bj Malik-sh\u0101h\u012b (of which only a fragment of its star catalogue survives), apparently one of the more important astronomical handbooks (Youschkevitch and Rosenfeld 1973, 324).\nRemaining works attributed to Khayyam in other fields are:\n\n\u201cTreatise on the Difficulties of the \u2018Book of Music\u2019 (by Euclid)\u201d (Shar\u1e25 al-mushkil min kit\u0101b al-musiq\u012b). Only one chapter titled \u201cDiscussion on Genera Contained in a Fourth\u201d (Al-Qawl \u2018al\u0101 ajn\u0101s allat\u012b bi\u2019l-arba\u2018a) is extant. For a critical edition see Ch\u0101vosh\u012b, \u201cOmar al-Khayyam wa\u2019l-musiq\u012b al-nad\u0323ariyyah,\u201d translated into English by M.M. \u2018Abd al-Jalil, Farhang, vol. 1, 14 (1378 A.H.s.): 29\u201332 and 203\u2013214.\n\u201cThe Balance of Wisdoms\u201d (Miz\u0101n al-\u1e25ikmah), \u201cTwo Treatises on the Level Balance\u201d (Fi\u2019l-qus\u1e6das al-mustaq\u012bm), and \u201cOn the Art of Determination of Gold and Silver in a Body Consisting of Them\u201d (Ris\u0101lah fi\u2019l- i\u1e25tiy\u0101j lima\u200b\u2018rifat miqd\u0101\u1e5b\u012b al-dhahab wa\u2019l-fid\u0323ah f\u012b jism murakkab minh\u0101) in D\u0101nish n\u0101mah-yi Khayy\u0101m\u012b, Malik (ed.) 1377 A.H.s., 293\u2013300, and Persian trans., 301\u2013304.\n\u201cOn discovering the truth of Nor\u016bz\u201d (Ris\u0101lah dar kashf \u1e25aqiqat Nor\u016bz) in D\u0101nish n\u0101mah-yi Khayy\u0101m\u012b, Malik (ed.) 1377 A.H.s., 424\u2013438.\n\nBook III of \u201cCommentary on the Difficulties of Certain Postulates of Euclid\u2019s Work\u201d shows Khayyam discussing how compounding ratios in music composition are numerical. In this discussion, Khayyam refers to his earlier commentary of Euclid\u2019s \u201cBook of Music\u201d (Rashed and Vahabzadeh, 2000, 251\u2013252). However, only one chapter \u201cDiscussion on Genera Contained in a Fourth\u201d of Khayyam\u2019s commentary discussing tetrachords (a series of four notes separated by three intervals) survives (Aminrazavi 2007, 198\u2013199).\nKhayyam\u2019s treatise \u201cOn the Art of Determination of Gold and Silver in a Body Consisting of Them\u201d appears in the book Miz\u0101n al-\u1e25ikmah written by his student Abd\u2019l-Ra\u1e25m\u0101n Kh\u0101zeni (fl. 1115\u20131130). Kh\u0101zeni attributes this article, as well as the \u201cTwo Treatises on the Level Balance,\u201d to Khayyam. Techniques for determining the proportions of gold and silver in a compound date back to Archimedes, and Khayyam\u2019s contribution appears to be the precision of his method along with the intricate designs of his level balance (Hall 1981, 341\u2013343).\nAnother treatise titled \u201cOn discovering the truth of Nor\u016bz\u201d is apocryphal, where only one of its three parts is believed to have been written by Khayyam. Khayyam allegedly writes of the history and mythology of the Persian new year at the beginning of the spring equinox, although the style and errors of the text lend doubt to Khayyam\u2019s authorship (Aminrazavi 2007, 38).\nAs with his philosophical and mathematical writings, Khayyam\u2019s texts in other disciplines appear to have been taken seriously by his contemporaries and later scholars.\n",
