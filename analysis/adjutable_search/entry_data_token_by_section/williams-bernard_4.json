    "main_text": "\u201cThe day cannot be too far off\u2026\u201d: Williams against utilitarianism\n5. Internal and external reasons\n\nIn his famous paper \u201cInternal and external reasons\u201d (1981:\n101\u2013113) Williams presents what I\u2019ll call \u201cthe\ninternal reasons thesis\u201d: the claim that all reasons are\ninternal, and that there are no external reasons.\n\nThe internal reasons thesis is a view about how to read sentences of\nthe form \u201cA has reason to \u03c6\u201d. We can read such\nsentences as implying that \u201cA has some motive which will be\nserved or furthered by his \u03c6ing\u201d (1981: 101), so that, if\nthere is no such motive, it will not be true that \u201cA has reason\nto \u03c6\u201d. This is the internal interpretation of such\nsentences. We can also read sentences of the form \u201cA has reason\nto \u03c6\u201d as not implying this, but as saying that A has reason\nto \u03c6 even if none of his motives will be served or furthered by\nhis \u03c6ing. This is the external interpretation of such\nsentences, on which, according to Williams, all such sentences are\nfalse.\n\nSince he is widely misinterpreted on this point, it is important to\nsee that Williams is only offering a necessary condition for\nthe truth of sentences of the form \u201cA has reason to\n\u03c6\u201d. He is not (officially) committed to the stronger claim,\nthat the presence of some motive which is served or furthered by\n\u03c6ing is sufficient for the possession of a reason to\n\u03c6. Officially, then, Williams is not defining or fully analyzing\nthe concept of a reason; rather, the necessary condition itself\nrepresents a threat. (We say \u201cofficially\u201d because there\nare indications that Williams unofficially held a stronger view; see\nthe final paragraphs in this piece for elaboration.)\n\nVery roughly, then, the basic idea of Williams\u2019 internal reasons\nthesis is that we cannot have genuine reasons to act that have no\nconnection whatever with anything that we care about. His positive\ndefense of the thesis can be roughly stated as follows: since it must\nbe possible for an agent to act for a reason, reasons must be\ncapable of explaining actions. This argument, it should be\nnoted, brings together a normative and a descriptive concept in a\nrobustly naturalistic manner. The notion of a reason, he argues, is\ninextricably bound up with the notion of explanation. Absent a motive\nwhich can be furthered by some action, it seems impossible for an\nagent to actually perform the action except under conditions of false\ninformation. If an external reason is one that is supposed to obtain\nin the absence of the relevant motive even under conditions of full\ninformation, then external reasons can never explain actions, and\nhence cannot be reasons at all (1981: 107).\n\nThis thesis presents a challenge to certain natural and traditional\nways of thinking about ethics. When we tell someone that he should not\nrob bank-vaults or murder bank-clerks, we usually understand ourselves\nto be telling him that he has reason not to rob bank-vaults\nor murder bank-clerks. If the internal reasons thesis is true, then\nthe bank-robber can prove that he has no such reason simply by showing\nthat he doesn\u2019t care about anything that is achieved by\nabstaining from bank-robbing. So we seem to reach the disturbing\nconclusion that morality\u2019s rules are like the rules of some\nsport or parlour-game\u2014they apply only to those who choose to\njoin in by obeying them.\n\nOne easy way out of this is to distinguish between moral\ndemands and moral reasons. If all reasons to act are\ninternal reasons, then it certainly seems that the bank-robber has no\nreason not to rob banks. It doesn\u2019t follow that the\nbank-robber is not subject to a moral demand not to rob\nbanks. If (as we naturally assume) there is no opting out of obeying\nthe rules of morality, then everyone will be subject to that moral\ndemand, including the bank-robber. In that case, however, this moral\ndemand will not be grounded on a reason that applies\nuniversally\u2014to everyone, and hence even to the bank-robber. At\nmost it will be grounded in the reasons that some of us have,\nto want there to be no bank-robbing, and in the thought that it would\nbe nice if people like the bank-robber were to give more general\nrecognition to the presence of that sort of reason in\nothers\u2014were, indeed, to add it to their own repertoire of\nreasons.\n\nIf we take this way out, then the moral demand not to rob banks will\nturn out to be grounded not on universally-applicable moral reasons,\nbut on something more like Humean empathy. Williams himself thinks\nthat this is, in general, a much better way to ground moral demands\nthan the appeal to reasons (\u201cHaving sympathetic concern for\nothers is a necessary condition of being in the world of\nmorality\u201d, 1972: 26; cp. 1981: 122, 1985 Ch.2). In this he\nstands outside the venerable tradition of rationalism in ethics, which\ninsists that if moral demands cannot be founded on moral\nreasons, then there is something fundamentally suspect about morality\nitself. It is this tradition that is threatened by the internal\nreasons thesis.\n\nOf course, we might wonder how significant the threat really is. As we\nparaphrased it, the internal reasons thesis says that \u201cwe cannot\nhave genuine reasons to act that have no connection whatever with\nanything that we care about\u201d. Let us take up this notion of\n\u201cconnections\u201d. As Williams stresses, the internal reasons\nthesis is not the view that, unless I actually have a given\nmotive M, I cannot have an internal reason corresponding to\n M.[27]\n The view is rather that I will have no internal reason unless either\n(a) I actually have a given motivation M in my\n\u201csubjective motivational set\u201d (\u201cmy S\u201d: 1981:\n102), or (b) I could come to have M by following \u201ca\nsound deliberative route\u201d (MSH 35) from the beliefs and\nmotivations that I do actually have\u2014that is, a way of reasoning\nthat builds conservatively on what I already believe and care about.\nSo, to cite Williams\u2019 own example (1981: 102), the internal\nreasons thesis is not falsified by the case of someone who is\nmotivated to drink gin and believes that this is gin, hence is\nmotivated to drink this\u2014where \u201cthis\u201d is in fact\npetrol. We are not obliged to say, absurdly, that this person has a\ngenuine internal reason to drink petrol, nor to say, in contradiction\nof the internal reasons thesis, that this person has a genuine\nexternal reason not to drink what is in front of him. Rather we should\nnote the fact that, even though he is not actually motivated not to\ndrink the petrol, he would be motivated not to drink it\nif he realised that it was petrol. He can get to the\nmotivation not to drink it by a sound deliberative route from where he\nalready is; hence, by (b), he has an internal reason not to drink the\npetrol.\n\nIt is this notion of \u201csound deliberative routes\u201d that\nprompts the question, how big a threat the internal reasons thesis\nreally is to ethical rationalism. Going back to the bank-robber, we\nmight point out how very unlikely it is to be true that he\ndoesn\u2019t care about anything that is achieved by not\nrobbing banks, or lost by robbing them. Doesn\u2019t the bank-robber\nwant, like anyone else, to be part of society? Doesn\u2019t he want,\nlike anyone else, the love and admiration of others? If he has either\nof these motivations, or any of a galaxy of other similar ones, then\nthere will very probably be a sound deliberative route from the\nmotivations that the bank-robber actually has, to the conclusion that\neven he should be motivated not to rob banks; hence, that even he has\ninternal reason not to rob banks. But then, of course, it seems likely\nthat we can extend and generalise this pattern of argument, and\nthereby show that just about anyone has the reasons that (a sensible)\nmorality says they have. For just about anyone will have internal\nreason to do all the things that morality says they should do,\nprovided only that they have any of the kind of social and extroverted\nmotivations that we located in the bank-robber, and used to ground his\ninternal reason not to rob banks. Hence, we might conclude, the\ninternal reasons thesis is no threat either to traditional ethical\nrationalism, nor indeed to traditional morality\u2014not at least\nonce this is shorn by critical reflection of various excrescences that\nreally are unreasonable.\n\nThis line of thought does echo a pattern of argument that is found in\nmany ethicists, from Plato\u2019s Republic to Philippa\nFoot\u2019s \u201cMoral Beliefs\u201d. However, it does not ward\noff the threat to ethical rationalism. The threat still lurks in the\n\u201cif\u201d. We have suggested that the bank-robber will have\ninternal reason not to rob banks, if he shares in certain\nnormal human social motivations. But what if he doesn\u2019t\nshare in these? The problem is not merely that, if he doesn\u2019t,\nthen we won\u2019t know what to say to him. The problem is that the\napplicability of moral reasons is still conditional on people\u2019s\nactual motivations, and local to those people who have the right\nmotivations. But it seems to be a central thought about moral reasons,\nas they have traditionally been understood, that they should be\nunconditionally and universally overriding: that it\nshould not be possible even in principle for any rational agent to\nstand outside their reach, or to elude them simply by saying\n\u201cSorry, but I just don\u2019t care about\nmorality\u201d. On the present line of thought, this possibility\nremains open; and so the internal reasons thesis remains a threat to\nethical rationalism.\n\nOne way of responding to this continuing threat is to find an argument\nfor saying that every agent has, at least fundamentally, the same\nmotivations: hence moral reasons, being built upon these motivations,\nare indeed unconditionally and universally overriding, as the ethical\nrationalist hoped to show. One way of doing this is the\nThomist-Aristotelian way, which grounds the universality of our\nmotivations in our shared nature as human beings, and in certain\nclaims which are taken to be essentially true about humans just as\n such.[28]\n Another is the Kantian way, which grounds the universality of our\nmotivations in our shared nature as agents, and in certain claims\nwhich are taken to be essentially true about agents just as such.\n\nIt is interesting to note that this sort of ethical-rationalist\nresponse to the internal reasons thesis can seem to undercut\nWilliams\u2019 distinction between external and internal reasons. For\nthe\n Thomist/neo-Aristotelian[29]\n or the Kantian, the point is not that we can truly say, with the\nexternal reasons theorist, that an agent has some reasons that bear no\nrelation at all to the motivations in his present S\n(subjective motivational set), or even to those motivations he might\ncome, by some sound deliberative route, to derive from his present\nS. The point is rather that there are some motivations which\nare derivable from any S\n whatever.[30]\n Williams himself recognises this point in the case of Kant (WME 220,\nnote 3): \u201cKant thought that a person would recognise the demands\nof morality if he or she deliberated correctly from his or her\nexisting S, whatever that S might be, but he thought\nthis because he took those demands to be implicit in a conception of\npractical reason which he could show to apply to any rational\ndeliberator as such. I think that it best preserves the point of\nthe internalism/ externalism distinction to see this as a limiting\ncase of\n internalism.\u201d[31]\n\nSo for the Kantian and the neo-Aristotelian or Thomist, there are\nmotivations which appear to ground internal reasons only, since the\nreasons that they ground are always genuinely related to whatever the\nagent actually cares about. On the other hand, these motivations also\nappear to ground reasons which have exactly the key features that the\nethical rationalist wanted to find in external reasons. Two in\nparticular: first, these reasons are unconditional, because\nthey depend on features of the human being (Aquinas) or the agent\n(Kant) which are essential features\u2014it is a necessary\ntruth that these features are present; and second, these reasons are\nuniversal, because they depend on ubiquitous\nfeatures\u2014features which are present in every human or\nagent. So Williams\u2019 response to the neo-Aristotelian or the\nKantian view of practical reason had better not be (and indeed is not)\nsimply to invoke his internal reasons thesis. As he realises, he also\nneeds to argue that there can\u2019t be reasons of the kinds that the\nneo-Aristotelian and the Kantian posit: reasons which are genuinely\nunconditional, but also genuinely related to each and every\nagent\u2019s actual motivations. Whatever else may be wrong with the\nneo-Aristotelian and Kantian theories of practical reason, it\nwon\u2019t be simply that they invoke external reasons; for it is\nfairly clear that they don\u2019t (the contemporary Kantian\nphilosopher who has most effectively pushed this point is Christine\nKorsgaard, see her Sources of Normativity, 1996).\n\nIf not even Kant counts as an external reasons theorist, who does?\nThat is a natural question at this point, since it is probably Kant\nwho is usually taken to be the main target of Williams\u2019 argument\nagainst external reasons. This assumption is perhaps based on the\nevidence of 1981: 106, where (despite the points we have already noted\nabout Kant\u2019s theory which Williams recognised at least by 1995)\nWilliams certainly attributes to Kant the view that there can be\n\u201can \u2018ought\u2019 which applies to an agent independently\nof what the agent happens to want\u201d. Even here, however, Williams\nis actually rather cagey about saying that Kant is an external reasons\ntheorist: he tells us that the question \u2018What is the status of\nexternal reasons claims?\u2019 is \u201cnot the same question as\nthat of the status of a supposed categorical imperative\u201d;\n\u201cor rather, it is not undoubtedly the same question\u201d,\nsince the relation between oughts and reasons is a difficult issue,\nand anyway there are certainly external reasons claims which are not\nmoral claims at all, such as Williams\u2019 own example of Owen\nWingrave\u2019s family\u2019s pressure on him to follow his father\nand grandfather into the army (1981: 106).\n\nIn any case, it is important to see that there do not have to be\nany examples of philosophers who clear-headedly and\ndefinitely espouse an external reasons theory. The point is rather\nthat no one could be a clear-headed and definite external reasons\ntheorist if Williams is right, because, in that case, the notion of\nexternal reasons is basically unintelligible (MSH 39:\n\u201cmysterious\u201d, \u201cquite obscure\u201d).\nWilliams\u2019 internal reasons thesis is that it is unintelligible\nto suppose that something could genuinely be a reason for me to act\nwhich yet had no relation either to anything I care about, nor to\nanything that I might, without brainwashing or other violence to my\ndeliberative capacities, come to care\n about.[32]\n If this thesis is true, then perhaps we should not expect to find any\ndefinite examples of clear-headed external reasons theorists. It will\nbe no surprise if someone who tries to develop a clear-headed external\nreasons theory turns out not to be definitely an external\nreasons theorist: thus for example John McDowell\u2019s theory in WME\nEssay 5, even though it is explicitly presented as an example of\nexternal reasons theory, is probably not best understood that way.\n(Very quickly, this is because McDowell wants to develop an external\nreasons theory as a view about moral perception, \u201cthe\nacquisition of a way of seeing things\u201d (WME 73). But\nliteral perception does not commit us to external reasons.\nWhen I literally \u201cjust see\u201d something, my visual\nperception\u2014even my well-habituated and skilful\nperception\u2014adds something to my stock of internal, not external,\nreasons. If we take the perceptual analogy seriously in ethics, it is\nhard to see why we can\u2019t say the same about moral perceptions.)\nNor, conversely, will it be surprising if someone who tries to develop\nwhat is definitely an external reasons theory turns out not to be, so\nfar forth, very clear-headed. Thus Peter Singer\u2019s exhortations\nto us to take up the moral point of view (see e.g. Practical\nEthics\n 10\u201311[33])\n give us perhaps the most definite example available of an external\nreasons theory in contemporary moral philosophy\u2014but are also one\nof the least clearly-explained or justified parts of Singer\u2019s\nposition. The notion of an external reason is, basically, a confused\nnotion, and Williams\u2019 fundamental aim is to expose the\n confusion.[34]\n\nThe fact that there can be no clear and intelligible account of\nexternal reasons has important consequences, consequences which go to\nthe heart of the morality system discussed in sections 2 and 3, and\nwhich also relate back to the critique of utilitarianism that we saw\nWilliams develop in section 4. If there can be no external reasons,\nthen there is no possibility of saying that the same set of moral\nreasons is equally applicable to all agents. (Not at least unless some\nuniversalising system like Kantianism or neo-Aristotelianism can be\nvindicated without recourse to external reasons; Williams, as\nwe\u2019ve seen, rejects these systems on other grounds.) Deprived of\nthis possibility, we are thrown immediately into a\nhistoricised way of doing ethics\u2014a project with roots\nin both the Hegelian and Nietzschean traditions. No absolute\nconception of ethics will be available to us; hence, neither will the\nkind of impartiality that utilitarianism depends upon. Agents\u2019\nreasons, and what agents\u2019 reasons can become, will always be\nrelativised to their particular contexts and their particular lives;\nand that fact too will be another manifestation of \u201cmoral\nluck\u201d.\n\nFurthermore\u2014a consequence that Williams particularly\nemphasises\u2014without external reasons, or alternatively something\nlike Kantianism or neo-Aristotelianism, there will be no possibility\nof deploying the notion of blame in the way that the morality\nsystem wants to deploy it. \u201cBlame involves treating the person\nwho is blamed like someone who had a reason to do the right thing but\ndid not do it\u201d (MSH 42). But in cases where someone had no\ninternal reason to do (what we take to be) the right thing\nthat they did not do, it was not in fact true that they had\nany reason to do that thing; for internal reasons are the\nonly reasons. Typical cases of blaming people will, then, often have\nan unsettling feature closely related to one that we noted at the\nbeginning of this section. They will rest on the fiction that the\npeople blamed had really signed up for the standards whereby they are\nblamed. And so, once again, there will seem to be something optional\nabout adherence to the standards of morality: morality will seem to be\nescapable in just the sense that the morality system denies.\n\nWilliams\u2019 denial of the possibility of external\nreasons\u2014understood in light of his naturalism and his\nanti-systematic outlook\u2014thus underwrites and supports his views\non a whole range of other matters. And though the internal reasons\nthesis too is, in an important way, a negative thesis, it is arguably\nthe cornerstone of a more robust, positive conception of our practical\nlives. While he only defended the negative condition in print, there\nis evidence that Williams actually believed that the right kind of\nstrong desire is a sufficient condition for the possession of a\npractical reason. In Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy, he\nbriefly opined that \u201cdesiring to do something is of course a\nreason for doing it,\u201d (1985:19), and he developed a theory of\npractical necessity according to which our deep commitments\n(\u201cground projects\u201d) necessarily constrain and direct our\npractical rationality (MSH 17).\n\nSeen in this light, the internal reasons thesis is the seed out of\nwhich most of Williams\u2019 ethical ideas grow. At the outset of his\nwriting career, he took for his own \u201ca phrase of D.H.\nLawrence\u2019s in his splendid commentary on the complacent moral\nutterances of Benjamin Franklin: \u2018Find your deepest impulse, and\nfollow that\u2019\u201d (1972: 93). Thirty years later he added,\nwhen looking back over his career, \u201cIf there\u2019s one theme\nin all my work it\u2019s about authenticity and\nself-expression\u2026 It\u2019s the idea that some things are in\nsome real sense really you, or express what you and others\naren\u2019t\u2026. The whole thing has been about spelling out the\nnotion of inner\n necessity.\u201d[35]\n",
