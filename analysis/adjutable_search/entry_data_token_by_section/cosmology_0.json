Cosmology\u2019s Standard Model\n\nPhysical cosmology has achieved a consensus Standard Model (SM), based\non extending the local physics governing gravity and the other forces\nto describe the overall structure of the universe and its evolution.\nAccording to the SM, the universe has evolved from an extremely high\ntemperature early state, by expanding, cooling, and developing\nstructures at various scales, such as galaxies and stars. This model\nis based on bold extrapolations of existing theories\u2014applying\ngeneral relativity, for example, at length scales 14 orders of\nmagnitude larger than the those at which it has been tested\u2014and\nrequires several novel ingredients, such as dark matter and dark\nenergy. The last few decades have been a golden age of physical\ncosmology, as the SM has been developed in rich detail and\nsubstantiated by compatibility with a growing body of observations.\nHere we will briefly introduce some of the central concepts of the SM\nto provide the minimal background needed for the ensuing\n discussion.[2]\n\n",
