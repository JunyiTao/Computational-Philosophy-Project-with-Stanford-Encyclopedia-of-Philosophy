Therefore (a) Heracleitus\u2019\ntheory of flux no more helps to prove that knowledge is\nperception than that knowledge is not perception,\nand (b) Heracleiteans cannot coherently say anything at all, not even\nto state their own doctrine.\n\n\nThere are two variants of the argument. On the first of these\nvariants, evident in 181c2\u2013e10, Socrates distinguishes just\ntwo kinds of flux or process, namely qualitative alteration\nand spatial motion, and insists that the Heracleiteans are committed\nto saying that both are continual. On the second variant, evident\nperhaps at 182a1, 182e4\u20135, Socrates distinguishes indefinitely many\nkinds of flux or process, not just qualitative alteration and motion\nthrough space, and insists that the Heracleiteans are committed to\nsaying that every kind of flux is continual.\n\n\nNow the view that everything is always changing in every way might\nseem a rather foolish view to take about everyday objects. But, as\n182a2\u2013b8 shows, the present argument is not about everyday objects\nanyway. Plato does not apply his distinction between kinds of change\nto every sort of object whatever, including everyday objects. He\napplies it specifically to the objects (if that is the word) of\nHeracleitean metaphysics. These items are supposed by the Heracleitean\nto be the reality underlying all talk of everyday objects. It is at\nthe level of these Heracleitean perceivings and perceivers that\nPlato\u2019s argument against Heracleitus is pitched. And it is not\nobviously silly to suppose that Heracleitean perceivings and\nperceivers are constantly changing in every way.\n\n\nThe argument that Socrates presents on the Heracleiteans\u2019 behalf\ninfers from \u201cEverything is always changing in every way\u201d\nthat \u201cNo description of anything is excluded.\u201d How does\nthis follow?  McDowell 1976: 181\u20132 finds the missing link in the\nimpossibility of identifications. We cannot (says McDowell)\nidentify a moving sample of whiteness, or of seeing, any\nlonger once it has changed into some other colour, or\nperception.\n\n\nBut this only excludes reidentifications: presumably I can\nidentify the moving whiteness or the moving seeing until it\nchanges, even if this only gives me an instant in which to identify\nit.  This point renders McDowell\u2019s version, as it stands, an invalid\nargument. If it is on his account possible to identify the moving\nwhiteness until it changes, then it is on his account\npossible to identify the moving whiteness. But if that is possible,\nthen his argument contradicts itself: for it goes on to deny this\npossibility.\n\n\nSome other accounts of the argument also commit this fallacy.  Compare\nSayre\u2019s account (1969: 94): \u201cIf no statement, either affirmative\nor negative, can remain true for longer than the time taken in its\nutterance, then no statement can be treated as either true or false,\nand the cause of communicating with one\u2019s fellow beings must be given\nup as hopeless.\u201d \n\n\nSayre\u2019s argument aims at the conclusion \u201cNo statement can be\ntreated as either true or false.\u201d But Sayre goes via the premiss\n\u201cAny statement remains true no longer than the time taken in its\nutterance.\u201d If there are statements which are true,\neven if they are not true for very long, it is not clear why these\nstatements cannot be treated as true, at least in\nprinciple (and in practice too, given creatures with the right sensory\nequipment and sense of time).\n\n\nMcDowell\u2019s and Sayre\u2019s versions of the argument also face the\nfollowing objection. It is obvious how, given flux, a present-tense\nclaim like \u201cItem X is present\u201d can quickly cease\nto be true, because e.g., \u201cItem Y is present\u201d\ncomes to replace it. But it isn\u2019t obvious why flux should exclude the\npossibility of past-tense statements like \u201cItem X\nflowed into item Y between t1 and\nt2,\u201d or of tenseless statements like\n\u201cItem X is present at t1, item\nY is present at t2.\u201d As Bostock\n1988: 105\u20136 points out, \u201cSo long as we do have a language with\nstable meanings, and the ability to make temporal distinctions, there\nis no difficulty at all about describing an ever-changing\nworld.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo long as\u201d: to make the argument workable, we\nmay suggest that its point is that the meanings of words are\nexempt from flux. If meanings are not in flux, and if we have access\nto those meanings, nothing stops us from identifying the whiteness at\nleast until it flows away. But if meanings are in flux too, we will\nhave the result that the argument against Heracleitus actually\nproduces at 183a5: anything at all will count equally well as\nidentifying or not identifying the whiteness. \u201cUnless we\nrecognise some class of knowable entities exempt from the Heracleitean\nflux and so capable of standing as the fixed meanings of words, no\ndefinition of knowledge can be any more true than its\ncontradictory. Plato is determined to make us feel the need of his\nForms without mentioning them\u201d (Cornford 1935, 99).\n",
