    "main_text": "\n\nSubstances, according to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646\u20131716),\nalways act; furthermore, since even finite, created substances are\nnaturally indestructible and thus immortal, substances continue to act\nforever. To what or to whom do substances causally owe their action?\nIn Leibniz\u2019s day, this question more or less becomes a question\nabout the causal role of God. Is God the only genuine causal agent in\nnature? Or does God\u2019s causal contribution, at least in the\nordinary development of nature, consist \u201cmerely\u201d in the\ncreation and conservation of created substances? We will see that\nLeibniz holds that both God and created substances are causally\nresponsible for changes in the states of substances. There is another\nquestion particularly salient for the seventeenth century philosopher:\nWhat kinds of causes are present in substantial activity? Just thirty\nyears after Leibniz\u2019s death, David Hume stated that his own\ndefinition of cause entails that \u201call causes are of the same\nkind,\u201d namely, efficient (i.e., productive) causes.\nLeibniz\u2019s theory of causation instead integrates efficient,\nfinal, and even formal causes, as it tries to explain away real\ncausation among phenomenal things with his infamous pre-established\nharmony.\n",
