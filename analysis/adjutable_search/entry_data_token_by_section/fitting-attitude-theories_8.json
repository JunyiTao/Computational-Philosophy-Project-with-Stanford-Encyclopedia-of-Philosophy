    "main_text": "Attractions || Unifying the Evaluative\n2.3 Unifying the Evaluative\n\nA third attraction of FA theory is its potential to unify the\nevaluative properties it aims to explain, by identifying what\u2019s\ncommon to those properties, while also clarifying important\ndifferences among them. As an initial example, consider the various\nways of being good simpliciter. A thing might be good\ninstrumentally, noninstrumentally, intrinsically, extrinsically, in\nsome respect, or overall. An FA theory of being good\nsimpliciter can be applied to provide unifying explanations\nof all these ways of having this property (McHugh and Way 2016;\nRowland 2019). Perhaps the most popular way to do this is to appeal to\ndifferent ways of valuing. For instance, an FA theorist might\nhold that whenever something is noninstrumentally good\nthat\u2019s\u00a0because it\u2019s fitting to value for its own\nsake, whereas when something is instrumentally good,\nthat\u2019s\u00a0because it\u2019s fitting to value ultimately\nfor the sake of something else (viz., something that\u2019s\nfitting to value for its own sake). For example, they might say that\nhard work is instrumentally good because it\u2019s fitting to value\nultimately for the sake of any reward it brings that's itself fitting\nto value for its own sake. Similarly, FA theorists might hold that\nwhenever something is intrinsically (extrinsically) good,\nthat\u2019s\u00a0because it\u2019s fitting to value that thing\nintrinsically (extrinsically), i.e., for its intrinsic (extrinsic)\nproperties. For example, they might say that wisdom is intrinsically\ngood because it\u2019s fitting to value for certain of its intrinsic\nfeatures, whereas money is extrinsically good because it\u2019s\nfitting to value for certain of its extrinsic, relational properties.\nLikewise, the FA theorist might explain facts about a thing being good\nin some respect (overall) in terms of facts to the effect that\nit\u2019s fitting to value that thing in that respect (overall). For\ninstance, they might hold that one outcome is good overall because\nit\u2019s fitting to value on the whole, whereas another outcome is\nbad overall, but good in some respect, because it\u2019s fitting to\nvalue in that respect (but not overall). And these accounts can of\ncourse be combined to explain any way of being good that consists in a\ncomplex of some possible subset of any of the above ways of possessing\nthis property. For example, an FA theorist might claim that whenever\nsomething is noninstrumentally, extrinsically good in some respect,\nthat\u2019s just because it\u2019s fitting to value that thing for\nits own sake, for its extrinsic properties, in the relevant respect.\nAnd there are other possibilities for the FA theorist here, beyond\nappealing to different ways of valuing. For example, an FA theorist\nmight propose to explain the difference between something being good\nin a respect as opposed to being good overall not by appeal to\ndifferences in the ways of valuing that figure in their accounts of\nthese properties, but rather by appeal to differences in the normative\nproperties that their accounts deploy. For instance, Rowland (2019)\nsuggests that whenever something is good in a respect, that\u2019s\nbecause there\u2019s a pro tanto reason to value it, whereas\nwhen something is good overall, that\u2019s because there\u2019s\nsufficient reason to value it. Which approach is more\nplausible is a matter of intramural debate.\n\nIn addition to offering unifying explanations of all the ways of being\ngood simpliciter, FA theories also promise to unify other\nvarieties of value. For example, just as we might offer FA theories of\nbeing good simpliciter, we might also offer them of the\nproperties of being attributively good and of being good\nfor some person or thing (Schroeder 2010; Skorupski 2010;\nMcHugh and Way 2016; Rowland 2019). For example, McHugh and Way (2016)\nsuggest as a first pass that whenever something, x, is\nattributively good, or good as a kind of thing K,\nthat\u2019s fully\u00a0because it\u2019s fitting for anyone for whom\nit\u2019s fitting to want a K to value x. And\naccording to Rowland (2019), whenever something, x, is good\nfor some person or thing, S, that\u2019s\u00a0because there\nare reasons for anyone who has reasons to care about S to\nvalue x, because they have reasons to care about S.\nAnd the prospects seem at least equally good for a fittingness-based\nFA theory to explain the relation of being good for, and for a\nreasons-based FA theory to explain the property of being attributively\ngood. So, regardless of which normative property of responses FA\ntheories appeal to, they have the potential to unify these different\nvarieties of value. And since it\u2019s plausible that different\nvarieties of value must have something in common in virtue of which\nthey all qualify as varieties of value, it\u2019s an\nadvantage of FA theories that they\u2019re able to explain what this\nis\u2014viz., that each can be fully explained in terms of facts\ninvolving normative properties of responses to be had by certain sets\nof agents\u2014while also respecting the real, important differences\nbetween the kinds of value in question.\n\nAnd FA theories also seem able, similarly, to unify the variety of\nspecific evaluative properties that populate the evaluative domain,\ne.g., that of being admirable, delightful, praiseworthy, etc. For\nassuming that, for each such property, facts involving it can be\nexplained in terms of facts involving a certain normative property of\na certain type of response, FA theorists can claim that this is what\nall such properties have in common, while also properly distinguishing\namong them according to the particular type of response that they\nappeal to in their explanation of each. And, according to some, there\nare likewise prospects for applying FA theories to so-called\n\u201cthick\u201d evaluative properties, such as that of being\ncourageous and kind (for extensive discussion, see Rowland 2019, ch.\n9). If so, FA theories stand to provide unifying explanations not just\nof proper subsets of evaluative properties, but of all such\nproperties. Indeed, the most ambitious FA theorists might claim that\nall evaluative properties have in common that they can each be\naccounted for in terms of a certain normative property of a certain\ntype of human response.\n",
