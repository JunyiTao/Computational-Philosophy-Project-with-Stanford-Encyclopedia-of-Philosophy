    "main_text": "The Neuroscience of Ethics\n3. The Neuroscience of Ethics\n\nNeuroscience, or more broadly the cognitive and neural sciences, have\nmade significant inroads into understanding the neural basis of\nethical thought and social behavior. In the last decades, these fields\nhave begun to flesh out the neural machinery underlying human\ncapacities for moral judgment, altruistic action, and the moral\nemotions (Liao, 2016). The field of social neuroscience, nonexistent\ntwo decades ago, is thriving, and our understanding of the circuitry,\nthe neurochemistry, and the modulatory influences underlying some of\nour most complex and nuanced interpersonal behaviors is growing\nrapidly. Neuroethics recognizes that the heightened understanding of\nthe biological bases of social and moral behaviors can itself have\neffects on how we conceptualize ourselves as social and moral agents,\nand foresees the importance of the interplay between our scientific\nconception of ourselves and our ethical views and theories (Roskies,\n2002). The interplay and its effects provide\u00a0reason to view the\nneuroscience of ethics (or more broadly, of sociality) as part of the\ndomain of neuroethics.\n\nPerhaps the most well-known and controversial example of such an\ninterplay marks the beginning of this kind of exploration. In 2001,\nJoshua Greene scanned people while they made a series of moral and\nnonmoral decisions in different scenarios, including dilemmas modeled\non the philosophical \u201cTrolley Problem\u201d (Thomson, 1985). He\nnoted systematic differences in the engagement of brain regions\nassociated with moral processing in \u201cpersonal\u201d as opposed\nto \u201cimpersonal\u201d moral dilemmas and hypothesized that\nemotional interference was behind the differential reaction times in\njudgments of permissibility in the footbridge case. In later work, he\nproposed a dual-process model of moral judgment, where relatively\nautomatic emotion-based reactions and high-level cognitive control\njointly determined responses to moral dilemmas, and he related his\nfindings to philosophical moral theories (Greene, 2004, 2008). Most\ncontroversially, he suggested that there are reasons to be suspicious\nof our deontological judgments, and interpreted his work as lending\ncredence to utilitarian theories (Greene 2013). Greene\u2019s work is\nthus a clear example of how neuroscience might affect our ethical\ntheorizing. Claims regarding the import of neuroscience studies for\nphilosophical questions have sparked a heated debate in philosophy and\nbeyond, and prompted critiques and replies from scholars both within\nand outside of philosophy (see, e.g. Berker, 2009; Kahane, 2011;\nChristensen, 2014). One effect of these exchanges is to highlight a\nproblematic tendency for scientists and some philosophers to think\nthey can draw normative conclusions from purely descriptive data;\nanother is to illuminate the ways in which descriptive data might\nitself masquerade as normative (Roskies, forthcoming).\n\nGreene\u2019s early studies demonstrated that neuroscience can be\nused in the service of examining extremely high-level behaviors and\ncapacities, and have served as an inspiration for numerous other\nexperiments investigating the neural basis of social and moral\nbehavior and competences (May et al., forthcoming). Neuroethics has\nalready turned its attention to phenomena such as altruism, empathy,\nwell-being, and theory of mind, as well as to disorders such as autism\nand psychopathy. The relevant works range from imaging studies using a\nvariety of imaging techniques, to manipulation of hormones and\nneurochemicals, to purely behavioral studies, and the use of virtual\nreality. In addition, interest in moral and social neuroscience has\ncollided synergistically with the growth of neuroeconomics, which has\nflourished in large part independently. A recent bibliography has\ncollected almost 400 references to works in the neuroscience of ethics\nsince 2002 (Darragh et al., 2015). We can safely assume that many more\nadvances will be made in the years to come, and that neuroethicists\nwill be called upon to advance, evaluate, expound upon, or deflate\nclaims for the purported ethical implications of our new\nknowledge.\n",
