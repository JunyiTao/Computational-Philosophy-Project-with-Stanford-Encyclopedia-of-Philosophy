    "main_text": "Kinds of Reparations\n4. Kinds of Reparations\n\n\nKinds of reparations are at least two in number: compensatory, as\ndiscussed above, and non-compensatory. In either case, reparations are\nto be understood as matters of rights to those wrongfully harmed by a\ngroup or a state. However, while compensatory reparations amount to\nrights to monetary compensation paid by a responsible party to those\nthey have harmed, as discussed in section 4 above, non-compensatory\nreparations constitute rights to enactments of social justice in\nnon-monetary forms such as the removal of symbols of injustice from\nofficial governmental spaces, the accurate teaching of history of a\nsociety in non-exclusionary terms, etc. (Corlett 2010: 1-17). In either\ncase, reparations can serve as a condition of an apology with an eye\ntoward social forgiveness and reconciliation (Corlett 2010:\n187\u2013212).\n",
