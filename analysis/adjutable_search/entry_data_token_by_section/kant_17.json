    "main_text": "The highest good and practical postulates || The highest good\n6.1 The highest good\n\nIn the previous section we saw that, on Kant\u2019s view, the moral\nlaw is a purely formal principle that commands us to act only on\nmaxims that have what he calls lawgiving form, which maxims have only\nif they can be willed as universal laws. Moreover, our fundamental\nreason for choosing to act on such maxims should be that they have\nthis lawgiving form, rather than that acting on them would achieve\nsome end or goal that would satisfy a desire (5:27). For example, I\nshould help others in need not, at bottom, because doing so would make\nme feel good, even if it would, but rather because it is right; and it\nis right (or permissible) to help others in need because this maxim\ncan be willed as a universal law.\n\nAlthough Kant holds that the morality of an action depends on the form\nof its maxim rather than its end or goal, he nevertheless claims both\nthat every human action has an end and that we are unavoidably\nconcerned with the consequences of our actions (4:437; 5:34;\n6:5\u20137, 385). This is not a moral requirement but simply part of\nwhat it means to be a rational being. Moreover, Kant also holds the\nstronger view that it is an unavoidable feature of human reason that\nwe form ideas not only about the immediate and near-term consequences\nof our actions, but also about ultimate consequences. This is the\npractical manifestation of reason\u2019s general demand for what Kant\ncalls \u201cthe unconditioned\u201d\n (5:107\u2013108).[23]\n In particular, since we naturally have desires and inclinations, and\nour reason has \u201ca commission\u201d to attend to the\nsatisfaction of our desires and inclinations, on Kant\u2019s view we\nunavoidably form an idea of the maximal satisfaction of all our\ninclinations and desires, which he calls happiness (5:61, 22, 124).\nThis idea is indeterminate, however, since nobody can know \u201cwhat\nhe really wishes and wills\u201d and thus what would make him\ncompletely happy (4:418). We also form the idea of a moral world or\nrealm of ends, in which everyone acts only in accordance with maxims\nthat can be universal laws (A808/B836, 4:433ff.).\n\nBut neither of these ideas by itself expresses our unconditionally\ncomplete end, as human reason demands in its practical use. A\nperfectly moral world by itself would not constitute our \u201cwhole\nand complete good [\u2026] even in the judgment of an impartial\nreason,\u201d because it is human nature also to need happiness\n(5:110, 25). And happiness by itself would not be unconditionally\ngood, because moral virtue is a condition of worthiness to be happy\n(5:111). So our unconditionally complete end must combine both virtue\nand happiness. In Kant\u2019s words, \u201cvirtue and happiness\ntogether constitute possession of the highest good in a person, and\nhappiness distributed in exact proportion to morality (as the worth of\na person and his worthiness to be happy) constitutes the highest\ngood of a possible world\u201d (5:110\u2013111). It is this\nideal world combining complete virtue with complete happiness that\nKant normally has in mind when he discusses the highest good.\n\nKant says that we have a duty to promote the highest good, taken in\nthis sense (5:125). He does not mean, however, to be identifying some\nnew duty that is not derived from the moral law, in addition to all\nthe particular duties we have that are derived from the moral\n law.[24]\n For example, he is not claiming that in addition to my duties to help\nothers in need, not to commit theft, etc., I also have the additional\nduty to represent the highest good as the final end of all moral\nconduct, combined with happiness, and to promote that end. Rather, as\nwe have seen, Kant holds that it is an unavoidable feature of human\nreasoning, instead of a moral requirement, that we represent all\nparticular duties as leading toward the promotion of the highest good.\nSo the duty to promote the highest good is not a particular duty at\nall, but the sum of all our duties derived from the moral law \u2013\nit \u201cdoes not increase the number of morality\u2019s duties but\nrather provides these with a special point of reference for the\nunification of all ends\u201d (6:5). Nor does Kant mean that anyone\nhas a duty to realize or actually bring about the highest good through\ntheir own power, although his language sometimes suggests this (5:113,\n122). Rather, at least in his later works Kant claims that only the\ncommon striving of an entire \u201cethical community\u201d can\nactually produce the highest good, and that the duty of individuals is\nto promote (but not single-handedly produce) this end with all of\ntheir strength by doing what the moral law commands (6:97\u201398,\n 390\u2013394).[25]\n\nFinally, according to Kant we must conceive of the highest good as a\npossible state of affairs in order to fulfill our duty to promote it.\nHere Kant does not mean that we unavoidably represent the highest good\nas possible, since his view is that we must represent it as possible\nonly if we are to fulfill our duty of promoting it, and yet we may\nfail at doing our duty. Rather, we have a choice about whether to\nconceive of the highest good as possible, to regard it as impossible,\nor to remain noncommittal (5:144\u2013145). But we can fulfill our\nduty of promoting the highest good only by choosing to conceive of the\nhighest good as possible, because we cannot promote any end without\nbelieving that it is possible to achieve that end (5:122). So\nfulfilling the sum of all moral duties to promote the highest good\nrequires believing that a world of complete virtue and happiness is\nnot simply \u201ca phantom of the mind\u201d but could actually be\nrealized (5:472).\n",
