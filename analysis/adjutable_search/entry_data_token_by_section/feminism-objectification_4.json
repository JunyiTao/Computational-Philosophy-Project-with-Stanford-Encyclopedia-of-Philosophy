The possibility of positive objectification\n\nSo far, we have looked at various concerns regarding the wrongness\ninvolved in objectification. A number of thinkers, however, have\nchallenged the idea that objectification is always morally\nproblematic.\n\nAlan Soble questions the widely held Kantian view according to which\nhuman dignity is something that people have. He argues that\nobjectification is not inappropriate. Everyone is already only an\nobject and being only an object is not necessarily a bad thing. In one\nsense, then, no one can be objectified because no one has the higher\nontological status that is required to be reduce-able by\nobjectification. In another sense, everyone is vulnerable to\nobjectification, and everyone can and may be objectified, because to\ndo so is to take them to their correct ontological level. He\nwrites:\n\nThe claim that we should treat people as \u2018persons\u2019 and not\ndehumanise them is to reify, is to anthropomorphise humans and\nconsider them more than they are. Do not treat people as objects, we\nare told. Why not? Because, goes the answer, people qua persons\ndeserve not to be treated as objects. What a nice bit of illusory\nchauvinism. People are not as grand as we make them out to be, would\nlike them to be, or hope them to be. (Soble 2002b, 53\u20134)\n\n\nIn the case of pornography, then, there is nothing wrong, according to\nSoble, with treating pornographic actors and models as objects for\nsexual pleasure and deny their humanity. That is because there is no\nnegative objectification that needs to be taken into moral account.\nSoble adds that pornography\u2019s task is in fact a good one;\npornography takes these people (both men and women), who according to\nhim are good at sex, and makes sure that they do something with their\nlives (Soble 2002b).\n\nLeslie Green is another thinker who argues that it is permissible and\nalso required to treat people as objects. As Green explains, people\nare embodied, extended in space, they exist in time, and they are\nsubject to the laws of nature. People, however, are clearly more than\nobjects. What is problematic therefore, according to Green, is to\ntreat a person merely as an object, merely as a means to\none\u2019s own ends. We can treat other people as means only if we at\nthe same time respect their integrity as agents with their own\npurposes (Green 2000, 44).\n\nGreen points to Kant\u2019s Categorical Imperative, according to\nwhich the prohibition is against treating a person merely\nas means, and not at the same time as an end. As Green\nemphasises, there is no prohibition against treating a person as a\nmeans (as an instrument) (Green 2000, 44). In fact, Green holds,\n\u201cwe must treat others as instruments, for we need their skills,\ntheir company, and their bodies\u2014in fact, there is little that we\nsocial creatures can do on our own, and so little that is\nfulfilling\u201d (Green 2000, 45\u20136). According to Green, when\npeople are old, severely disabled, or chronically unemployed what they\nfear the most is that they no longer are of use to others. As Green\nputs it, \u201cthey miss not only their diminished agency, but also\ntheir diminished objectivity. \u2026 They become \u2026\nsubjectified\u201d (Green 2000, 46).\n\nMartha Nussbaum too aims to challenge the widely-held idea that\nobjectification is inconsistent with respect for a person\u2019s\nhumanity. She offers a systematic analysis of objectification, a\nconcept not at all easy to define and one that writers on the topic\nhave not sufficiently clarified, as she acknowledges (Nussbaum 1995,\n251).\n\nObjectification, for Nussbaum is the seeing and/or treating a person\nas an object; it involves treating one thing as another: one is\ntreating as an object what in fact is not an object, but a human being\n(Nussbaum 1995, 256\u20137). Nussbaum, then, disagrees with\nGreen\u2019s view that people are partly objects. According to\nNussbaum, there are seven features involved in the idea of\nobjectification: instrumentality, denial of autonomy, inertness,\nfungibility, violability, ownership, denial of subjectivity. A\ndetailed exposition of these seven features is provided in the\nintroduction of this entry.\n\nAccording to Nussbaum, a person is objectified when they are seen\nand/or treated in one or more of the above seven ways.\nInstrumentality, then, Nussbaum points out, the core notion of\nKant\u2019s, MacKinnon\u2019s, Dworkin\u2019s, as well as\nGreen\u2019s conceptions of objectification, is only one of the ways\na person can be treated as an object. (Nussbaum does believe, however,\nthat, among these seven notions, instrumentality is especially\nproblematic, and is often linked to other forms of objectification\n(Nussbaum 1995, 265)). Nussbaum\u2019s conception of objectification,\nthen, is broader than Kant/MacKinnon/Dworkin\u2019s because\nobjectification for Nussbaum is not merely defined in terms of\ninstrumentalisation, and also because it can take place when a person\nis only seen, but not treated, as an object (seen in one or\nmore of the above seven ways that she mentions).\n\nAccording to Nussbaum, objectification need not have devastating\nconsequences to a person\u2019s humanity. In fact, Nussbaum\ncriticises MacKinnon and Dworkin for conceiving of objectification as\na necessarily negative phenomenon (Nussbaum 1995, 273). Nussbaum\nbelieves that it is possible that \u201csome features of\nobjectification\u2026 may in fact in some circumstances\u2026 be\neven wonderful features of sexual life\u201d, and so \u201cthe term\nobjectification can also be used\u2026 in a more positive spirit.\nSeeing this will require \u2026 seeing how the allegedly impossible\ncombination between (a form of) objectification and equality, respect,\nand consent might after all be possible\u201d (Nussbaum 1995,\n251).\n\nAccording to Nussbaum, then: \u201cIn the matter of objectification\ncontext is everything. \u2026 in many if not all cases, the\ndifference between an objectionable and a benign use of\nobjectification will be made by the overall context of the human\nrelationship\u201d (Nussbaum 1995, 271); \u201c\u2026\nobjectification has features that may be either good or bad, depending\nupon the overall context\u201d (Nussbaum 1995, 251). Objectification\nis negative, when it takes place in a context where equality,\nrespect and consent are absent. Among the negative objectification\ncases she discusses in her article are Hankinson\u2019s Isabelle\nand Veronique, the magazine Playboy, and James\u2019s\nThe Golden Bowl. And it is benign/positive, when it\nis compatible with equality, respect and consent. Nussbaum gives an\nexample of benign objectification: \u201cIf I am lying around with my\nlover on the bed, and use his stomach as a pillow there seems to be\nnothing at all baneful about this, provided that I do so with his\nconsent (or, if he is asleep, with a reasonable belief that he would\nnot mind), and without causing him pain, provided as well, that I do\nso in the context of a relationship in which he is generally treated\nas more than a pillow\u201d (Nussbaum 1995, 265).\n\nNussbaum believes that \u2018Lawrentian objectification\u2019\n(objectification occurring between the lovers in D. H.\nLawrence\u2019s novels) is a clear example of positive\nobjectification. The passage from Lady Chatterley\u2019s\nLover that she quotes in her article describes a sex scene\nbetween two lovers. Connie and Mellors, in a context characterised by\nrough social equality and respect, identify each other with their body\nparts, they \u201c\u2026 put aside their individuality and become\nidentified with their bodily organs. They see one another in terms of\nthose organs\u201d (Nussbaum 1995, 275). Consequently, the two lovers\ndeny each other\u2019s autonomy and subjectivity, when engaging in\nthe sex act.\n\nHowever, Nussbaum explains, \u201cwhen there is loss of autonomy in\nsex, the context is\u2026 one in which on the whole, autonomy is\nrespected and promoted. \u2026 Again, when there is loss of\nsubjectivity in the moment of lovemaking, this can be and frequently\nis accompanied by an intense concern for the subjectivity of the\npartner at other moments\u2026\u201d (Nussbaum 1995, 274\u20136).\nAs Nussbaum also emphasises in her latest essay on objectification, a\nperson\u2019s \u201cchosen resignation of autonomous self-direction,\nor her willed passivity may be compatible with, and even a valued part\nof, a relationship in which the woman is treated as an end for her own\nsake\u2026 as a full fledged human being\u201d (Nussbaum 2007, 51).\nFurthermore, Connie and Mellors do not treat each other merely as\nmeans for their purposes, according to Nussbaum. Even though they\ntreat each other as tools for sexual pleasure, they generally regard\neach other as more than that. The two lovers, then, are equal and they\ntreat one another as objects in a way that is consistent with\nrespecting each other as human beings.\n\nNussbaum\u2019s list of the seven features involved in\nobjectification and the relations that exist between them provides\nperhaps the most systematic analysis of the concept of objectification\nto date. But Papadaki has argued that Nussbaum\u2019s conception is\ntoo broad (Papadaki 2010a). A person is objectified, according to\nNussbaum, if they are seen and/or treated as an object (in one or more\nof the seven ways that she mentions). If every time a person is\ntreated (or merely seen) by another, say, as an instrument (not a\nmere instrument) for some further purpose, we take it that\nthe person in question is objectified, then it seems that in our daily\nlives we objectify nearly everyone, including ourselves. Inevitably,\nwe use each other and ourselves instrumentally all the time (for\ninstance, I use a taxi driver as a means to get to my destination, I\nuse myself as a means to prepare a meal, etc). Papadaki argues that if\nobjectification is to be a meaningful concept, we need to restrict it.\nHalwani is also in favor of a narrower conception of objectification.\nHe argues that we are better off with a definition of objectification\nthat includes \u201conly treatment or behavior towards\nsomeone\u201d. According to this view, if someone merely sees or\nregards another in a sexual way, there is no objectification. Such a\ndefinition, Halwani suggests, \u201c\u2026is less cluttered and\nmore accurately reflects the problem with objectification: its impact\non the objectified (often thought as victims)\u201d (Halwani\n2008, 342 and Halwani 2010, 187\u20138). He believes that we are\nbetter off arguing that, in Nussbaum\u2019s positive objectification\ncases, there is no objectification to begin with. This is better than\n\u201cengaging in mental gymnastics to try to show that there is\nobjectification but that it is okay or good\u201d (Halwani 2010,\n197). Nussbaum herself seems to be concerned, at times, about her\nobjectification category being too inclusive. For example, she states\nthat sometimes we do not treat the occurrence of only one of the seven\nnotions on her list as sufficient for objectification (Nussbaum 1995,\n258). However, Papadaki suggests, she does not give us enough guidance\nas to how we can decide whether objectification is present when a\nperson is treated in one of the seven ways she mentions. In addition,\nshe suggests that once objectification\u2019s association with the\nmorally problematic is weakened, there is the risk that the fight\nagainst (negative) objectification might be undermined (Papadaki\n2010a, 27\u201331).\n",
