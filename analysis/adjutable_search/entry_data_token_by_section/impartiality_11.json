    "main_text": "Impartiality: Its demands and scope || The cognitive challenge of impartiality\n5.1 The cognitive challenge of impartiality\n\nIn addition to objections directed specifically toward\nconsequentialist or deontological conceptions of impartiality, there\nare also objections aimed at the very idea that impartiality ought to\nbe viewed as fundamental to morality. Some would argue that\nimpartiality, as conceived by traditional ethical theories, makes\nextraordinary and unreasonable cognitive demands on moral agents. This\nworry must be distinguished from the objection to consequentialist\nimpartiality considered earlier, which claimed that the\nsacrifices demanded by consequentialist impartiality were\nunreasonable and excessive. The objection now being considered is not\nthat impartiality asks the agent to give up too much, but rather that\nthe cognitive feats demanded by these moral theories will exceed the\ncapacity of the typical moral agent. Indeed, one popular version of\nthis objection alleges that an agent will require an unreasonable\namount of knowledge or cognitive ability simply to be able to identify\nwhat the demands of impartiality are (Friedman 1989; Walker\n1991). Given the conception of the impartial point of view as a\n\u2018God\u2019s eye\u2019 point of view, for example (Baier 1958),\nit seems questionable whether it is ever reasonable to expect a human\nmoral agent to be able to occupy such a perspective. God, quite\nobviously, possesses far more knowledge than does any human being;\nmoreover, God\u2019s point of view is both objective and impersonal\nin ways that an individual human\u2019s perspective cannot be. (As\nMargaret Urban Walker points out, it is often said that human beings\nhave to live with their decisions, but it sounds very odd to say that\nof God (Walker 1991, 765).)\n\nSimilar remarks apply to the conception of the impartial point of view\nas \u2018the point of view of the universe\u2019 (Sidgwick 1907), to\nHare\u2019s conception of the ideal moral agent as a so-called\n\u2018archangel\u2019 (Hare, 1981), and, Walker claims, to\nFirth\u2019s conception of the ideal impartial observer (Firth,\n1952.) Similarly, Marilyn Friedman points out that even if a person\ndid manage to occupy such a point of view for a period of time \u2013\nsupposing such a thing to be possible \u2013 there would be no way to\nbe certain that she had successfully done so: standard conceptions of\nimpartiality, she claims, prescribe \u201cmethods of normative\nthinking [which] represent psychological and epistemic feats, the\nachievement of which we have no independent way to confirm\u201d\n(Friedman 1991, 645).\n",
