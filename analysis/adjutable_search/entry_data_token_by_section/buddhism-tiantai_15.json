Tiantai meditation most centrally applies a method\ncalled \u201cthe contemplation of mind\u201d, (\u89c0\u5fc3\nguanxin) given its most famous formulation in Zhiyi\u2019s\nunfolding of \u4e00\u5ff5\u4e09\u5343 yiniansanqian\n(Japanese: ichinensanzen), which means something like: \u201cOne\nMoment of Experience as Three Thousand Worlds\u201d. The \u201cthree\nthousand\u201d is of course a way of saying \u201ceverything\u201d,\nbut it is really something a bit more than that. For of course, as\nZhiyi himself points out, any number would be an equally accurate\npossible way to talk about the totality of all things, from none to\ninfinity. This number, \u201cthree thousand\u201d, is concocted\nspecifically with meditational practice in mind. Here\u2019s how\nit\u2019s derived:\n\n\n\nTen Realms \u00d7\nTen Realms \u00d7\nTen Suchnesses \u00d7\nThree Worlds=3000 \n\nBuddhahood\nBuddhahood\nAppearance\nFive Aggregates \n\nBodhisattva\nBodhisattva\nNature\n \n\nPratyekabuddha[1]\nPratyekabuddha\nComponents\n \n\nSravaka[2]\nSravaka\nCapability\n \n\nGods\nGods\nAction\nSentient Beings \n\nHumans\nHumans\nCauses\n \n\nAsuras[3]\nAsuras\nConditions\n \n\nAnimals\nAnimals\nEffects\n \n\nHungry Ghosts\nHungry Ghosts\nConsequences\nEnvironment\n \n\nPurgatories\nPurgatories\nUltimate Equality and Equal Ultimacy\n  \n\n\nPlease note a few peculiarities of this way of listing \u201cwhat\nexists\u201d. First, special care is taken here to include both\n\u201cpurgatories\u201d (i.e., the demonic thoughts,\npractices and consequences of extreme subjective delusion and\nsuffering) on the one hand, and \u201cBuddhas\u201d, (the\nenlightened thoughts, practices and consequences of the greatest\nwisdom and liberation) on the other hand. This is important, because\nit cautions us against viewing these subjective states, good or evil,\nas mere epiphenenomena that are somehow outside the ultimate reality.\nThey are themselves included in the ultimate reality. By including\nthese terms, Tiantai guards against a vague notion of\n\u201ceverything\u201d which might lend itself to thinking that only\na pure or neutral substance\u2014mind, matter, energy\u2014is what\nis real, or that the values and perspectives, good and bad, painful\nand pleasant, that living beings experience are not part of the\n\u201ceverything\u201d. The \u201ceverything\u201d that is\nincluded in each moment of experience, and which is eternally\nineradicable, includes all those good and bad subjective states as\nwell.\n\nSecond, we have two important reduplications. The ten realms are all\nthe states in which a sentient being might find him or herself in the\nBuddhist universe, from the lowest ignorance and suffering to the\nhighest bliss and enlightenment. They are often interpreted\nsymbolically: Buddhahood representing a moment of enlightened\nexperience, Bodhisattvahood a moment of compassion, Sravakahood a\nmoment of quiescence or renunciation of the worldly, Godhood a moment\nof great worldly bliss and power, Asurahood a moment of egoistic rage\nand combativeness, animals ignorance, purgatories suffering. One\nreason to read these as states that any being might undergo is that\neach of the ten realms is listed twice. This is because each realm\n\u201cincludes\u201d or \u201cinstantiates\u201d all the other ten\nrealms. That is, each can appear \u201cas\u201d any of the others,\nand in fact nothing appears which is not always \u201cas\u201d\nsomething else. A human-bodhisattva, an animal-god, a Buddha-demon, an\nAsura-Sravaka, etc. A bodhisattva appears as a human, or an animal, or\na Buddha, or an Asura. But as we\u2019ve seen, this also means a\nhuman appears as a bodhisattva, or a demon as an animal, or a Sravaka\nas a hungry ghost, etc. Of course this goes on ad infinitum:\neach of these included realms further includes all ten realms, and so\non. The 10 times 10 is just to point to this factor of mutual\ninclusion, and make sure it is accounted for in our meditative\ncontemplation of \u201cwhat exists\u201d.\n\nThe other duplication comes in the \u201cThree Worlds\u201d. We have\n\u201cthe five aggregates\u201d but also \u201csentient\nbeings\u201d. Actually, these are two ways of looking at the same\nthing. Early Buddhism taught that what we call a sentient\nbeing\u2014you, me, Bill, Dave\u2014is actually a set of five\naggregates, momentarily arising and perishing impersonal processes of\nform, sensation, perception, volition and consciousness. One (the\naggregates) was real, the other (the alleged \u201cself\u201d) was a\npernicious illusion. The Three Thousand includes both. In other words,\nit does not exclude the illusions about things among the totality of\n\u201cwhat exists\u201d\u2014as we\u2019ve seen, all things are\nequally illusions and equally true. The view of you as Bill is one\nitem in the list; the view of you as five impersonal aggregate\nprocesses is another item on the list. Here too we have a shorthand\nway of pointing to a larger principle, and a goad to keep it in mind\nin our contemplation of \u201call that exists\u201d. We are not to\nthink of a set of real entities lined up side by side, mutually\nexclusive, of which there may be some additional erroneous views.\nRather, the erroneous view are part of all that exists, indeed all\nthat exists is some erroneous (i.e., one-sided, locally coherent)\nview. There is no \u201cthing\u201d as such: a thing is just a way\nof appearing, and comes with a viewpoint upon it. Tiantai insists\nfurther that to have a single viewpoint requires at least one\nadditional viewpoint, and so ad infinitum. Normally we drain\noff the ambiguity and call it \u201csubjectivity\u201d or\n\u201cfree will\u201d or \u201cthe unknown future\u201d to one\nside and leave the \u201creality\u201d on the other side, calling it\n\u201cobjectivity\u201d or \u201cdeterminate fact\u201d or\n\u201cthe settled past\u201d. In Tiantai, these are inseparable,\nmerely aspects artificially separated off from the whole, which is\nalways both fixed and open, locally coherent and globally\nincoherent.\n\nThe locus classicus of the above enumeration is Zhiyi\u2019s\ndefinitive work on meditation, Mohezhiguan\n(\u6469\u8a36\u6b62\u89c0), where it is presented as a\ndescription of \u201cthe realm of what is conceivable.\u201d The\ntext walks us through all possible objects of experience this way, one\nby one, almost in the manner of a list out of Walt Whitman\u2019s\nLeaves of Grass, while also adducing these multiperspectival\nreduplications that result from their mutual subsumptions, a\nconsequence of the ontological ambiguity attributed to all entities on\nthe theoretical level by Zhiyi\u2019s doctrine of the Three Truths.\nHis reason for presenting the exposition in this manner, he tells us,\nis because the real topic of interest here, which he calls \u201cthe\nrealm of the Inconceivable,\u201d the proposed object of the central\nTiantai contemplation, is difficult to present directly in theoretical\nterms: it can be disclosed only through first describing the\ncontrasting realm of the \u201cconceivable\u201d as a foil. Once\nthis enumeration of what is conceivable is completed, the actual\nreferent of the term \u201cthe realm of the Inconceivable\u201d is\nat last presented. It turns out to be any single instant of\nexperience, fleetingly arising through the conditional conjunction of\ncognitive organ and cognitive object\u2014that is, what every\nsentient being is experiencing at every moment. Why does Zhiyi\nsuddenly direct us to consider a momentary mental event, an instant of\nexperience that arises and perishes in the blink of an eye, at this\nparticular juncture? The neither-same-nor-different ontological\nambiguity of the Three Truths applies to this entity as well, but now\nthe task is to realize this in meditational practice rather than only\nin theory. To describe what this involves, Zhiyi then asserts, rather\nabruptly, that if there is the arising of the slightest wisp of any\nexperience at all, all the above enumerated Three Thousand are at once\nboth inherently entailed in it \u5177 and also, as he goes on to\nexplain, strictly identical to it \u5373\u2014a way of saying\n\u201care neither the same nor different from it\u201d\n(\u82e5\u7121\u5fc3\u800c\u5df1\uff0c\u4ecb\u723e\u6709\u5fc3\uff0c\u5373\u5177\u4e09\u5343).\nFor an English translation of the passage in question, see Swanson\n2018, Volume 2, pp. 795\u2014836, especially pp. 815\u20136.\n\nTo see what this means and how it is to be actually experienced\nrequires careful unpacking. Tiantai meditation practice represents a\nsurprising and innovative repurposing of certain earlier Buddhist\nmotifs, just as the Tiantai doctrinal positions do. In this case, the\nkey motif to be repurposed is the pan-Buddhist emphasis on the\nimpermanence of mental states. Here this view is pushed to the\nextreme, also found in many earlier schools, of regarding apparent all\nmental continuity as a misperception of what is really a succession of\nradically distinct and extremely brief moments of mental activity. The\ntraditional Buddhist emphasis on the sole reality of the present\ninstant of experience is also radicalized in this move and, in a\ntypical Tiantai manner that by now should seem familiar, both of these\nfamiliar Buddhist claims are thereby repurposed and even reversed, as\nwe shall see.\n\nThe procedure boils down to fomenting a direct phenomenological\nexperience of the meaning of \u201cneither same nor different\u201d\nwith respect to any fleeting moment of experience. The great Song\ndynasty Tiantai thinker Siming Zhili puts it well, summarizing the\nmechanism of the Tiantai \u201ccontemplation of mind\u201d procedure\nwhile also dispelling the idealist misunderstanding that takes it to\nimply a special ontological status for mind as opposed to matter:\n\u201cWe must understand that it is because all [the many elements of\nexperience] share the same nature that they can together dwell in one\nsingle instant of experience. Their dwelling together as one single\ninstant of experience is used to reveal this shared nature. This does\nnot mean we are pointing to the moment of experience [i.e., mental\nactivity, as opposed to material things] itself as their true\nnature.\u201d\n(\u9808\u77e5\u540c\u4e00\u6027\u6545\u3002\u65b9\u80fd\u540c\u5c45\u4e00\u5ff5\u6545\u3002\n\u4ee5\u540c\u5c45\u4e00\u5ff5\u7528\u986f\u540c\u4e00\u771f\u6027\u3002\u975e\u8b02\u4fbf\u5c07\u4e00\u5ff5\u540d\u70ba\u771f\u6027.\n\u2014 \u77e5\u79ae\uff0c\u300c\u5341\u4e0d\u4e8c\u9580\u6307\u8981\u9214\u300d\uff0c\u5377\u4e00) The\n\u201cshared nature\u201d of all phenomena referred to here,\nrevealed by their dwelling together in a single instant, is not the\nnature of mind, or impermanence, or momentariness: it is the Three\nTruths, Emptiness qua Provisional Positing qua Centrality, local\ncoherence qua global incoherence qua intersubsumption, which amounts\nto the apprehension of all elements of experience as \u201cneither\nsame nor different.\u201d Here we are to directly observe what\n\u201cneither same nor different,\u201d which is the nature of all\nphenomena, means as manifest in every single moment of experience, for\nit is their ability to \u201cdwell together\u201d in (or as) a\nsingle moment that reveals this nature.\n\nTo accomplish this, according to the account given in Tiantai texts,\nwe must first apprehend the instant of experience itself as a\nsingle whole. That means to see all the elements of this\nmoment\u2019s experience as mental experience, but\nspecifically as a single mental experience, in which all\nthese elements are simultaneously present, related to one another in a\nspecific instantaneous structure. This requires some training in\nattentiveness to all elements of a single moment equally; the normally\nneglected aspects of a single moment\u2019s experience, its\nperipheral or indistinct elements, are laid out in the above\nenumeration of every possible state one can think of, as a way of\ntrying to reach into every nook and cranny of what one means by\n\u201ceverything that I can think of right now.\u201d This includes\nboth the knower and the known, as well as whatever way the division\nbetween them presents itself. For although the knower is not present\nin the same way other objects of experience are, its presence is felt\nin some form; whatever is apprehensible as the presence of the agent\nof this mentation, the activity that separates itself off from the\nobjective contents, the knower as opposed to the known, as well as the\nact of opposition itself, is also to be included as an aspect or part\nof the world as I know it and imagine it. Also to be included is the\nimagined as well as the perceived, the possible as well as the actual.\nAlso included must be the moment\u2019s sense of its own\ntransitoriness, the sense of being situated between a gone past and\nyet to come future, however these may manifest in the experience. All\nelements perceived or conceived are to be taken in and noted. The next\nstep will be to apprehend these all as felt aspects of a single mental\nevent, a single entity with all these many characteristics in their\nspecific relations of this moment appearing at once, and all\ndisappearing at once, such that not one can be changed or replaced. It\nmust be experienced as a specific total structure of just these\nelements, in just these relations, and none other.\n\nThis endeavor to see the total manifold of contents as a single mental\nevent is meant as a direct way of dispelling the premises of ordinary\n\u201cdeluded\u201d experience. For our ordinary experience is, we\nmay say, premised on a mistaken application of categories derived from\na conception of durational mental and physical objects to fleeting\nexperienced moments themselves, the latter being on this view the real\ncontents of all experience. To be more precise, it must be noted that\ncategories such as \u201csame\u201d and \u201cdifferent,\u201d and\n\u201cwhole\u201d and \u201cpart,\u201d and\n\u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201ccontingent,\u201d and\n\u201cactual\u201d and \u201cpossible,\u201d and \u201cessential\nproperties\u201d and \u201caccidental properties,\u201d actually\napply only to durational objects, whether physical or mental. All of\nthese categories require the comparison of one entity with another,\nwhich cannot be done in the span of an instantaneous upsurge of\nundivided experience.\n\nHow so? Let us start with the most comprehensive of these categories,\nas applied to these single whole moments: are these moments \u201cthe\nsame as\u201d or \u201cdifferent from\u201d one another? Considered\npurely as moments, the answer is \u201cneither.\u201d For it must be\nnoted that the conception of a series of moments laid out in a neutral\ntimeline, seen as a set of derivative entities called moments which\nare somehow laid out in a more basic element (\u201ctime,\u201d\nperhaps, or \u201cnature\u201d) which is not itself a moment, is no\nlonger possible here. If there is no other substratum in which\nanything can exist besides moments of experience, this applies to the\napprehension of \u201cother\u201d moments as well: these\napprehensions of other moments can only exist in some moment. So we\nnow must slightly amend the above claim about the basic constituents,\nand say instead that the most basic elements are not moments, plural,\nas if these were an array of genuinely distinct entities that could\nsomehow be viewed from outside, but simply speak of \u201cthis one\nmoment.\u201d Their plurality exists only from within some specific\nsingle moment. This is why moments cannot be said to simply\n\u201cdifferent\u201d from one another. Yet this impermanent moment\nis not the same as anything else either; it is of the essence of being\na present moment qua moment to be non-identical to other moments,\ni.e., to not-be the past and future moments, and it is the essence of\nexperiencable contents to require contrast to what they are not.\nIndeed, for me to experience the moment as presently occurring at all,\nI must also be experiencing the difference between present\nand not-present in the present; the pastness and futureness\nto which it has to be contrasted to have the quality of being present\nmust in some manner also be present to me. So because we have no\ndurational things, we are radicalizing impermanence, the absolute\ntransitoriness of moments, which points to an absolute difference\nbetween them; but because moments are not like mutually exclusive\nobjects laid side by side in a neutral medium, we have no plurality of\nmoments; their alleged difference is really only each moment\nreappearing in a new form as a component in all other moments, which\nmight be described as each moment\u2019s unceasing transforming\ncontinuance, its radical permanence. Moments are neither the same nor\ndifferent from one another, and thus neither impermanent nor\npermanent, or if we prefer, both impermanent and permanent. It is this\nparadoxical nature of every possible moment of experience that is the\n\u201cthe inconceivable\u201d to be directly realized in Tiantai\ncontemplation.\n\nWhat about the multifarious contents within any one of these\nneither-same-nor-different moments then, the long list of very diverse\nexperienced components of any given moment? These too are\nneither-same-nor-different from one another, within that very moment.\nWe have seen that these single moments of experience are to be viewed\nas indivisible wholes, and that they have no external limits dividing\nthem from other moments that can be observed in a neutral substratum,\nfrom outside the moments themselves. It should be noted that neither\ncan such limits between moments be observed from within any moment,\nfor whatever is observed in a moment is ipso facto within its limits.\nBut what is more surprising is that there are no definite limits even\nbetween the various contents that constitute these moments. They have\nwhat might initially be described as diverse manifold\ncontents\u2014first, the multiple objects of sensory observation that\nare included (chairs and tables, sky and earth, cups and plates,\npeople and trees), but, observing more closely, also\n\u201csubject\u201d and \u201cobject,\u201d \u201cactual\u201d\nand \u201cpossible,\u201d as well as \u201ccenter and periphery,\n(possible) hope and (actual) fear, (possible) pleasure and (actual)\npain, water and mountain\u201d and so on. But properly speaking,\nthese elements are only genuinely \u201cdiverse\u201d if they are\nviewed through the categorial obligations that apply to durational\nobjects, whether physical or mental. These durational things, however,\nare now to be understood as abstract derivatives of moments of\nexperience, rather than the ultimate constituents of reality of which\nmoments of experience are partial apprehensions, as we usually tend to\nbelieve. When viewed on their own terms as moments, the manifold\ncontents are indivisibly present as the moment they constitute, not\nlosing their specific experiential qualities, but not separable into\ndistinct elements that are merely limited \u201cparts\u201d or even\n\u201caspects\u201d of the momentary experience. For we are able to\nidentify distinct \u201cparts\u201d or \u201caspects\u201d in an\nexperienced object only if those parts or aspects can be experienced\nas \u201cthe same\u201d object apart from the whole in which they\nappear, either as isolated entities or as parts or aspects of other\nwholes. This cannot happen with any putative part or aspect of a given\nmoment, for any subsequent appearance of the part or aspect in\nquestion would have to be compared with the part or aspect as it\nappeared in the original moment; but this can only happen in yet\nanother moment, of which both of these instances would in fact be\nparts or aspects. Both moment 1 and moment 2 are now experienced only\nas parts or aspects of moment 3, and the constituent parts or aspects\nof moments 1 and 2 are thus actually component parts or aspects of\nmoment 3. If \u201cpart A\u201d of 1 appears unchanged as\n\u201cpart A\u201d also in moment 2, this tells us only about two\naspects of the indivisible totality of moment 3, nothing about the\nrelation of part A to other parts of moments 1 and 2. For again, there\nis no neutral medium of comparison between two moments.\n\nTo see what is at stake here, we must further consider the derivation\nand entailments of our notion of \u201cdifferent parts or aspects of\na thing\u201d in ordinary consciousness. As I lift my coffee mug to\ntake a sip, my normal consciousness will be tracking certain\ncontinuities, shaped usually by my practical intentions and more\noccasionally by more abstract theoretical considerations. I may see\nthis mug as one in a series of drinking vessels experienced in the\npast; I may think of it as an instance of the general category\n\u201cdrinking vessel.\u201d I may evaluate its effectiveness in\ncontaining the amount of coffee I want to have in one sitting and how\nsmoothly it facilitates delivery of that coffee to my mouth, linking\nit to past and prospective actions and experiences. I may simply think\nof it as a single physical object, an individual substance unifying a\nmanifold of properties such as solidity, color, smoothness, shape. In\neach of these cases, I am making sense of this experienced perception\nof the mug by forefronting its connection with certain other\nperceptions and conceptions, together with which it seems to belong:\nother mugs, the universal concept of drinking vessel, the intention to\ndrink coffee in a few minutes, the properties of solidity and the like\nthat also instantiate in other objects. I will want to distinguish\nbetween which of these connections are necessary and which merely\ncontingent, and my sense-making will be largely dependent on how and\nhow well I do this. If I shift into Tiantai meditation mode, however,\nI am to direct my attention instead to the connection of this\nperception of the mug with everything else going on within this\nmoment of experience. This may include any or all of the above,\nbut viewed as aspects of this moment, alongside everything\nelse in its perceived spatial and temporal surroundings. Viewing that\nmoment as a single indivisible event, I will no longer be able to make\na distinction between necessary and contingent: the moment as a whole\nand every one of its elements are exactly what they are, and cannot be\nany different\u2014for any difference would by definition simply be\nanother moment of experience. To imagine it with any part removed,\nadded or repositioned is simply to be having another moment of\nexperience, not this one. It cannot be compared to another moment to\nsee which parts are permanent and which transitory, which are\nnecessary and essential to its being what it is and which are merely\nadventitious or contingent, for any such comparison would again be the\noccurrence of a different moment. All of it is transitory and every\nconnection equally contingent, but all of it is equally necessarily\njust as it is, none of it can be otherwise than it is. It will\ndefinitely be internally articulated, with what would normally be\ndescribed as portions that are qualitatively distinct from one\nanother, since experienced contrast is necessary to any and all\nperception of qualities, or of any moment occurring at all. But none\nof these elements can be regarded as actually divided into genuinely\n\u201cdifferent portions\u201d of the moment, since none can be\nexperienced without at the same instant experiencing all the\nothers\u2014any act of zeroing in on and \u201cvisiting\u201d one\nwill simply be an additional moment of experience, one that appears as\nan entirely different moment (though of course in the end it too is to\nbe seen as neither-same-nor-different, as already noted); to be\nvisiting one portion is to visit them all.\n\nThis has interesting consequences that pertain also to the devotional\nand ritual aspects of Tiantai practice. Let\u2019s imagine that I am\nthinking about, say, a Buddha; my one instant of experience includes\nan apprehension of both the poor suffering being I am now, along with\nwhatever objects\u2014 the tables and chairs and ceiling and floor,\npossible and actuals, pasts and futures\u2014are within my present\npurview, and also a beatific Buddha somewhere else whom I am not, or\nthe possible existence of such a Buddha, or the Buddha I will\nbe in the future, or even one I might be in the future. As in\nthe case of past, present and future, even to experience myself\nspecifically as not a Buddha is also to be apprehending\nBuddhahood in some mode or form. To see myself as deluded and\nsuffering is to also be experiencing the absence of some contrasting\nstate; in our example, if part of what I think about is how very\nnot a Buddha I presently am (perhaps in the context of a\nrepentance ritual, but also in simply noting the magnitude of my own\ngreed, anger and delusion), then my apprehension also includes this\nBuddhahood in the mode of its not-presence, internal to this present\nmoment just as the sense of contrasting pastness and futureness in\ngeneral always are. But the copresence of both my delusion and\nsuffering and the imagined bliss and wisdom of an imagined Buddha whom\nI am not, both present in this single instant of experience, is not to\nbe imaged like the case of a durational object with two distinct and\nopposed qualities to it, like, for example, a piece of pastry with\nboth a sweet portion and a bitter portion (due to a baking mishap,\nperhaps!). If I bite into this pastry and happen to take in both the\nsweet and the bitter at once, I can conceive of these as genuinely\nseparate because I can compare to other pieces of pastry which are\neither completely sweet or completely bitter, or the sweetness and\nbitterness separated out from all pastry and present in other foods,\nand I can resolve to henceforth, in my next bite, take only the sweet\nand not the bitter, for the pastry will persist through time, waits\nfor me to relate to it in another moment in a potentially different\nway. Alternate ways of experiencing the pastry, or of zeroing in on\none portion rather than another, or comparisons to other experiences,\nare available due to the fact that a durational object is something\nother than the moments of its existence; the different moments of its\nexistence exist in a neutral shared medium, either space and time for\na physical object or, even in the case of a purely mental object, at\nleast time. As we have seen, this is not true for the instant of\nexperience, which shares no neutral medium with other moments; again,\nprecisely because they are themselves nothing but time, two moments of\ntime cannot be compared except in a third moment which differs from\nboth (although this difference is immanent to all three moments, and\ntherefore the two differing terms is immanent to all three\nmoments\u2014and in that sense they do not differ, as we shall see in more\ndetail below). I cannot revisit this moment, and I cannot compare it,\nand I cannot abstract from it. There is never even the possibility of\nan instance of encountering one of these without also encountering the\nother. If I experience both the sweet and the bitter once, however\nfleetingly, though they are both instantly gone in the next moment, in\nanother sense they are eternally together, indeed they are aspects of\na single thing, always and exceptionless encountered together. For in\ngeneral, when we judge two things to be \u201cthe same\u201d we mean\nthat they it is impossible to encounter or even consider one without\nconsidering the other; they are inalienably and always together. When\nI say \u201cwater is the same as H2O,\u201d I mean that\nthese are two names for the same thing: whenever anyone encounters\nwater they are encountering H2O, whenever anyone encounters\nH2O they are encountering water. They would be distinct\nentities only if it is at least conceivable that they can in fact be\nseparated, that one might occur without the other. This also applies\nto different \u201caspects\u201d of a single fact which are always\nencountered together\u2014for example, the pitch and the volume of a\nmusical note. We might think that, although every pitch has a volume\nand every volume has a pitch, so they are always encountered together,\nthey are still meaningfully said to be different aspects because I can\ndistinguish between them, enumerating different parameters and\ncharacteristics of each. But again, this distinguishing of aspects\nhappens only after the initial apprehension of them\ntogether\u2014in a subsequent moment\u2014and depends entirely on the\npossibility that the pitch and the volume can change in different\nways, i.e., that the pitch might remain constant while the volume\nchanges or vice versa. This is not possible when the two are\napprehended only as existing together in a single moment: there is no\npossibility of any change in either of them. The distinguishing of\ndifferent \u201caspects\u201d requires hypostasizing the note as an\nentity with some kind of existence independent of its momentary\nappearance, a durational object of contemplation. The thought about\nthe different aspects of the note belongs to another moment, and is a\nnew object in its own right which belongs inalienably to its moment,\njust as the initial apprehension of the total note, with its exact\npitch and volume and none other, belonged to the first moment. They\ncan only be considered different if they are in principle separable in\nsome way, and that is not the case for the elements of the moment.\nThey are therefore not different from one another.\n\nYet, though I must experience both the Buddhahood and the\nnon-Buddhahood as indivisible components of a single moment, never to\nbe repeated in isolation, it is also true that both are non-different\nfrom every other instance of both Buddhahood and non-Buddahood in all\nother moments. Each is constantly extending itself in an infinity of\nforms, including in the forms of each other. For, as touched on\nbriefly above, to be experienced as \u201coccurring\u201d at all, a\npresent moment must also include within it some sense of the contrast\nto a gone past and a coming future, which thus must also be\napprehended within it somehow. \u201cOther\u201d moments are present\neven in this moment itself \u201cas\u201d the sense of surpassed\npastness and to-come futurity that are the necessary contrasts that\nconstitute its own sense of presentness. The experienced pastness and\nfutureness are thus necessary components of the present qua present,\nbut like any other components, they are not genuinely distinct parts\nor aspects that can be detached from the total moment. This means not\nonly that the present sense of pastness and futureness, like all the\nother components of the present moment, can only be experienced at the\nsame time as all the other components of this single moment, and thus\nare absolutely non-same with anything in any past or future moment.\nBut this also means, conversely, that they are non-different from the\ncontents of every other moment, for the same reasons that the moments\nas wholes are non-different: there is no neutral medium in which to\ncompare them. The distinctness of my present vague intimation of\ntomorrow and the actual events that come to take place tomorrow is as\nimmanent to tomorrow as it is to the present: tomorrow\u2019s\nexperience of disconfirmation of today\u2019s expectation is immanent\nto that moment tomorrow, and experience of this disparity necessarily\nincludes both of the two disparate terms: yesterday\u2019s\nexpectation of the future is thus also an inalienable component of\ntomorrow\u2019s single whole moment in which it is disconfirmed.\nFuture moments when they do occur are neither the same nor different\nfrom the vague representation of the future in the previous moment;\nthey might be seen as absolutely distinct (as in commonsensical views\nof an \u201cimagined\u201d as opposed to a \u201creal\u201d\nfuture), or conversely as further articulations of the previous vague\nintimation; but in fact the \u201cvague intimation of future\u201d\nin question has no fixed nature to be same as or different from,\nprecisely because this element of the present moment, like all the\nother elements, is not really a distinct part or aspect existing\nbeyond the moment in which it occurs, is not a durational entity at\nall, but merely an unrepeatable and indivisible component of a\nparticular moment, neither same nor different from the other\ncomponents of that moment. So we must say the future is neither\ncompletely different from the imagined future contributing to the\ncomposition of a past moment, nor completely identical to that\nimagined future\u2014or if we prefer, both. Thus do we speak of the\npermanence-impermanence, the impermanence-permanence, not only of\nevery moment, but of every component of every moment.\n\nA moment is intrinsically fleeting, gone as soon as it arises. I\ncannot prolong it or remain in it. But note also that, if this moment\nis not characterizable as \u201cdifferent\u201d from any other\nmoment, I also can never actually leave this moment: whatever\nsubsequent moments may appear, they are non-different from this one.\nThis non-difference is apprehended in the single upsurge of the\nunchangeable moment as its own internal sense of its difference from\npast and future moments: they are present there, in some form or\nother, precisely however vaguely or distinctly they are within that\none experience, as inalienable aspects of that moment itself. The next\nmoment, when new contents appear, will be experienced as more\nof or other expressions of the same moment. That moment,\nthough radically impermanent, is thus also experienced as permanent\nand necessary, just like a \u201csubstance\u201d in Spinoza\u2019s\nsense: it can be conceived only as existing, since it just is its\nbeing conceived; and it can only be conceived as existing exactly as\nit does exist; it is infinite and indivisible, since whatever appears\nas its limit or divider is ipso facto internal to it, one more\ncomponent of it, and the conception of only a \u201cpart\u201d of it\nwill simply be by definition a different moment; and by the same\ntoken, it cannot be acted upon by anything external to it, it is\ninfinitely productive, and everything it produces is more of itself.\nThe moment is both radically impermanent and radically eternal. More\nto the point, its impermanence is its permanence, its permanence is\nits impermanence\u2014exactly the claims of Tiantai\u2019s\ntheoretical conclusions. I experience the eternity-temporality of this\nmoment continuing to show itself in and as the\nneither-same-nor-different array of all other possible experiences,\nbeings, ideas, moments. This is mode in which we find the direct\nexperience of Buddhahood-as-all-sentient-beings, and\nall-sentient-beings-as-Buddahood.\n\nSo it is that after gaining some facility in this sort of reduction of\nall time to the present moment and of all concrete and abstract\nobjects as well as subjective states to the single instant of\nexperience, we are to notice how this instantiates, in an immediate\nexperiential way, the \u201cinconceivable\u201d character of all\nphenomenon, which was independently asserted on theoretical grounds in\ndoctrinal writings: we are to notice that neither sameness nor\ndifference applies to the relation between any of the contents of this\nexperience as apprehended above. This applies to the relation of one\nmoment to another, to the relation of the knowing activity and the\nknown objects, and also to the relations among all the many component\nobjects themselves: none are the same as each other, none are\ndifferent from one another. As such, this is a direct experience of\nthe Ultimate Reality of all Phenomena, precisely in the experience of\nthe phenomena themselves in all their distinctness. And in as much as\nthis is simply what is in fact going on in all actual temporal\nexperience, all experience is discovered to be the Ultimate Reality of\nall Phenomena.\n\nThe above gives us a roadmap of the agenda for Tiantai meditation: to\nexperience the Three Thousand as a single moment of experience and\nthus as neither-same-nor-difference both with each other and with that\nmoment as a whole. But how is all of the above actually to be\nrealized, not just conceptually or theoretically, but\nexperientially? Zhiyi does, in that same work, lay out ritual\nprocedures for inducing a direct experience of a single moment as the\ntotality of existence, brilliantly expounding the salvifically\nparadoxical effects this would have, in terms quite resonant to\nwhat we\u2019ve explored above\u2014for example in the section on the\nfirst of the Four Samadhis, the \u201cOne-Practice\nSamadhi.\u201d (See Ziporyn, 2016, pp. 273\u2013275 for an English\ntranslation of this passage; for an alternate translation, see Swanson\n2018, Volume 1, pp. 252\u2013261). Another procedure for isolating\nthe moment, through introspection and analysis, freeze-framing\nit so that one sees \u201cno motion or turning, no source or\ndestination, nowhere it comes from and nowhere it goes to\u201d\n(\u884c\u8005\u5fc3\u6578\u8d77\u6642\uff0c\u8fd4\u7167\u89c0\u5bdf\uff0c\u4e0d\u898b\u52d5\u8f49\u3001\u6839\u6e90\u7d42\u672b\u3001\u4f86\u8655\u53bb\u8655), and\nthen discovering through analysis that no coherent boundaries can be\nfound between this frozen moment and its excluded past and\nfuture, is offered in the \u201cSamadhi of Awareness of One\u2019s Own\nThoughts,\u201d described in the fourth of the Four Samadhis (see Swanson\n2018, pp. 323\u2013386). But in the practice under discussion here,\nsingled out by later tradition as the most central and distinctive\nform of specifically Tiantai meditation, crucially, we are instead not\ninstructed to try to get this done by directly thinking about it or\nwilling it, by attempting to expand our conception of mentation to\ninclude all these contents, to overstep the habitual subject-object\ndivide by fiat, or by the application of the by-now-familiar\ndialectical refutation of the categories of sameness and difference as\nfound in the doctrine of the Three Truths. All of these are here\nregarded as futile; they would still land us in the merely theoretical\nterritory of the \u201cconceivable,\u201d where the habitual\ncategories would automatically reimpose themselves. The attempt to\nunravel these categories deliberately ends up further entangling us in\nthem, for it means trying to attain a new kind of experience or\nconceptualization that is simply \u201cdifferent\u201d from the\nordinary ones\u2014as we found to be unavoidable in the description of\nthese desiderata given in theoretical terms above. These categories of\nsame and different are as deeply embedded in the attempt to dispel\nthem as in that which it attempts to dispel. Rather, the practical\napplication of these ideas is done in precisely the opposite way from\nwhat one might expect: it is done not by deciding to expand our\napprehension of the mind or moment to include all, to view all\nencountered contents as constituents of a single moment of experience,\nand then succeeding in doing so. Rather, it is done precisely by\ntrying to exclude all other experiences from this moment of\nexperience, to dispel them, and then failing to do so. It is\ndone by tracing out and thinking about what the moment includes, but\nmerely by settling our attention on the moment qua moment, on the\nmomentariness of the moment as an instantaneous and unchangeable\nand unrepeatable single flash of experience: on the\ninfinitesimal smallness of its duration, how little is within its\nexpanse, its utter failure to occupy almost all of time and all of\nreality. For it is only thus that one directly experiences all\nexternal time and reality making themselves impossible to exclude,\nexperiencing first-hand the necessity of their inclusion. How so?\n\nAll the various characteristics and relations of things are here to be\napprehended, as we\u2019ve said, as \u201cdwelling together in (or\nas) a single moment of mentation\u201d\n(\u540c\u5c45\u4e00\u5ff5). So far this resembles a perhaps\nfamiliar \u201cphenomenological reduction\u201d of all experience to\ntheir manner of appearing to the subject. But it is not \u201cthe\nsubject\u201d as such that is at issue in this Buddhist context.\nRather, the traditional Buddhist stress on momentariness is to be\nremembered: it is a reduction of all objects to subjective experience,\nbut subjective experience itself is understood as a temporal series of\nputatively discrete instantaneous mental events. So we are aiming at a\nphenomenological reduction of all moments of experience to a single\npresent moment. On the theoretical level, however, Mah\u0101y\u0101na\nphilosophy had already long exploded the viability of taking this\npre-Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist concept of momentary experience\nliterally as ultimate truth, as if these moments were actual entities\nthat were simply \u201cdifferent\u201d from one another, showing\ninstead that these moments stipulated by earlier Buddhist philosophers\nare \u201cempty\u201d of self-nature: no consistent metaphysical\nunpacking of this idea of discrete moments is possible. This\nrefutation certainly was always understood to mean that in ultimate\ntruth there could be no such entities as moments with predicates of\n\u201csame\u201d or \u201cdifferent\u201d legitimately applied to\nthem. For not being actual entities at all, and thus certainly not\ndifferent, they also could not be said to be the same, nor could any\nother predicates be validly attached to them; what does not exist\ncannot have any predicates. But where does that leave us? It might be\ntaken simply as a call to free ourselves from all conceptualization,\nall metaphysical views, and to deal instead with reality just as it is\nappears to us in our practical everyday experience. But in practical\nterms, this \u201cjust as it is appears\u201d too often reverts to\nseeing experienced time in the same old way, or even in the\npre-Buddhist way: not as instantaneous moments which are simply and\nabsolutely different from one another, to be sure, but reified as\ndiscrete clumps of experienced time which are simply and\nabsolutely different from one another, a past experience that is an\nentirely different entity from the present experience, a present that\nis different from the future. Unfortunately, this is precisely the\npresupposition that underwrites all of our delusive desires and\nattachments: the idea that past experience and the future experience\nare mutually exclusive, structured just like metaphysically\nconstituted \u201cthings\u201d in that they have consistent\nself-identities, such that one can move from suffering experience to\nnon-suffering experience in a non-ambiguous way\u2014another view\ndemolished by the very same Mah\u0101y\u0101na philosophy of\nEmptiness. This preservation of the conventional is of course\nessential to Buddhist practice, and for some Buddhist schools the\nimpossibility of giving any consistent metaphysical explanation of\nthis conventional experience of progressive time is therefore a\nfeature rather than a bug. It safeguards the necessary conventional\napprehension of progressive time and the possible achievement of truly\ncontinent and disparate states at different times that must be assumed\nfor the practice of the Buddhist path, and blocks any temptation for\nan alternative model of temporality, which on this view would be just\nbe one more metaphysical distraction and distortion of the practical\nsoteriological realities involved. The Tiantai position is also\nstrenuously committed to preserving the viability of this conventional\nmodel of progressive time for purposes of Buddhist practice, but only\nin closest tandem with the most robust possible understanding of the\ncontrary side of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na theoretical apparatus: the\nnon-difference of sams\u0101ra and nirv\u0101na, of affliction and\nwisdom, of suffering and the end of suffering. The practice focusing\non \u201call dwelling together as a single moment\u201d is designed\nto bring these two sides of Buddhist philosophy together in practice,\nas they are brought together in theory in the doctrine of the Three\nTruths. Phenomenologically as well as theoretically, this means seeing\nthat both the early Buddhist view of \u201cmomentariness\u201d (the\nidea that all experience takes place only in the instantaneous\n\u201cnow\u201d) and the alleged alternatives to this, for example\nthe perhaps more commonsensical \u201cspecious present\u201d of\nJamesian psychology (i.e., that there are no experiences that can take\nplace in an instantaneous moment, because mental reality always comes\nwith an experienced fringe of past and future, a short span of\ndiscernible and certainly finite duration to be strummed through), are\nseen equally as one-sided distortions, because both are equally true.\nBoth momentariness and duration are incoherent explanations of\nexperience, although both are unavoidable: they are locally coherent\nbut globally incoherent. The first is impossible because experience\nrequires contrast, and contrast requires a simultaneously present\nmultiplicity of moments to strum through. The latter merely pushes the\nproblem back one step, positing a new slightly larger oneness, and\nstipulating that its boundaries are vague without trying to work out\nhow a boundary that is vague can still function as a real boundary,\nthus setting up an infinite regress, abandoning the possibility of\ndetermining precisely where a single experience begins or ends but\ncontinuing to treat it practically as finite, i.e., as mutually\nexclusive with other experiences (as is the premise of all ordinary\nsense of identity and motivated action); the component parts of the\nspecious present, in spite of their constituent bleed-over into one\nanother, remain trackable as qualitatively distinct parts, and the\nspecious present as a whole continues to function as an\nunproblematically distinct though extended unit, a particular specious\npresent that is different from all the other specious presents\nexperienced by oneself and others at other times and places. The\nformer stresses the \u201cone,\u201d the latter stresses the\n\u201cmany,\u201d but in reality experience is neither one nor many,\nboth one and many; neither same nor different, both same and\ndifferent. All experience is instantaneous, and yet all\nexperience extends beyond itself into past and future\u2014and this\nnow applies as much to a specious present as to an instantaneous\npresent. Rather than seeing one of these views as true and the other\nas a pernicious distortion (for example, because the surreptitious\napplication of objective or spatial categories is distorting what is\nactually observed phenomenologically), both are admitted as precise\nand unavoidable aspects of what it is for an experience to be an\nexperience. The alternative between them is thus viewed as a case of\naspect-change, as in the Wittgensteinian duck-rabbit; we can switch\nfrom seeing the moment of experience as instantaneous or as extended\nand enduring to make sense of its manifold content, but normally\ncannot see both, or grasp the necessary connection between these\nmutually exclusive ways of apprehending it. Tiantai meditation is\naimed at experiencing both of these aspects at once, a flat picture\nthat is also three-dimensional, a flash of an instant which is also\nextended without any definite limits, for their necessary though\nparadoxical relationship reveals the true nature of all the contents\nof experience as neither-same-nor-different.\n\nThe method amounts to a deliberate experience of the\nnecessary failure of the phenomenological reduction to either\none of the two aspects, but generally focusing on the necessity and\nfailure of the aspect of momentariness: one tries to shrink the\nexperience of time down to a single point, to isolate the moment, and\nthereby discovers that even when maximally compressed in this way, the\nentire expanse of contents, of places and times outside this point,\nresurges in full irreducible splendor, but now as the\ninalienable and indivisible halo of this instant. The necessary\nfailure of the reduction is the reverse revelation of the Inherent\nEntailment of all the Three Thousand, all of which, however peripheral\nor modal, are now seen to be just as much as inalienable components of\nits present manifestation as more central and distinct ones; the same\ngoes for the unequal focus that makes some central and some\nperipheral\u2014it too is to be equally included as an inalienable\ncomponent of the manifestation just as it is. As if by squeezing a\nspring down to its minimal extent, one discovers the irrepressibility\nand immensity of its expansive power. By attempting in all good faith\nto isolate the moment as sharply as possible, one discovers that even\nwhen sliced away from all the rest of existence, all the rest of\nexistence ineluctably springs back, now as an undetachable and\nunchangeable nimbus which is experienced at once as internal and\nexternal to that moment, and in which all contents are necessarily\npresent exactly as they are, such that none can be removed or\nrepositioned, and yet all are equally extending infinitely into past\nand future in an infinity of transformations. Having enumerated all\nthat exists, all that one is not, all that is future and past, all\nthat is merely possible rather than actual, all that is imagined\nrather than real, one tries with all one\u2019s might to exclude it\nfrom the bare reality of this moment, staring fixedly only at the here\nand now. One fails: the totality of the Three Thousand floods back\nright here in and as this moment, albeit now bracingly transformed\ninto a single boundaryless cloud of surrounding contents\nsimultaneously flashing forth, in as it were a glorified form\u2014a\nsingle flash of a specifically structured instantaneous unit wherein\neach of the variegated components is neither same as nor different\nfrom each of the others, indeed where none is same as or different\nfrom the moment as a whole. By concentrating only on the rabbit in an\nattempt to make the duck completely disappear from consciousness, one\ndiscovers that the duck comes back with a vengeance, and with a new\nadamantine vividness concomitant to the power revealed by its\nunexcludability. That Mobius strip of separation as inclusion and\ninclusion as separation is the Three Truths in their constantly\navailable lived form, the phenomenological revelation of their nature\nas neither-same-nor-different going on in every moment of every\nsentient being\u2019s experience.\n\nSo to summarize: we start by mulling over all that we can think of as\npossible states of experience, enumerating all these Three Thousand\nstates of conceivable entities and all their interrelations, pausing\nto visualize whatever is possible or actual, in part and in whole,\nwhat I am and what I am not. But this mulling over requires some time\nto go through. When we have finished thinking of all we can think of,\nwe are asked to pause and consider the present moment of\nconsciousness, which is now in a position to recall all that thinking\nas having happened in the very recent past\u2014i.e., at\n\u201canother\u201d time. We try to isolate this single moment of\nlooking back at the long process of mulling, squeezing it down to a\nsingle flash to which all the previously recalled contents are\nexternal\u2014\u201cthe slightest wisp of mental activity\u201d\n(\u4ecb\u723e\u6709\u5fc3), as Zhiyi calls it in that key\npassage, arising in the instant when the organ of cognition first\ntakes notice of its object of cognition. In focusing on the\ninstantaneousness of the flash of cognition engaged in recalling the\nprocess of mulling through the list of all that could exist,\nconsidering that mulling as past, one is attempting to locate and\nfocus on a moment that excludes those moments when the mulling was\ngoing on. But in the very act of excluding them, we find all these\ncontents present to us, precisely as contents to be excluded. At once\nconsciousness is squeezed down to the tiniest possible flash and\nsimultaneously experiences the upsurge of all its excluded contents\nextending to infinity. The rabbitness of the duck and the duckness of\nthe rabbit surge forth at once. Are the previous moments spent mulling\nover all conceivable being the same as or different from the present\none looking back on them? Neither. All those other moments are present\nhere as this moment of excluding them\u2014neither same nor\ndifferent. Are the Three Thousandfold contents within this moment the\nsame as or different from each other, from the moment as a whole, or\nfrom the contents of putatively other moments also included among its\ncontents? Neither, as we\u2019ve explored at length above. But this\nis now present to us directly in the singularity of the temporal\nmoment and its indistinguishability from its multiple contents.\n\nWhen this consciousness next turns toward the external world, moving\non from recollecting the past to encountering the future, reinitiating\ncontact with unpredictable circumstances, it finds all of these new\nexperiences to be in the same relation to that single moment of\nmeditative recollection as the contents of the recollection had been.\nEvery content encountered has already been present,\n\u201cnon-differently,\u201d in that moment of recollection\ncontemplated in the meditation, though of course its new details and\nsurprising contents ensure that it is also, as expected,\n\u201cnon-same.\u201d All other experiences present themselves\nas this moment of experience, in its very isolation from\nthem. On the one hand, nothing about this moment can ever be changed;\non the other hand, none of its elements has a definite self-nature\nthat could remain the same. Endless versions of its (non-different)\nself extend into infinite (non-same) other moments. They are\ninalienable components and not merely parts of those other moments,\nand they exist nowhere other than in those non-same moments, and as\nnothing but inalienable non-repeatable components of those non-same\nmoments, neither same nor different from each new moment as a whole\nand from all its other components. All subsequent moments are in this\nway experienced as versions of this moment, endless (non-same)\ntransformations and extensions of its (non-different) self for all\neternity, but by the same token, this moment itself is experienced as\na version of all other moments, existing only as the (non-same)\ntransformation and extension of the very (non-different) self of every\nother moment past and future. As Zhiyi is quoted as saying, \u201cAs\neach mental act, itself ultimae reality, connects to each content,\nitself ultimate reality, conditional states, each being ultimate\nreality, arise one after another. Ultimate reality and ultimate\nreality pour into each other one after another: such is the effortless\nentrance into the principle of ultimate reality\u201d\n(\u5be6\u5fc3\u7e6b\u5be6\u5883\uff0c\u5be6\u7de3\u6b21\u7b2c\u751f\uff0c\u5be6\u5be6\u8fed\u76f8\u6ce8\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u5165\u5be6\u7406).\nZhanran explains, \u201cAs each mental act connects to its contents,\nthe contents also necessarily connect to the mental act.\nThis interconnection of mental act and contents is what is meant by a\nconditional state that is itself ultimate reality. Subsequent mental\nacts arise one after another, here described as \u2018pouring into\neach other\u2019: mental act pours into contents, contents pour into\ncontents, contents pour into mental act. Every mental act and every\ncontent pour into each other with each moment of experience,\ncontinuing with never a gap or pause in every instant, naturally and\neffortlessly bringing about every stage of realization.\u201d\n(\u5fc3\u82e5\u7e6b\u5883\uff0c\u5883\u5fc5\u7e6b\u5fc3\u3002\u5fc3\u5883\u76f8\u7e6b\uff0c\u540d\u70ba\u5be6\u7de3\u3002\u5fa9\u6cb9\u5f8c\u5fc3\uff0c\u5fc3\u5fc3\u76f8\u7e8c\uff0c\u540d\u8fed\u76f8\u6ce8\u3002\u5373\u662f\u5fc3\u6ce8\u65bc\u5883\uff0c\u5883\u6ce8\u65bc\u5fc3\uff0c\u5883\u6ce8\u65bc\u5883\uff0c\u5883\u6ce8\u65bc\u5fc3\uff0c\u5fc3\u5fc3\u5883\u5883\uff0c\u5ff5\u5ff5\u76f8\u6ce8\uff0c\u5982\u662f\u6b21\u7b2c\uff0c\u524e\u90a3\u7121\u9593\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u5f9e\u65bc\u89c0\u884c\u3001\u76f8\u4f3c\u4ee5\u5165\u5206\u8b49\uff0c\u6545\u4e91\u5165\u5be6\n\u3002 (\u6e5b\u7136\uff0c\u300c\u6b62\u89c0\u7fa9\u4f8b\u300d\uff0c\u5377\u4e00))\nSuch is the vista to be realized in Tiantai meditational practice, and\nthe manner in which it then extends into all the diverse experiences\none may go on to encounter as one arises from meditation and enters\nthe world\u2014the permanence-impermanence of Buddhahood-delusion\nthat arises and perishes in an instant and goes on forever.\n",
