    "main_text": "Common Modeling Frameworks || Summing up\n3.5 Summing up\n\nBesides the above frameworks, numerous additional approaches have been\nused to build simulations in social epistemology and philosophy of\nscience. Some prominent frameworks not mentioned above include the\nBayesian framework \u201cLaputa\u201d developed by Angere\n(2010\u2014in Other Internet Resources) and Olsson (2011), aimed at\nstudying social networks of information and trust, the model of\nargumentation dynamics by Betz (2013), or the influential framework by\nHong and Page (2004) utilized in the study of cognitive diversity (for\nmore on these frameworks see the entry on\n computational philosophy).\n Another evolutionary framework used in philosophy of science was\nproposed by Smaldino and McElreath (2016). The model represents a\nscientific community as a population consisting of scientific labs\nthat employ culturally transmitted methodological practices, where the\npractices undergo natural selection from one generation of scientists\nto the next, and it has been employed, for example, to study the\nselection of conservative and risk-taking science (O\u2019Connor\n2019). In the next section we take a look at some of the central\nresults obtained by ABMs in philosophy of science, based on the above\nand some other frameworks.\n",
