    "main_text": "Moral and legal group rights\n2. Moral and legal group rights\n\nGroup rights can be legal or moral or both. If a legal system accords\nrights to a group, or recognises it as an entity possessing rights, it\nwill simply be the case, for that legal system, the group has rights.\nThose legal rights might then spawn moral rights. A law may create a\nwrong that would not otherwise be a wrong but, if the legal system is\ngenerally just and if the law serves a useful purpose, its breach may\nbe considered a moral, as well as a legal, wrong. For example, you may\nhave no right to a particular good in the absence of a law giving you\nlegal title to it but, once you have legal title, my theft of that\ngood can wrong you morally as well as legally. Similarly, once a group\nhas been accorded legal rights, we might think that, in at least some\ncases, violations of its legal rights wrong it morally as well as\nlegally. A group may therefore be credited with legally-dependent\nmoral rights.\n\nIf group rights could only ever be creatures of law, however, we could\nnot protest that a legal system failed to recognise or respect a\ngroup\u2019s right. Proponents of group rights, like proponents of\nindividual rights, have been keen to use the language of rights in\narguing about the form that legal, political and social arrangements\nshould take. That implies a conception of group rights that is moral\nin foundation and that might be used to determine what legal rights\ngroups should have. It is as moral rights that group rights are most\ncontroversial. Individual rights are subject to innumerable disputes,\nbut few deny that individuals, as persons or in other capacities, are\ncapable of possessing rights. By contrast, many reject the very idea\nthat groups can possess moral rights and even those who embrace that\nidea frequently disagree over the sorts of group that can possess\nthem.\n",
