    "main_text": "Foundations of Arabic\n9. Foundations of Arabic\n\nIn several works al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b analyses features of Arabic\nas a language. Some of these works contain comparisons between Arabic\nand other languages: Greek, Syriac, Persian, and Sogdian in\n[Letters], Greek and Persian in [Commentary on De\nInterpretatione], and Greek in [Expressions].\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s comments on Greek include several\nmistranslations and dubious grammatical remarks, making it clear that\nhe didn\u2019t read Greek (for al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s\nknowledge of languages see Zimmermann 1981: xlviif). Also\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b has a strong tendency to classify languages\nas (1) Arabic and (2) \u201cother languages\u201d. So these\ncomparisons are far from being a serious contribution to comparative\nlinguistics, and one asks why he includes them. \n\nOn reading the comparisons, a pattern emerges.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b starts from a theory of the regime of\nconcepts (cf.\n Section 2\n above), and his chief concern is how well Arabic reflects this\nregime. The role of \u201cother languages\u201d is always to\nillustrate how other languages reflect the regime of concepts where\nArabic fails to do so. As Menn puts it, \u201cin practice, his\nreconstructed Greek serves as an ideal logical language, i.e.\na language in which grammatical form always tracks logical form\u201d\n(2008: 68).\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s starting point is the concepts\nrequired for sentences that appear in categorical syllogisms, such\nas\n\n\nZayd is human. Every horse is animal. Some horse is not stone.\n\n\nHere \u201cZayd\u201d , \u201chorse\u201d, \u201canimal\u201d,\n\u201cstone\u201d signify simple primary concepts; the proper name\n\u201cZayd\u201d signifies a particular (juz\u2019), and\nthe other three words signify universals (kull\u012b).\n\u201cEvery\u201d and \u201csome\u201d are quantifiers\n(s\u016br), and \u201cis\u201d is a copula\n(r\u0101bi\u1e6d) signifying the connection between two\nprimary concepts so as to form an affirmation or a denial\n([Commentary on De Interpretatione] 102.17)\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b groups all these words into two classes: noun\n(ism) for those signifying primary concepts, and particle\n(\u1e25arf) for the remainder. (Adjectives count as nouns.)\nHe makes clear that the particles are a disparate group and need\nfurther classification ([Expressions] 42.8\u201312). \n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b introduces a distinction between concepts\nthat apply to a thing permanently and those (called accident,\n\u2018ara\u1e0d) that apply only temporarily. As a result,\nconcepts have a temporal regime, and language should reflect this.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b is at his most a priori here, claiming that\nthe temporal regime of concepts should be represented by a system of\nthree tenses: past, present, and future. We don\u2019t know whether\nhe simply failed to notice other ways in which time is represented in\nArabic grammar (for example, continuous tenses and pluperfect\nconstructions), or for some reason he dismissed these features as\nmarginal. \n\nBroadly following Aristotle, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b adds to noun and\nparticle a third class, namely verb (kalima). A verb\nsimultaneously expresses three pieces of meaning: a simple primary\nconcept, a copular linking, and a tense (and hence a time). Thus in\n\u201cZayd walked\u201d, the verb \u201cwalked\u201d expresses (i)\nthe primary concept \u201cwalking\u201d, (ii) a linking of this\nconcept to the concept of Zayd, and (iii) a past tense. \n\nIn spite of his blind spot about tenses,\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s comments on verbs in Arabic contain\nsome of his best linguistic insights. For example, he notes that since\ntenses are needed only for talking about accidents, one should not\nexpect to find a verb whose primary concept is a permanent notion such\nas \u201chuman\u201d (ins\u0101n). He tests this by\nconstructing a verb from \u201chuman\u201d, namely\nta\u2019annasa. By the rules of Arabic, one would understand\nit to signify something with a temporal feature, namely\n\u201cbecoming a human\u201d ([Commentary on De\nInterpretatione] 34.4\u20139). Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b also\nuses a quite subtle linguistic argument to show that Arabic has a word\nthat can express pure tense without copula or primary concept. This is\nthe word k\u0101na, as in \u201cZayd was walking\u201d,\nzaydun k\u0101na yamsh\u012b. We can see that there is no\ncopula in k\u0101na, he tells us, because \u201cZayd is\nwalking\u201d, zaydun yamsh\u012b, already contains a copula\nin the verb yamsh\u012b ([Commentary on De\nInterpretatione] 42.6\u201318). We even find the beginnings of\nan analysis of the structure of events in\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s discussion of how the present tense\ncan signify either a point of time or an interval ([Commentary on\nDe Interpretatione] 40.3\u201341.18). \n",
