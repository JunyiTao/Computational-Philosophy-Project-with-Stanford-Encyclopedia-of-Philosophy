    "main_text": "Bayesian Networks for Legal Applications || Idioms\n3.2 Idioms\n\n\nWhile modeling the relationships between evidence and hypotheses, simple graphical patterns (called idioms) are often used. Complex graphical models can be constructed by combining these basic patterns in a modular way. General methods for constructing Bayesian networks are discussed in (Neil, Fenton, and Nielson 2000;  \nHepler, Dawid, and Leucari 2007) and general idioms are discussed in\n(Fenton, Neil, and Lagnado 2013). A few of the basic idioms are\nillustrated below.\n\nThe evidence idiom is the most basic graphical representation\nof the relation between a hypothesis and a piece of evidence:\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\nThis directed graph suggests that the direction of\ninfluence\u2014which could, but need not, be interpreted as causal\ninfluence\u2014goes from hypothesis to evidence (though the\nprobabilistic dependence goes both ways). The hypothesis node and the\nevidence node can be binary variables, such as \u201cThe defendant\nwas the source of the crime scene traces\u201d (hypothesis) and\n\u201cThe defendant genetically matches the crime traces\u201d\n(evidence). But the variables need not be binary. The hypothesis node\nmight take values from the range of 1\u201340, say the distance in\nmeters from which the gun was shot, and the evidence node might be a\ncontinuous variable representing the density of gun shot residues\n(Taroni et al. 2014).\n\nA more complex idiom, called the evidence accuracy idiom,\nconsists of two arrows going into the evidence node (Bovens and\nHartmann 2004; Fenton, Neil, and Lagnado 2013). One incoming arrow comes from the\nhypothesis node and the other from the accuracy node. This idiom can\nbe used to model, say, an alcohol test:\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\nThe directions of the arrows indicate that the accuracy of the\nevidence (accuracy node) and the alcohol level (hypothesis node)\ninfluence the outcome of the test (evidence node). The graphical model\nrepresents different sources of uncertainty. The uncertainty\nassociated with the sensitivity and specificity of the test\u2014that\nis, the probability that the tests reports excessive alcohol level\nwhen the level is excessive (sensitivity) and the probability that the\ntest reports normal alcohol level when the level is normal\n(specificity)\u2014is captured by the arrow going from the hypothesis\nnode (Excess alcohol level) to the\nevidence node (Evidence for excess).\nOther sources of uncertainty comprise the possibility that the police\nofficer lied about the test report or the possibility that the driver\ntook medications which then affected the alcohol level. These\npossibilities can be taken into consideration by adding an accuracy\nnode (or multiple accuracy nodes, if each factor is kept separate from\nthe other).\n\nWhen multiple items of evidence depend on one another\u2014as may\nhappen in many legal cases\u2014this situation is modeled by the\nevidence dependency idiom. Following an example by Fenton and\nNeil (2013 [2018]), if one of two security cameras directed at the\nsame location captured an image of someone who looks like the\ndefendant but isn\u2019t him, it is likely that the same person\nwalked by the second camera, which also captured the same image. In\nsuch cases, presenting the second recording as independent from the\nfirst would lead to overestimating the strength of the evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNode\nProposition  \n\n\nH\nDefendant present at the scene\n\n\nC1\nCamera 1 captures image of a matching\nperson \n\nC2\nCamera 2 captures image of a matching\nperson \n\nD\nWhat cameras capture is dependent\n \n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\nThe network structure is quite natural. The truth of the hypothesis,\nsay, the defendant was present at the crime scene, influences whether\nthe cameras capture an image of someone who looks like the defendant.\nHowever, if the two camera recordings are dependent on one another\n(for instance, they are directed at the same spot with a similar\nangle), the fact that the second camera captured the same image as the\nfirst does not make the hypothesis more likely once the first camera\nrecording is known.\n\nFinally, the scenario idiom can model complex hypotheses,\nconsisting of a sequence of events organized in space and time (a\nscenario). A graphical model that uses the scenario idiom would\nconsist of the following components: first, nodes for the states and\nevents in the scenario, with each node linked to the supporting\nevidence; second, a separate scenario node that has states and events\nas its children; finally, a node corresponding to the ultimate\nhypothesis as a child of the scenario node. The graphical model would\nlook like this (Vlek et al. 2014):\n\n\n\nFigure 6 [An\n extended description of figure 6\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThe scenario node unifies the different events and states. Because of\nthis unifying role, increasing the probability of one part of the\nscenario (say State/event 2) will also\nincrease the probability of the other parts (State/event\n1 and State/event\n3). This captures the fact that\nthe different components of a scenario form an interconnected sequence\nof events.\n\nA discussion of modeling crime scenarios by means of other graphical\ndevices (called structural scenario spaces) mixed with probabilities\ncan be found in the work of Shen et al. (2007); Bex (2011,\n2015); and Verheij (2017). See also the survey by Di Bello and Verheij\n(2018). Dawid and Mortera (2018) give a treatment of scenarios in\nterms of Bayesian networks. Lacave and D\u00edez (2002) show how\nBayesian Network can be used to construct explanations.\n",
