But this may be questioned\n(Alston 1986). Instead his knowledge, in particular of our actions,\nmay be thought of as Russellian acquaintance knowledge; that is, as\nconsisting of a simple cognitive relation between the knower and what\nis known (Russell 1912, Chapter 5). The idea would be that, although\nin humans acquaintance knowledge gives rise to beliefs, God has just\nthe cognitive relation to what he knows, without any consequent\nbeliefs. This seems to have been the way Boethius and Aquinas thought\nof it (Boethius, The Consolation of Philosophy, Book V, Prose\n6; Aquinas, Summa Theologica, Article 13).\n\nHow would this view about God\u2019s knowledge affect the question of\nwhether divine omniscience entails fatalism?\n\nBoth Boethius and Aquinas thought of God as outside time, but this\nview about God\u2019s knowledge could also be combined with the view\nthat he is inside time. In that case it seems that it would be be\npossible to adopt an Ockhamist account of how his knowledge in 1900\nmight be dependent on what Jones does on 1/1/2000. Certainly it looks\nas if \u201cGod was aware in 1900 of Jones\u2019s mowing the lawn on\n1/1/2000\u201d is partly about 1/1/2000. And \u201cwas aware of\u201d like\n\u201cpredated\u201d expresses a relation the first element of which does not\nnecessitate the second. We should notice, however, that the same\nawkwardness could arise in connection with God\u2019s use of\nhis knowledge as arose for the Boethian solution. If it is\nimpossible to affect the past, then God could not make use of his\nknowledge that Jones would mow the lawn on 1/1/2000 to bring something\nabout before that date, if Jones had the power to refrain from\nmowing.\n\nThere is no reason, of course, why this account of the nature of\nGod\u2019s knowledge should not be combined with the view that the\nfuture is unreal. In that case God would not come to know of\nJones\u2019s mowing of the lawn before 1/1/2000, because there would\nas yet be no fact for him to be aware of. But this would not\ncompromise his omniscience, since, presumably, on this account of\nknowledge, omniscience would be a matter of knowing all the facts.\n\nFor that matter, the account could also be combined with both the view\nthat God is outside time and the view that the future is unreal\n\u2014 as long as these two views themselves are indeed compatible.\nIn that case it would not be true before 1/1/2000 that God timelessly\nknows the Jones mows the lawn, but would be true on 1/1/2000 and\nthereafter. Of course, a timeless being cannot change, but this would\nnot involve a change in God, but merely a change in what he is related\nto. (The number 10 does not change when I refer to it.)\n",
