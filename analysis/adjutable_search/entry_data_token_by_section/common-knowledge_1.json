    "main_text": "Motivating Examples || The Centipede\n1.4 The Centipede\n\nThe mutual knowledge assumptions required to construct a backwards\ninduction solution to a game become more complex as the number of\nstages in the game increases. To see this, consider the sequential\nCentipede game depicted in the following figure:\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2\n\n\nAt each stage i\\), the agent who moves can either choose \\(R^i\\),\nwhich in the first three stages gives the other agent an opportunity\nto move, or \\(L^i\\), which ends the game.\n\nLike the Farmers\u2019 Dilemma, this game is a commitment problem for\nthe agents. If each agent could trust the other to choose \\(R^i\\) at\neach stage, then they would each expect to receive a payoff of 3.\nHowever, Alan chooses \\(L^1\\), leaving each with a payoff of only 1,\nas the result of the following backwards induction argument: \u201cIf\nnode \\(n_4\\) were to be reached, then Fiona, (being rational) would\nchoose \\(L^4\\). I, knowing this, would (being rational) choose \\(L^3\\)\nif node \\(n_3\\) were to be reached. Fiona, knowing this,\nwould (being rational) choose \\(L^2\\) if node \\(n_2\\) were to be\nreached. Hence, I (being rational) should choose \\(L^1\\).\u201d To\ncarry out this backwards induction argument, Alan implicitly assumes\nthat: (i) he knows that Fiona knows he is rational, and (ii) he knows\nthat Fiona knows that he knows she is rational. Put another way, for\nAlan to carry out the backwards induction argument, at node \\(n_1\\) he\nmust know what Fiona must know at node \\(n_2\\) to make \\(L^2\\) her\nbest response should \\(n_2\\) be reached. While in the Farmer\u2019s\nDilemma Fiona needed only first-order knowledge of\nAlan\u2019s rationality and second-order knowledge of\nAlan\u2019s knowledge of the game to derive the backwards induction\nsolution, in the Figure 1.2 game, for Alan to be able to derive the\nbackwards induction solution, the agents must have third-order\nmutual knowledge of the game and second-order mutual\nknowledge of rationality, and Alan must have\nfourth-order knowledge of this mutual knowledge of the game\nand third-order knowledge of their mutual knowledge of\nrationality. This argument also involves several counterfactuals,\nsince to construct it the agents must be able to evaluate conditionals\nof the form, \u201cIf node \\(n_i\\) were to be reached, Alan (Fiona)\nwould choose \\(L^i (R^i)\\)\u201d, which for \\(i \\gt 1\\) are\ncounterfactual, since third-order mutual knowledge of rationality\nimplies that nodes \\(n_2,\\) \\(n_3\\), and \\(n_4\\) are never\nreached.\n\nThe method of backwards induction can be applied to any sequential\ngame of perfect information, in which the agents can observe\neach others\u2019 moves in turn and can recall the entire history of\nplay. However, as the number of potential stages of play increases,\nthe backwards induction argument evidently becomes harder to\nconstruct. This raises certain questions: (1) What precisely are the\nmutual or common knowledge assumptions that are required to justify\nthe backwards induction argument for a particular sequential game? (2)\nAs a sequential game increases in complexity, would we expect the\nmutual knowledge that is required for backwards induction to start to\nfail?\n",
