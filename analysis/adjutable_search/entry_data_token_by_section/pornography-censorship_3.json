Liberal Dissent\n\nAlthough traditional defenders of a right to pornography have been\nliberals, it is important to note that not all contemporary liberals\ndefend such a right. Indeed, the question of whether there might be\ngood liberal grounds for prohibiting or otherwise regulating the\nvoluntary private consumption of (some) pornography has become the\nsubject of increasing and lively debate. Inspired by more recent\nfeminist arguments against pornography, some scholars argue that the\nliberal commitment to protecting individual autonomy, equality, freedom\nof expression and other important liberal values may in fact support a\npolicy that restricts production and consumption of certain kinds of\npornography rather than the permissive stance that liberals have\ntraditionally favored (Brison 1998, 2013; Dyzenhaus 1992; Easton 1994,\n42\u201351; Langton 1990; McGowan 2019; Okin 1987; Watson 2007, 2018;\nWest 2003). These theorists do not normally reject the harm principle,\nbroadly understood: They generally agree that the crucial question in\ndetermining whether censorship of pornography is justified is whether\nthere is reliable evidence to show that the publication or viewing of\npornography by consenting adults causes sufficiently great harm to\nsignificant interests of others. Rather, they are open to the\nlegitimacy of censorship because they think that the production and\nconsumption of certain sorts of sexually explicit material\u2014in\nparticular, violent pornography and non-violent but degrading\npornography\u2014may in fact cause sufficiently significant harm to\nothers, particularly women.\n\nThese theorists often follow social science researchers in drawing\nmore fine-grained distinctions within the general category of\npornography (i.e., the sexually explicit material whose primary\nfunction is to produce sexual arousal in those who view or read them).\nThey often distinguish between 1) violent pornography, 2) non-violent\nbut degrading pornography, and 3) non-violent and non-degrading\npornography, since there is some evidence to suggest that some of these\nmaterials (e.g., in categories 1 and 2) may be harmful in ways that\nother material (e.g., category 3) is not.\n\nOne important dimension of the disagreement between those liberals\nwho defend a right to pornography and those who think that liberals\nshould be open to the legitimacy of censorship is empirical:\nThey disagree about the crucial empirical issue of whether there is\nreliable evidence to show that the production and consumption of\npornography by consenting adults in fact causes harm to others,\nparticularly women. But frequently they also disagree about some\nimportant conceptual matters as well. In particular, they may\ndisagree (albeit sometimes implicitly) about how three central elements\nof the harm principle should be understood: (i) exactly what counts as\n\u201charm\u201d to others in the relevant sense; (ii) when can we\nsay that something is a \u201ccause,\u201d or a sufficiently\n\u201cdirect cause,\u201d of a harm; and (iii) how much harm to\nothers is \u201csufficiently great\u201d to justify coercive\nsanctions against the speech or conduct that produces it. In other\nwords, they disagree about how the harm principle should be interpreted\nand applied.\n\nMany argue that more traditional liberal conceptions of the\ninterests or rights that individuals have, and so of what activities\ncan cause harm to them, is too narrow. It ignores the way in which\nthreats to individuals\u2019 interests can come not just from the state, but\nalso from other social practices and circumstances (e.g., substantive\nsocio-economic disadvantage) that can prevent the meaningful exercise\nof freedom just as effectively. The state may thus have a legitimate\nrole to play in promoting the social conditions that enable individuals\nto exercise their rights in meaningful ways and in regulating such\nactivities of non-governmental agents or groups as may serve\nsignificantly to infringe them.\n",
