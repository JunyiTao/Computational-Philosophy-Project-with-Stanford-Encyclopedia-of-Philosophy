    "preamble": "\n\nSecond-order logic has a subtle role in the philosophy of mathematics.\nIt is stronger than first order logic in that it incorporates\n\u201cfor all properties\u201d into the syntax, while first order\nlogic can only say \u201cfor all elements\u201d. At the same time it\nis arguably weaker than set theory in that its quantifiers range over\none limited domain at a time, while set theory has the universalist\napproach in that its quantifiers range over all possible domains. This\nstronger-than-first-order-logic/weaker-than-set-theory duality is the\nsource of lively debate, not least because set theory is usually\nconstrued as based on first order logic. How can second-order logic be\nat the same time stronger and weaker? To make the situation even more\ncomplex, it was suggested early on that in order that the strength of\nsecond-order logic can be exploited to its full extent and in order\nthat \u201cfor all properties\u201d can be given an exact\ninterpretation, a first order set-theoretical background has to be\nassumed. This seemed to undermine the claimed strength of second-order\nlogic as well as its role as the primary foundation of mathematics. It\nalso seemed to attach second-order logic to aspects of set theory\nwhich second-order logic might have wanted to bypass: the higher\ninfinite, the independence results, and the difficulties in finding\nnew convincing axioms. Setting aside philosophical questions, it is\nundeniable and manifested by a continued stream of interesting\nresults, that second-order logic is part and parcel of a\nlogician\u2019s toolbox.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nSecond-order\n logic[1]\n was introduced by Frege in his Begriffsschrift (1879) who also coined\nthe term \u201csecond order\u201d (\u201czweiter\nOrdnung\u201d) in (1884: \u00a753). It was widely used in logic\nuntil the 1930s, when set theory started to take over as a foundation\nof mathematics. It is difficult to say exactly why this happened, but\nset theory has certain simplicity in being based on one single binary\npredicate \\(x\\in y\\), compared to second- and higher-order logics,\nincluding type theory. Discussion among philosophers of the merits of\nsecond-order logic especially in comparison to set theory continues to\nthis day (Shapiro 1991). Meanwhile second-order logic has become a\nstandard tool of computer science logic, finite model theory in\nparticular. Central questions of theoretical computer science, such as\nthe P = NP? question, can be seen as questions about second-order\nlogic in the finite context.\n\nUltimately second-order logic is just another formal language. It can\nbe given the standard treatment making syntax, semantics and proof\ntheory exact by working in a mathematical metatheory which we choose\nto be set theory. It would be possible to use second-order logic\nitself as metatheory, but it would be more complicated, simply because\nsecond-order logic is less developed than set theory.\n\nThe distinction between first order logic and second-order logic is\neasiest to understand in elementary mathematics. Let us consider\nnumber theory. The objects of our study are the natural numbers 0, 1,\n2,\u2026 and their arithmetic. With first order logic we can\nformulate statements about number theory by using atomic expressions\n\\(x = y,\\) \\(x+y = z\\) and \\(x\\times y = z\\) combined with the\npropositional operations \\(\\land,\\) \\(\\neg,\\) \\(\\lor,\\) \\(\\to\\) and\nthe quantifiers \\(\\forall x\\) and \\(\\exists x\\). Here the variables\nx, y, z,\u2026 are thought to range over the\nnatural numbers. With second-order logic we can express more: we have\nvariables x, y, z,\u2026 as in first order\nlogic for numbers. In addition we have variables X, Y,\nZ,\u2026 for properties of numbers and relations between\nnumbers as well as quantifiers \\(\\forall X\\) and \\(\\exists X\\) for\nthese variables. We have the atomic expressions of first order logic\nand also new atomic expressions of the form \\(X(y_1,\\ldots,\ny_n)\\).\n\nAn interesting and much studied question arises: what properties of\nnatural numbers can be expressed in first order logic and what can be\nexpressed in second-order logic? The question is equally interesting\nif \u201cexpressed\u201d is replaced by \u201cproved\u201d, once a\nsuitable proof system is given in both cases. We can replace natural\nnumbers by some other mathematical context, for example real numbers,\ncomplex numbers, and so on.\n\nWith just the constant \\(0\\) and the unary function \\(n \\mapsto n^+\\)\n(where \\(n^+\\) means \\(n+1\\)) we can express in second-order logic the\nInduction Axiom  \n\n\\[\\tag{1}\\label{ind} \\forall X\\left(\\left[X(0) \\land \\forall\ny\\left(X(y) \\to X(y^+)\\right)\\right] \\to \\forall y\\,X(y)\\right), \\]\n\n\nof natural numbers. This, together with the axioms \\(\\forall\nx\\,\\neg(x^+=0)\\) and \\(\\forall x\\,\\forall y(x^+=y^+\\to x=y)\\)\ncharacterizes the natural numbers with their successor operation up to\nisomorphism. In first order logic any theory which has a countably\ninfinite model has also an uncountable model (by the Upward\nL\u00f6wenheim Skolem Theorem). Hence (\\ref{ind}) cannot be expressed\nin first order logic. Another typical second-order expression is the\nCompleteness Axiom of the linear order \\(\\le\\) of the real\nnumbers:  \n\n\\[\\tag{2}\\label{comp} \\forall X\\left(\\left[\\exists y\\,X(y) \\land\n\\exists z\\,\\forall y(X(y) \\to y \\le z)\\right] \\to\\\\ \\exists z\\,\\forall\ny\\left(\\exists u\\left(X(u) \\land y \\le u\\right) \\lor z \\le\ny\\right)\\right), \\]\n\n\nThis, together with the axioms of ordered fields characterizes the\nordered field of real numbers up to isomorphism. In first order logic\nany countable theory which has an infinite model has also a countable\nmodel (by the Downward L\u00f6wenheim Skolem Theorem). Hence\n(\\ref{comp}) cannot be expressed in first order logic.\n\nTo early logicians it seemed natural to use second-order logic on a\npar with first order logic, as if there were not much difference. This\nincluded Russell, L\u00f6wenheim, Hilbert, and Zermelo. Essentially\nonly Skolem emphasized the difference (see Moore 1988 for the\nemergence of first order logic). In 1929 G\u00f6del proved his\nCompleteness Theorem and the next year his Incompleteness Theorem. It\nbecame gradually obvious that second-order logic is very different\nfrom first order logic. One of the first indicators was the\nincompleteness phenomenon. G\u00f6del showed that any effective\naxiomatization of number theory is incomplete. On the other hand,\nthere was a simple finite categorical\u2014hence complete\n (\u00a710)\u2014axiomatization\n of the structure \\((\\oN,\\) \\(+,\\) \\(\\times)\\) in second-order logic\n(see also the discussion related to (\\ref{ind})). This showed that\nthere cannot be such a complete axiomatization of second-order logic\nas there was for first order logic. What became known in the case of\nfirst order logic as G\u00f6del\u2019s Completeness Theorem simply\ncannot hold for second-order logic.\n\nThe situation changed somewhat when Henkin proved the Completeness\nTheorem for second-order logic with respect to so-called general\nmodels\n (\u00a79).\n Now it became possible to use second-order logic in the same way as\nfirst order logic, if only one keeps in mind that the semantics is\nbased on general models. The ability of second-order logic to\ncharacterize mathematical structures up to isomorphism does not extend\nto general models (except in the form of internal\ncategoricity\u2014see\n \u00a710).\n Any second-order theory with an infinite general model has general\nmodels of all infinite cardinalities, and therefore cannot be\ncategorical in the context of general models. We shall discuss general\nmodels and the related Henkin models in\n \u00a79.\n2. The Syntax of Second-Order Logic\n\nA vocabulary in second-order logic is just as a vocabulary in\nfirst order logic, that is, a set L of relation,\nfunction and constant symbols. Each relation and\nfunction symbol has an arity, which is a positive natural\nnumber.\n\nSecond-order logic has several kinds of variables. It has\nindividual variables denoted by lower case letters\n\\(x, y, z, \\ldots\\) possibly with subscripts. It has property\nand relation variables denoted by upper case letters\n\\(X,Y,Z,\\ldots\\) possibly with subscripts. Finally, it has\nfunction variables denoted by upper case letters \\(F, G, H,\n\\ldots\\) possibly with subscripts. Sometimes function variables are\nomitted as, after all, functions are special kinds of relations. Each\nrelation and function variable has an arity, which is a positive\nnatural number.\n\nIt is noteworthy that although we have property variables we do not\nhave variables for properties of properties. Such variables would be\npart of the formalism of third order logic, see\n \u00a712.\n\nThe terms of second-order logic are defined recursively as\nfollows: Constant symbols and individual variables are terms. If\n\\(t_1,\\ldots,t_n\\) are terms, U is an n-ary function\nsymbol and F is an n-ary function variable, then\n\\(U(t_1,\\ldots,t_n)\\) and \\(F(t_1,\\ldots,t_n)\\) are terms. Note that\nterms denote individuals, not relations or properties. Thus X\nalone is not a term but x is.\n\nThe atomic formulas of second-order logic are defined from\nterms as follows: If t and \\(t'\\) are terms, then \\(t = t'\\) is\nan atomic formula. If R is an n-ary relation symbol and\n\\(t_1,\\ldots,t_n\\) are terms, then \\(R(t_1,\\ldots,t_n)\\) is an atomic\nformula. If X is an n-ary relation variable, then also\n\\(X(t_1,\\ldots,t_n)\\) is an atomic formula. The intuitive meaning of\n\\(X(t_1,\\ldots,t_n)\\) is that the elements \\(t_1,\\ldots, t_n\\) are in\nthe relation X or are predicated by X. We do\nnot allow atomic formulas of the form \\(X = Y\\), although they would\nhave an obvious meaning. We achieve the same effect by using\nquantifiers.\n\n\nDefinition 1 The formulas of second-order\nlogic are defined as follows: Atomic formulas are formulas. If\n\\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are formulas, then \\(\\neg\\phi\\), \\(\\phi\\land\n\\psi\\), \\(\\phi\\lor \\psi\\), \\(\\phi \\to \\psi\\) and \\(\\phi\n\\leftrightarrow \\psi\\) are formulas. If \\(\\phi\\) is a formula,\nx an individual variable, X a relation variable and\nF a function variable, then \\(\\exists x\\phi\\), \\(\\forall\nx\\phi\\), \\(\\exists X\\phi\\), \\(\\forall X\\phi, \\exists F\\phi\\) and\n\\(\\forall F\\phi\\) are formulas.\n\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that in second order logic we can actually define the identity \\(t=t'\\) as \\(\\forall X(X(t)\\leftrightarrow X(t'))\\) and prove the familiar axioms of identity from properties of the implication.\n\n\n\nAn important special case is monadic second-order logic where\nno function variables are allowed and the relation variables are\nrequired to be monadic (a.k.a. unary), i.e., of arity one.\n\nWe did not take \\(X=Y\\) as an atomic formula (although we could have)\nbut having introduced the quantifiers we can use  \n\n\\[\\tag{3}\\label{XY} \\forall x_1\\ldots \\forall\nx_n(X(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\leftrightarrow Y(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)) \\]\n\n\nas a substitute for \\(X=Y\\). The advantage of taking \\(X=Y\\) as a\nbasic atomic formula would be that using (\\ref{XY}) brings along extra\nquantifiers. Sometimes it is interesting to minimize the number of\nquantifiers in a formula. Also, (\\ref{XY}) gives the identity \\(X=Y\\) an extensional flavour in contrast to a possibly different intensional construal. \n\nThe concepts of a free and bound occurrence\nof a variable in a formula are defined in the usual way. A formula is\ncalled a sentence if it has no free variables. The concept of\na term being free for a variable in a formula is\ndefined as in first order logic.\n\n3. The Semantics of Second-Order Logic\n\nIn order to define the semantics of second-order logic we have to\nagree what our metalanguage is. This fact has nothing to do\nwith second-order logic but is rather a general feature of semantics\n(Tarski 1933 [1956]). The most commonly used metalanguage for\nsecond-order logic is set theory. We thus give a\nset-theoretical interpretation of second-order logic, interpreting\n\u201cproperties\u201d as sets. This is the most common choice and\nbrings out the main features of second-order logic. We cannot\ninterpret all properties by sets, e.g. the property of being\nidentical to oneself. But if the domain that the individual variables\nrange over is taken to be a set, then we can meaningfully interpret\nproperties of individuals in that domain as sets. If we want to\ninterpret second-order logic in a domain which is too large to be a\nset, we can use the set-theoretical concept of a class (see entry on\n set theory\n for more on classes). \n\nWe use the same concept of an L-structure (or equivalently, an\nL-model) as in first order logic. That is, an\nL-structure \\(\\mm\\) has a domain M,\nwhich is any non-empty set, an interpretation \\(c^\\mm \\in M\\)\nof any constant symbol c of L, an interpretation \\(R^\\mm\n\\subseteq M^n\\) of any n-ary relation symbol R of\nL, as well as an interpretation \\(H^\\mm : M^n \\to M\\) of any\nn-ary function symbol H of L.\nConvention: Whenever we use upper case Fraktur letters,\nsuch as \\(\\mm,\\mn\\) etc, to name a structure, we use the upper case\nItalic versions of those letters, such as \\(M,N\\) etc, to name the\ndomain of the structure.\n\nGiven an L-structure \\(\\mm\\), an assignment is a\nfunction s from variables to the domain M of \\(\\mm\\)\nsuch that: if x is an individual variable, then \\(s(x) \\in M\\);\nif X is relation variable of arity n, then \\(s(X)\n\\subseteq M^n\\); if F is function variable of arity n,\nthen \\(s(F) : M^n \\to M\\). We use \\(s(P/X)\\) to denote the assignment\nwhich is otherwise as s except that the value at X has\nbeen changed to P. Similarly \\(s(a/x)\\) and \\(s(f/F)\\).\n Note that \\(0\\)-ary relation variables are essentially propositions. Their interpretations under an assignment are the truth values (true, false). \\(0\\)-ary function variables are essentially individual variables as an assignment maps a \\(0\\)-ary function symbol simply to an element of \\(M\\).\n\nThe value \\(t^\\mm\\langle s\\rangle\\) of a term t in a model\n\\(\\mm\\) under the interpretation s is defined as in first order\nlogic.\n\nThe concept \\(\\mm\\models\\phi\\) of the truth of the sentence\n\\(\\phi\\) in \\(\\mm\\) can now be defined by first defining the auxiliary\nconcept \\(\\mm\\models_s\\phi\\) of the assignment \\(s\\) satisfying\n\\(\\phi\\) in \\(\\mm\\) (see entry on\n Tarski's truth definitions\n for more details): \n\n\nDefinition 2 (Tarski\u2019s Truth Definition) The\ntruth definition for second-order logic extends the respective truth\ndefinition for first order logic by the clauses:\n\n\\(\\mm \\models_s X(t_1,\\ldots,t_n)\\) iff \\((t^\\mm_1 \\langle\ns\\rangle,\\ldots,t^\\mm_n \\langle s\\rangle) \\in s(X)\\).\n\\(\\mm\\models_s \\exists X\\,\\phi\\) iff \\(\\mm\\models_{s(P/X)} \\phi\\)\nfor some \\(P \\subseteq M^n\\).\n\\(\\mm\\models_s \\exists F\\,\\phi\\) iff \\(\\mm\\models_{s(f/F)} \\phi\\)\nfor some \\(f:M^n \\to M.\\)\n\n\nand similarly for the universal quantifiers. For a sentence \\(\\phi\\)\nwe define \\(\\mm\\models\\phi\\) to mean \\(\\mm\\models_s\\phi\\) for all\n(equivalently some) s, and then say \\(\\phi\\) is true\nin \\(\\mm\\).\n\n\nIn clause 1 of the above definition we follow the common practice of\ngiving a set-theoretical interpretation to the predication\n\\(X(t_1,\\ldots,t_n)\\). Having interpreted X as a subset of\n\\(M^n\\), we interpret predication \\(X(t_1,\\ldots,t_n)\\) as membership\n\\((t^\\mm_1 \\langle s\\rangle,\\ldots,t^\\mm_n \\langle s\\rangle) \\in\ns(X)\\). In clause 2 we interpret quantification over properties and\nrelations as quantification over subsets of the cartesian product\n\\(M^n\\). Respectively, in clause 3 we interpret quantification over\nfunctions as quantification over sets that are functions \\(M^n\\to M\\)\nin the set-theoretical sense.\n\nNow that the semantics of second-order logic is defined we can define\nwhat it means for a formula \\(\\phi\\) to be valid and for two\nformulas \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) to be logically equivalent. As\nin logic in general, we say that \\(\\phi\\) is (logically) valid if\n\\(\\mm\\models_s\\phi\\) holds for all \\(\\mm\\) and all s. Likewise,\nwe define \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) to be logically equivalent,\n\\(\\phi\\equiv\\psi\\), if \\(\\phi\\leftrightarrow\\psi\\) is valid. Two\nmodels \\(\\mm\\) and \\(\\mn\\) are said to be second-order\nequivalent, in symbols \\(\\mm\\equiv_{L^2}\\mn\\) if for all\nsentences \\(\\phi\\) we have \\(\\mm\\models\\phi\\iff\\mn\\models\\psi\\).\n\nThe truth definition involves the concepts \u201cfor some \\(P\n\\subseteq M^n\\)\u201d and \u201cfor some \\(f:M^n \\to M\\)\u201d.\nSince we assume set theory as our metalanguage, we can interpret these\nin the sense of set theory. Thus we interpret \u201cfor some \\(P\n\\subseteq M^n\\)\u201d as \u201cfor some set \\(P \\subseteq\nM^n\\)\u201d and \u201cfor some \\(f:M^n\\to M\\)\u201d as \u201cfor\nsome set which is a function \\(f:M^n\\to M\\)\u201d.\n\nFor infinite M the collection of subsets of \\(M^n\\) and the set\nof functions \\(M^n\\to M\\) are famously complex. Currently set theory\n(ZFC) cannot even decide how many subsets of an infinite set\nthere are. The situation is quite different with first order logic.\nThe respective concept \u201cfor some \\(a \\in M\\)\u201d is\nunproblematic, relatively speaking. Of course, depending on what\nM is, \u201cfor some \\(a \\in M\\)\u201d can be quite\nproblematic too. To reflect the difficulties involved with finding a\n\\(P \\subseteq M^n\\) or an \\(f:M^n \\to M\\) we sometimes say we\n\u201cguess\u201d a \\(P \\subseteq M^n\\) or an \\(f:M^n \\to M\\).\n\nWhen we use set theory as the metatheory for the semantics of\nfirst order logic, the reliance on the metatheory is of a\nlower degree than when we use set theory as the metatheory for the\nsemantics of second order logic. The central concept, which\nexplains the difference, is that of absoluteness. For\ndetails, see\n \u00a76.\n\n3.1 The Ehrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9 game of second-order logic\n\nThe Ehrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9 game is a game-theoretic\ntool for investigating to what extent two models are similar (see\nentry on\n logic and games\n for a general introduction to Ehrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9 games).\nTwo isomorphic models would be very similar but normally we are\ninterested in similarity of models that are not isomorphic. The\nEhrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9 game of second-order logic\ncharacterizes \\(\\ma\\equiv_{L^2}\\mn\\), i.e. the proposition that\nexactly the same second-order sentences are true in \\(\\ma\\) and\n\\(\\mb\\), just as the Ehrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9 game of first\norder logic characterizes the first order elementary equivalence\n\\(\\ma\\equiv\\mn\\). See the entry on\n first-order model theory\n for more on elementary equivalence.\n\nFor simplicity we disallow function and constant symbols as well as\nfunction variables in this section. Suppose \\(\\ma\\) and \\(\\mb\\) are\ntwo models of the same finite relational vocabulary. In the game which\nwe denote by \\(G^2_n(\\ma,\\mb)\\) two players I and II pick one at a\ntime subsets (or elements) of A or subsets (or elements) of\nB. During round i of the game player I can pick a\nrelation \\(A_i\\) on A (or an element \\(a_i\\) of A) and\nthen player II has to pick a relation \\(B_i\\) on B of the same\narity as \\(A_i\\) (or an element \\(b_i\\) of on B) and vice\nversa: Player I can instead pick a relation \\(B_i\\) on B (or an\nelement \\(b_i\\) of B) and then II picks a relation \\(A_i\\) on\nA of the same arity as \\(B_i\\) (or an element \\(a_i\\)) of\nA. After n rounds the pairs of played elements\n\\((a_i,b_i)\\) form a binary relation R on \\(A\\times B\\). If\nthis relation is a partial isomorphism of the structures \\(\\ma\\) and\n\\(\\mb\\) expanded by the played relations \\(A_i\\) and \\(B_i\\), i.e., it\npreserves atomic formulas and their negations, we say that II has won.\nThe models \\(\\ma\\) and \\(\\mb\\) satisfy the same second-order sentences\nif and only if for each \\(n\\in \\oN\\) Player II has a winning strategy\nin \\(G^2_n(\\ma,\\mb)\\). A model class (i.e. a class of models of a\nfixed vocabulary, closed under isomorphisms) K is definable in\nsecond-order logic if and only if there is an n such that if\n\\(\\ma\\in K\\) and Player II has a winning strategy in the\n\\(G^2_n(\\ma,\\mb)\\), then \\(\\mb\\in K\\).\n\nThe first order version \\(G^1_n(\\ma,\\mb)\\), where players play only\nindividual elements, i.e., no relations are played, is very useful in\nworking with first order logic. Unfortunately the game\n\\(G^2_n(\\ma,\\mb)\\) is much more complex. It is very difficult to\ninvent winning strategies for Player II except in the trivial case\nwhen \\(\\ma\\cong\\mb\\). If Player I plays a binary relation R on\nA, Player II should be able to play a binary relation \\(R'\\) on\nB such that whatever challenges Player I makes in the rest of\nthe game, even involving new binary relations, the relations R\nand \\(R'\\) look similar. If \\(V=L\\), then countable second-order\nequivalent models (with a finite vocabulary) are actually isomorphic\n(Ajtai 1979). For details, see\n \u00a710.\n Thus consistently in countable models there is no other winning\nstrategy for Player II than an isomorphism. Perhaps this explains why\nthe game is not as useful in second-order logic as it is in first\norder logic. However, if we restrict to monadic second-order logic,\nwhich in terms of the Ehrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9 game means\nrestricting the game to unary predicates, the situation\nchanges. A unary predicate just divides the model into two parts. If\nPlayer I divides A into two parts, Player II should find a\nsimilar division in B. This is more reasonable and there\nactually are useful strategies for Player II. For examples in the\nfinite context see\n \u00a716.\n\n\n\n4. Properties of Second-Order Formulas\n\nMany syntactic operations that we are used to in first order logic\nwork equally well in second-order logic. One such is the operation of\nrelativization, in which we want to limit what a formula\nexpresses to a fixed part of the universe. For example, we may\nconsider models where a certain unary predicate U is used for\nthe set of natural numbers. Then we relativize our axioms of\narithmetic to the predicate U. Some other part of the model may\nbe used for the power set of the set of natural numbers. Then we\nrelativize our axioms of power set (see\n \u00a75.3)\n to that part, and so on.\n\nIf \\(\\mm\\) is a structure and \\(A\\subseteq M\\), then \\(\\mm^{A}\\) is\nobtained by restricting the relations \\(R^\\mm\\) and functions\n\\(F^\\mm\\) to A. This does not always result in a structure but\nif it does, it is called the relativization of \\(\\mm\\) to\nA. Suppose\n\\(\\phi=\\phi(x_1,\\ldots,x_n,X_1,\\ldots,X_m,F_1,\\ldots,F_k)\\) is a\nsecond-order formula and U is a unary relation variable. There\nis a second-order formula \\(\\phi^{U}\\), the relativization of \\(\\phi\\)\nto U, such that for all \\(\\mm\\) for which \\(\\mm^{U^\\mm}\\) is a\nstructure:  \n\n\\[\\mm\\models\\phi^{U}\\iff \\mm^{U^\\mm}\\models\\phi.\n\\]\n\n\nIntuitively, \\(\\phi^{U}\\) says about \\(U^\\mm\\) what \\(\\phi\\) says\nabout M. To obtain \\(\\phi^{U}\\) from \\(\\phi\\) one restricts all\nthe first order quantifiers to elements of U and second-order\nquantifiers to subsets, relations and functions on U.\n\nHierarchies based on quantifier structure are a useful method to\ncompare the definability of concepts in different systems. In first\norder logic it was observed very early on that formulas can be brought\ninto a logically equivalent Prenex Normal Form in which all\nquantifiers occur in the beginning of the formula. This is possible\nalso in second-order logic and the proof is essentially the same.\nMoreover, using the equivalence (which is reminiscent of a principle\nof set theory called Axiom of Choice, to which we return in Section\n5.4., since in the below formula the relation \\(Y\\) in a sense chooses\none \\(X\\) for each \\(x\\) and puts them together into one relation\n\\(Y\\) \u2013 see entry on\n Axiom of Choice\n for more on the topic.) \n\n\\[\\forall x\\,\\exists X\\,\\phi\\equiv \\exists Y\\,\\forall x\\,\\phi',\n\\]\n\n\nwhere the arity of Y is one higher than the arity of X,\nand \\(\\phi'\\) is obtained from \\(\\phi\\) by replacing everywhere\n\\(X(t_1,\\ldots,t_n)\\) by \\(Y(x,t_1,\\ldots,t_n)\\), one can bring every\nsecond-order logic formula to a logically equivalent normal form \n\n\\[\\tag{4}\\label{qqq}\nQ_1X_1\\ldots Q_nX_n\\phi,\n\\]\n\n\nwhere each \\(Q_i\\) is either \\(\\exists\\) or \\(\\forall\\) and \\(\\phi\\)\nis first order.\n\n\n\n\nNotation\nThe \\(Q_i\\) in (\\ref{qqq}) are: \n\n\\(\\Sigma^1_1\\)\nAll existential \n\n\\(\\Pi^1_1\\)\nAll universal \n\n\\(\\Sigma^1_2\\)\nFirst existential, then universal \n\n\\(\\Pi^1_2\\)\nFirst universal, then existential \n\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\) \n\n\n\nNotation\nThe formula is logically equivalent to: \n\n\\(\\Delta^1_1\\)\nBoth \\(\\Sigma^1_1\\) and \\(\\Pi^1_1\\) formulas \n\n\\(\\Delta^1_2\\)\nBoth \\(\\Sigma^1_2\\) and \\(\\Pi^1_2\\) formulas \n\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\) \n\n\nTable 1: The hierarchy of second-order\nformulas.\n\n\n\nBy restricting what kind of quantifiers the sequence \\(Q_1X_1\\ldots\nQ_nX_n\\) of the Prenex Normal Form (\\ref{qqq}) can contain we obtain\nthe classes of \\(\\Sigma^1_n\\)-, \\(\\Pi^1_n\\)- and\n\\(\\Delta^1_n\\)-formulas, as indicated in\n Table 1.\n For example, the second-order formulas (1) and (2) are\n\\(\\Pi^1_1\\)-formulas.\n\nWe have considered above only quantifiers that bind relation variables\nbut the situation is exactly the same if we had bound function\nvariables.\n\nThese classes of formulas have some obvious closure properties: They\nare all closed, up to logical equivalence, under \\(\\land , \\lor\\), and\nfirst order quantifiers. Moreover, the hierarchy is proper in the\nsense that for all \\(n\\ge 1\\)  \n\n\\[\\tag{5}\\label{kurat}\n\\Sigma^1_n \\nsubseteq \\Pi^1_n\\text{ and } \\Pi^1_n  \\nsubseteq \\Sigma^1_n,\n\\]\n\n\nwhich can be proved with a diagonalisation argument. The classes\n\\(\\Delta^1_n\\) are closed under \\(\\land , \\lor, \\neg\\) and first order\nquantifiers. By Craig\u2019s Interpolation Theorem,\n\\(\\Delta^1_1\\)-formulas are logically equivalent to first order\nformulas\n [2].\n\nThere is a sense in which \\(\\Pi^1_1\\), or equivalently \\(\\Sigma^1_1\\),\nalready has the full power of second-order logic, although the above\nhierarchy result (\\ref{kurat}) shows that this cannot literally be\ntrue. To see this, i.e., to see what the reduction of second-order\nlogic to its \\(\\Pi^1_1\\)-part means, let L be a vocabulary,\nE a binary and U a unary relation symbol, both not in\nL. Let \\(\\theta\\) be the second-order \\(\\Pi^1_1\\)-formula\n \n\n\\[\\tag{6}\\label{ex6}\n\\forall X(\\phi_1\\land\\phi_2\\land\\phi_3),\n\\]\n\n\nwhere  \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\phi_1&\\text{ is }\\quad \\forall x\\,\\forall y(\\forall z(E(z,x)\\leftrightarrow E(z,y))\\to x=y)\\\\\n\\phi_2&\\text{ is }\\quad \\forall x\\,\\forall y(E(x,y)\\to (U(x)\\land\\neg U(y)))\\\\\n\\phi_3&\\text{ is }\\quad \\forall x (X(x)\\to U(x))\\to\\exists y\\,\\forall z(X(z)\\leftrightarrow E(z,y)).\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nIt is easy to\n see[3]\n that models of \\(\\theta\\) are, up to isomorphism, models \\(\\mm\\)\nwhere \\(M=U^\\mm\\cup\\P(U^\\mm)\\), \\(U^\\mm\\cap\\P(U^\\mm)=\\emptyset\\) and\nfor all \\(a,b\\in M\\), \\(E^\\mm(a,b)\\leftrightarrow a\\in b\\). In such a\nmodel monadic second-order formulas \\(\\phi\\) over \\(U^\\mm\\) can be\nreduced to first order formulas \\(\\phi^*\\) over M. This\nreduction, due to Hintikka (1955) and further developed by Montague\n(1963), shows that \\(\\Pi^1_1\\)-formulas alone are enough to express\nany second-order property with extra predicates. The idea can be\nextended to third and higher order logic.\n\nAs a consequence, checking the validity of a second-order sentence\n\\(\\phi\\) can be recursively reduced to checking the validity of the\n\\(\\Sigma^1_1\\)-sentence \\(\\theta\\to\\phi^*\\). Likewise checking whether\na second-order sentence \\(\\phi\\) has a model of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\)\ncan be reduced to asking whether the \\(\\Pi^1_1\\)-sentence\n\\(\\theta\\land\\phi^*\\) has a model of cardinality \\(2^\\kappa\\). This\nmeans that the L\u00f6wenheim\n number[4]\n and the Hanf\n number[5]\n of the entire second-order logic are the same as those of the\nfragment \\(\\Pi^1_1\\).\n\nSumming up, upon first inspection the levels \\(\\Sigma^1_n\\) and\n\\(\\Pi^1_n\\) of the hierarchy of second-order formulas grow strictly in\nexpressive power as n increases, but a more careful analysis\nreveals that already the first level \\(\\Sigma^1_1\\cup \\Pi^1_1\\) has\nthe power of all the levels \\(\\Sigma^1_n, \\Pi^1_n\\) even if the power\nis somewhat implicit and needs to be brought to light.\n\nIn set theory there is the Levy-hierarchy of \\(\\Sigma_n\\)-\nand \\(\\Pi_n\\)-formulas (L\u00e9vy 1965). Formulas where all\nquantifiers are bounded, i.e., of the form \\(\\forall x\\in y\\) or of\nthe form \\(\\exists x\\in y\\) for some x and y, are called\n\\(\\Sigma_0\\) or equivalently \\(\\Pi_0\\). Formulas of the form \\(\\forall\nx\\,\\phi\\), where \\(\\phi\\) is \\(\\Sigma_n\\), are called \\(\\Pi_{n+1}\\).\nFormulas of the form \\(\\exists x\\,\\phi\\), where \\(\\phi\\) is \\(\\Pi_n\\),\nare called \\(\\Sigma_{n+1}\\). This is a strict hierarchy roughly for\nthe same reason why the hierarchy of second-order \\(\\Sigma^1_n\\)- and\n\\(\\Pi^1_n\\)-formulas is strict. But there is no known method to reduce\nthe truth of an arbitrary formula to the truth of a formula on the\n\\(\\Sigma_1\\cup\\Pi_1\\) level. In fact, if the decision problem,\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem number and Hanf number are suitably defined for\n\\(\\Sigma_n\\cup \\Pi_n\\)-formulas of set theory, the decision problem\ngets more and more complicated, and the numbers obtained get bigger\nand bigger as n increases (see\n Theorem 4;\n V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 1979).\n\nThe hierarchy \\(\\Sigma_n^1\\cup \\Pi_n^1\\) inside second-order logic and\nthe hierarchy \\(\\Sigma_n\\cup\\Pi_n\\) in set theory, are compared to\neach other in\n \u00a77.\n\n5. The Infamous Power of Second-Order Logic\n\n5.1 Putting distance between second- and first-order logic\n\nSecond-order logic has some remarkable qualities which we will now\nuncover in detail. Above we characterized the structure of the natural\nnumbers by means of (\\ref{ind}). This application of second-order\nlogic is perhaps the most famous and most important. We now\nreformulate this in a slightly more general form in order to get more\npower out of it. Suppose U is a unary relation variable\n(\u201cthe set of natural numbers\u201d), G a unary function\nvariable (\u201cthe successor function\u201d), and z an\nindividual variable (\u201cthe zero\u201d). Let\n\\(\\theta_{\\textrm{PA}}(U,G,z)\\) be the sentence  \n\n  \\[\\tag{7}\n\\begin{align}\n&U(z)\\land{}\\\\\n&\\forall x(U(x)\\to(U(G(x))\\land\\neg G(x)=z))\\land{}\\\\\n&\\forall x\\,\\forall y((U(x)\\land U(y)\\land G(x)=G(y))\\to x=y)\\land{}\\\\\n&\\forall X([X(z) \\land  \\forall x((U(x)\\land X(x)) \\to X(G(x)))] \\to {}\\\\\n&\\forall x(U(x)\\to X(x))),\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nThen \\((N,A,g,a)\\models\\theta_{\\textrm{PA}}(U,G,z)\\) if and only if\n\\((N,A,g,a)\\) is isomorphic to a structure \\((M,\\oN,s,0)\\) where\n\\(\\oN\\subseteq M\\) and \\(s(n)=n+1\\). Thus we have used second-order\nlogic to say that the U-part of any model of\n\\(\\theta_{\\textrm{PA}}(U,G,z)\\), together with the function G\nand the individual z are isomorphic to the natural numbers\n\\(\\oN\\) with their successor function and zero. There are many ways to\nsee that no first order sentence can have this property. For example,\nby the Compactness Theorem such a sentence would have also a\nnon-standard model where some element is different from each\nin the sequence z, \\(G(z)\\), \\(G(G(z))\\), \\(G(G(G(z)))\\),\n\\(\\ldots\\). Such a model cannot be isomorphic to the natural numbers\n\\(\\oN\\) with their successor function and zero. Hereupon we may\nconclude that the Compactness Theorem does not hold for second-order\nlogic in the form that it holds for first order logic.\n\nIn models of \\(\\theta_{\\textrm{PA}}(U,G,z)\\) the formula\n\\(\\theta_+(U,G,z,H)\\)  \n\n\\[\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\forall x(U(x)\\to H(x,z)=x)\\land\\\\\n\\forall x\\,\\forall y(U(x)\\to (U(y)\\to H(x,G(y))=G(H(x,y))))\\\\\n\\end{array}\\right.\n\\]\n\n\nand the formula \\(\\theta_\\times(U,G,z,H,J)\\)  \n\n\\[\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\forall x(U(x)\\to J(x,z)=z)\\land\\\\\n\\forall x\\,\\forall y(U(x)\\to (U(y)\\to J(x,G(y))=H(J(x,y),x)))\\\\\n\\end{array}\\right.\n\\]\n\n\ndefine unique functions \\(m+n=H(m,n)\\) and \\(m\\cdot n=J(m,n)\\). A\nfirst order sentence \\(\\phi(+,\\cdot,0)\\) of arithmetic is true in\n\\((\\oN,+,\\cdot,0)\\) if and only if  \n\n\\[\n\\forall U\\,\n\\forall G\\,\n\\forall z\\,\n\\forall H\\,\n\\forall J  \\left(\\left(\n\\theta_{\\textrm{PA}} (U,G,z) \n\\land \\theta_+(U,G,z,H)  \n          \\land \\theta_\\times(U,G,z,H,J)\n\\right)\n\\to {}\\\\\n(\\phi(H,J,z))^{U}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\nis valid. We know that truth of first order sentences in\n\\((\\oN,+,\\cdot,0)\\) is undecidable, and even non-arithmetical by\nresults of G\u00f6del (1931 [1986: 144\u2013195]) and Tarski (1933\n[1956]). This shows that second-order logic is not completely\naxiomatizable by effective means, or decidable even in the empty\nvocabulary. That is, there is no decidable second-order theory with an\ninfinite model. This is in sharp contrast to first order logic where\nthe following theories are decidable: first order logic with empty\nvocabulary, first order logic with monadic predicates, dense linear\norder, Pressburger arithmetic (first order theory of \\((\\oN,+,0)\\)),\nreal closed fields (first order theory of \\((\\oR,+,\\cdot,0,1)\\)),\ntheory of algebraically closed fields, and the first order theory of\n\\((\\oC,+,\\cdot,0,1)\\). In second-order logic none of the respective\nsecond-order theories are decidable. However, if we restrict\nsecond-order logic to monadic second-order logic, we obtain\nmany important decidable theories (see\n \u00a78).\n\n\n5.2 The collapse of the Completeness Theorem\n\nThe Completeness Theorem is one of the cornerstones of our\nunderstanding of first order logic. Also many extensions of first\norder logic have a Completeness Theorem, most notably the extension of\nfirst order logic by the\n generalized quantifier\n \u201cThere are uncountably many\u201d and the\n infinitary language\n \\(L_{\\omega_1\\omega}\\). We shall now see that there is no hope of a\nCompleteness Theorem for second-order logic. Later in\n \u00a79.1\n we shall modify the semantics so that a Completeness Theorem can be\nproved.\n\nBehind the failure of the Completeness Theorem is the fact that\nsecond-order logic is\u2014almost by definition\u2014able to say\nthat a set is the power set of another set. What this means is the\nfollowing: Let L be a vocabulary. Let E be a binary and\nU a unary relation symbol, both not in L. Let\n\\(\\theta_{\\textrm{Pow}}(U,E)\\) be the second-order formula\n(\\ref{ex6}). Let us consider the conjunction  \n\n\\[\\tag{8}\\label{papow}\n\\theta_{\\textrm{PA}}(U,G,z)\\land\\theta_{\\textrm{Pow}}(U,E).\n\\]\n\n\nModels of this formula are, up to isomorphism, of the form\n\\((M,\\in,N,g,a)\\), where \\(\\P(N)=M\\), \\(N\\cap\\P(N)=\\emptyset\\) and\n\\(N\\) is countably infinite. Thus the models are necessarily\nuncountable. This shows that second-order logic, unlike first order\nlogic, has sentences with models but only uncountable ones. Thus the\nDownward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem Theorem fails for second-order logic,\nas we already noted above. Combining (\\ref{papow}) with the\nobservations in\n \u00a75.1\n yields the following result (by validity we mean the set of\nG\u00f6del numbers of valid formulas):\n\n\nTheorem 3 (Hintikka 1955; Montague 1963) Validity in\nsecond-order logic is not second-order definable over\n\\((\\oN,+,\\cdot,0)\\).\n\n\nIn consequence, validity in second-order logic is not \\(\\Sigma^1_n\\)\nfor any n. Since building power sets in the style of\n\\(\\theta_{\\textrm{Pow}}(U,E)\\) can be iterated, we can see that\nvalidity in second-order logic is not \\(\\Sigma^m_n\\) for any m\nand n. We extend this result further below in\n Theorem 6.\n\n\n5.3 \u201cSet theory in sheep\u2019s clothing\u201d\n\nSecond-order logic hides in its semantics some of the most difficult\nproblems of set theory. In the words of Resnik (1988: 75):\n\n\nIn Philosophy of Logic [Quine 1970], W. V. Quine summed up a popular\nopinion among mathematical logicians by referring to second-order\nlogic as \u201cset theory in sheep\u2019s clothing\u201d.\n\n\nLet us see where this opinion might come from. First we observe that a\nvery simple, indeed a very basic, second-order formula can say that\ntwo sets have the same cardinality: Suppose P and R are\nunary relation variables. Let \\(\\theta_{\\le}(P,R)\\) be the formula\n \n\n\\[\n\\exists F\\left(\\forall x\\,\\forall y\\left(\n(F(x)=F(y)\\to x=y)\n\\land(P(x)\\to R(F(x))\n\\right)\\right).\n\\]\n\n\nNow \\(\\mm\\models_s\\theta_\\le(P,R)\\) if and only if \\(|s(P)|\\le |s(R)|\\).\nLet \\(\\theta_{\\textrm{EQ}}(P,R)\\) be the formula\n\\(\\theta_{{\\le}}(P,R)\\land \\theta_{{\\le}}(R,P)\\). Now\n\\(\\mm\\models_s\\phi(P,R)\\) if and only if \\(|s(P)|=|s(R)|\\). Let\n\\(\\theta'_{\\textrm{EC}}(Y)\\) be  \n\n\\[\n\\exists F\\left(\n\\forall x\\,\\forall y((F(x)=F(y)\\to x=y)\\land R(F(x)))\n \\land {}\\\\\n\\forall x\\,\\exists y(R(x)\\to x=F(y))\n\\right).\n\\]\n\n\nNow \\(\\mm\\models_s\\phi(P,R)\\) if and only if the sets M and\n\\(s(R)\\) have the same cardinality. We will use these formulas to\nlaunch an attack on the Continuum Hypothesis, the notorious problem of\nset theory, proved independent of ZFC by Cohen in 1963 (Cohen\n1966).\n\nLet \\(\\theta_{\\textrm{CH}}\\) be the sentence  \n\n\\[\n\\exists E\\,\\exists U\\,\\exists G\\,\\exists z\\left(\n\\theta_{\\textrm{Pow}}(E,U)\n\\land\\theta_{\\textrm{PA}}(U,G,z) \n\\land {}\\\\\n\\forall Y(\\theta'_{\\textrm{EC}}(Y)\\lor\\theta_{\\le}(Y,U))\n\\right). \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\n\nNow \\(\\theta_{\\textrm{CH}}\\), which is a sentence of the empty\nvocabulary, has a model if and only if the Continuum Hypothesis CH\nholds. Similarly, there is a sentence \\(\\theta_{\\neg \\textrm{CH}}\\),\nwhich has a model if and only if the Continuum Hypothesis CH does not\nhold. This shows that the dependence of the semantics of second-order\nlogic on the metatheoretic set theory is so deep that even questions\nthat ZFC cannot solve can determine the truth or falsity of a sentence\nin a model.\n\nThe curious quality of second-order logic is that the truth of a\nsentence such as \\(\\theta_{\\textrm{CH}}\\) in a big enough model of the\nempty vocabulary is equivalent to the truth of the Continuum\nHypothesis in the set-theoretical universe. By the same technique\nalmost any set-theoretical statement can be turned into a sentence of\nsecond-order logic, the truth of which in a big enough model of the\nempty vocabulary is equivalent to the truth of the statement in the\nset-theoretical universe. Somehow second-order logic manages to read\nthe background set theory correctly. Does this mean that second-order\nlogic is set theory in \u201csheep\u2019s clothing\u201d?\n\n\n5.4 Does second-order logic depend on the Axiom of Choice?\n\nThe Axiom of Choice (AC) is a philosophical puzzle in the foundations\nof mathematics. Roughly speaking, this axiom, that originally emerged\nin set theory, says that if we have a set \\(A\\) of non-empty disjoint\nsets, then we can form a new set \\(B\\) which contains exactly one\nelement from each set in \\(A\\). What can be seen as a problem is the\nfact that when \\(A\\) is infinite, forming the set \\(B\\) seems to\nrequire making an infinite number of choices. See entry on\n Axiom of Choice\n for a thorough definition and discussion. On the one hand the Axiom\nof Choice seems magic, for example when it implies that the wildest\nsets have a well-ordering. On the other hand it seems innocuous, for\nexample when it implies that the Cartesian product of a family of\nnon-empty sets is non-empty. The Axiom of Choice is typically used to\nconstruct odd \u201cparadoxical\u201d sets, such as a non-Lebesgue\nmeasurable set of real numbers, a well-ordering of the real numbers, a\nparadoxical decomposition of the sphere (see entry on\n set theory),\n and so on. Such sets are usually in one sense or another undefinable.\nFor example, a non-Lebesgue measurable set of real numbers\nhas to be undefinable in second-order logic over\n\\((\\oN,+,\\cdot)\\), if there are sufficiently large cardinals (see the\nentry on\n large cardinals and determinacy).\n\nThe puzzling Axiom of Choice arises also in the middle of second-order\nlogic: Let \\(\\theta\\) be the sentence  \n\n\\[\n\\forall X(\\forall x\\,\\exists y\\,X(x,y)\\to\\exists F\\,\\forall x\\,X(x,F(x))).\n\\]\n\n\nThen \\(\\oR\\models\\theta\\) essentially says that if a binary relation\n\\(X\\) relates to each \\(x\\in\\oR\\) a non-empty set \\(\\{y\\in\\oR :\nX(x,y\\}\\), then there is a function \\(F\\) which chooses for each\n\\(x\\in\\oR\\) some \\(y=F(x)\\) such that \\(X(x,y)\\). In set theory this\nis one of many equivalent ways of saying that the Axiom of Choice\nholds for (continuum size) families of subsets of \\(\\oR\\). The basic\ntenet of second-order logic is that \u201call\u201d properties of\nelements of a fixed domain exist and we can quantify over them. In\nset-theoretical terms this means that all subsets, definable or not,\nof a set of any cardinality exists and we can quantify over them. In\nthis spirit the Axiom of Choice seems innocent and is usually accepted\nin the literature of second-order logic.\n\nBy Cohen\u2019s results (1966) there are N and \\(N'\\)\nsatisfying the axioms of ZF (without the Axiom of Choice) such that\n\u201c\\(\\oN\\models\\theta\\)\u201d holds in N but does not hold\nin \\(N'\\). This is a further demonstration of the dependence of the\nsemantics of second-order logic on the metatheory.\n\n\n6. Non-Absoluteness of Truth in Second-Order Logic\n\nAbsoluteness is one of the most important concepts of logic. It was\nused already in 1939 by G\u00f6del in his analysis of the hierarchy of\nconstructible sets (1939 [1990: 46]) towards proving the consistency\nof the Continuum Hypothesis. It is briefly mentioned by G\u00f6del\nthree years earlier in connection with the notion of computability\n(1936 [1986: 397]).\n\nIntuitively speaking, a concept is absolute if its meaning is\nindependent of the formalism used, or in other words, if its meaning\nin the formal sense is the same as its meaning in the \u201creal\nworld\u201d. This may sound very vague and inexact. However,\nabsoluteness has a perfectly exact technical definition in set\ntheory.\n\nRecall that a set a is called transitive if every\nelement of an element of a is an element of a. A\ntransitive model is a model \\((M,\\in)\\) such that M is\ntransitive. By the Mostowski Collapsing Lemma (Mostowski 1949) every\nwell-founded model \\((M,E)\\) of the Axiom of Extensionality is\nisomorphic to a transitive model. A basic property of transitive\nmodels \\((M,\\in)\\) is that if \\(a,b\\in M\\), then \\(M\\models a\\subseteq\nb\\) if and only if \\(a\\subseteq b\\). (If all elements of a that\nare in M are in b then all elements of a are in\nb, as by transitivity of M, elements of a are\nnecessarily elements of M.) We could express this by saying\nthat the formula \\(x\\subseteq y\\) is absolute in transitive models.\nMore generally, we say that a formula \\(\\phi(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) of the\nfirst order language of set theory is absolute relative to\nZFC if there is a finite \\(T\\subseteq \\ZFC\\) such that for all\ntransitive models \\((M,\\in)\\) of T and all \\(a_1,\\ldots,a_n\\in\nM\\) we have  \n\n\\[\\phi(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)\\text{ if and only if }(M,\\in)\\models\\phi(a_1,\\ldots,a_n).\n\\]\n\n\nThis definition of absoluteness is equivalent to the following more\nsyntactic condition (Feferman & Kreisel 1966): there are a\n\\(\\Sigma_1\\)-formula \\(\\exists y\\,\\psi(y,x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) and a\n\\(\\Pi_1\\)-formula \\(\\forall y\\,\\theta(y,x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) such that\n \n\n\\[\\ZFC\\vdash\\forall x_1\\ldots\\forall x_n(\\phi(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\leftrightarrow \\exists y\\,\\psi(y,x_1,\\ldots,x_n))\n\\]\n\n\nand  \n\n\\[\\ZFC\\vdash\\forall x_1\\ldots\\forall x_n(\\phi(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\leftrightarrow \\forall y\\,\\theta(y,x_1,\\ldots,x_n)).\n\\]\n\n\nIn such a case we say that \\(\\phi(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is\n\\(\\Delta_1^{\\text{ZFC}}\\).\n\nFor first order logic it can be proved that\n\u201c\\(\\mm\\models_s\\phi\\)\u201d is an absolute property of \\(\\mm\\),\ns and \\(\\phi\\) relative to ZFC. In fact, this is true even if\nZFC is replaced by the weaker Kripke-Platek set theory KP (see Barwise\n1972a). The usual Tarski Truth Definition of first order logic can be\nwritten in \\(\\Delta_1^{\\text{ZFC}}\\) form. For second-order logic the\npropositions \u201c\\(\\phi\\) is a second-order formula\u201d,\n\u201c\\(\\mm\\) is an L-structure\u201d and \u201cs is\nan assignment\u201d are all absolute relative to ZFC as well, but\n\u201c\\(\\mm\\models_s\\phi\\)\u201d is not, as we shall now see. This\nis a crucial property of second-order logic. One may consider it a\nweakness, if one thinks of absoluteness as a desirable property, or a\nstrength, if one takes non-absoluteness as a sign of expressive power.\nWhether a weakness or not, it is an important feature of second-order\nlogic and a dominating topic in discussions about it. Second-order\nlogic is, however, not the only non-absolute logic. For example,\n\\(L(Q_1)\\) (see the entry on\n generalized quantifiers)\n and \\(L_{\\omega_1\\omega_1}\\) (see then entry on\n infinitary languages)\n are non-absolute, while \\(L(Q_0)\\) and \\(L_{\\omega_1\\omega}\\) are\nabsolute. The reason why \\(L(Q_0)\\) is absolute is essentially that\nthe property of a set being infinite is absolute in transitive models\nof ZFC. Although the set of sentences of \\(L_{\\omega_1\\omega}\\) may\nvary from one transitive model of ZFC to another, the truth of a\nsentence of \\(L_{\\omega_1\\omega}\\) in a model is absolute in\ntransitive models of ZFC essentially because the truth has a simple\ninductive definition which only refers to subformulas of the sentence\nand elements of the model.\n\nRecall the definition of the sentence \\(\\theta_{\\textrm{EC}}(P,R)\\) in\n \u00a75.3,\n which says that the interpretations of the predicates P and\nR have the same cardinality. Cardinality is not an absolute\nproperty. Two sets (even two ordinals) can be of different cardinality\nin one transitive model of ZFC and of the same cardinality in a\ntransitive extension. It is easy to see that \u201c\\(\\mm\\models_s\\theta_{\\textrm{EC}}(P,R)\\)\u201d\nis not absolute relative to ZFC. Essentially, the reason is that two\nsets have the same cardinality if there is a bijection between them.\nIn a small transitive set it may happen that the sets are there but\nthe bijection manifesting their equicardinality is not. The bijection\nmay be one obtained by the method of forcing. Or the lack of the\nbijection may be the result of applying the Downward\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\n Theorem[6].\n\nA more serious case of non-absoluteness is the sentence\n\\(\\theta_{\\textrm{CH}}\\) of\n \u00a75.3.\n The sentence \\(\\theta_{\\textrm{CH}}\\) of the empty vocabulary has a\nmodel if and only if the Continuum Hypothesis is true. If \\(T\\subseteq\n\\ZFC\\) is finite, then there are countable transitive models\n\\(M\\subseteq M'\\) such that one, say M, satisfies CH and the\nother, in this case \\(M'\\), does not (by Cohen 1966). In M the\nsentence \\(\\theta_{\\textrm{CH}}\\) has a model \\(\\ma\\), that is,\n\\(M\\models\n\\textrm{\u201c}\\ma\\models\\theta_{\\textrm{CH}}\\textrm{\u201d}\\). In\n\\(M'\\) the same sentence has no models, in particular \\(M'\\not\\models\n\\textrm{\u201c}\\ma\\models\\theta_{\\textrm{CH}}\\textrm{\u201d}\\). Thus\nthe property of a model satisfying a second-order sentence is not\nabsolute relative to ZFC. Even the property of a second-order sentence\nhaving a model is not absolute relative to ZFC, because in\nM the sentence \\(\\theta_{\\textrm{CH}}\\) has a model but in\n\\(M'\\) not. For first order logic the property of a sentence of having\na model is co-re and therefore arithmetical. Arithmetical properties\nare always absolute relative to ZFC. The situation is similar if the\nContinuum Hypothesis is replaced by the Axiom of Choice (see\n \u00a75.4).\n\nThe CH and the AC are central questions of set theory and subjects of\ncontinuing debate. While the AC is mostly accepted as an axiom, and is\npart of the ZFC axiom system, the CH is widely considered an open\nproblem. There are even suggestions (e.g., Feferman 1999) that it\ncannot be solved by any axiom system with the kind of general\nacceptance that ZFC has. The formalist position in the foundations of\nmathematics goes further and maintains that the question, what the\ntruth value of CH is, is meaningless. Both CH and its negation are\nconsistent with ZFC, assuming ZFC itself is consistent. According to\nthe formalist position the status of CH has been solved with this. The\nsemantics of second-order logic depending on these hard questions of\nset theory puts second-order logic into the same \u201cbasket\u201d\nwith set theory. Criticism of set theory becomes criticism of\nsecond-order logic and vice versa.\n\nAnother indication of the dependence of second-order logic on set\ntheory as the metatheory is the result of Barwise to the effect that\nthe existence of the Hanf number of second-order logic is not provable\nin set theory without a highly complex use of the Replacement Axiom\n(for details, see Barwise 1972b).\n\n\n7. Model Theory of Second-Order Logic\n\nLet us start by noting that there are some trivial consequences of\nsecond-order logic being able to quantify over relations. For example,\nthe Craig Interpolation Theorem holds for second-order logic for\ntrivial reasons: If the finite relational vocabulary of \\(\\phi\\) is\nL, the finite relational vocabulary of \\(\\phi'\\) is \\(L'\\) and\n\\(\\models\\phi\\to\\phi',\\) then there is \\(\\theta\\) such that\n\\(\\models\\phi\\to\\theta\\text{ and } \\models\\theta\\to\\phi'\\) and the\nvocabulary of \\(\\theta\\) is \\(L\\cap L'\\), because we can let\n\\(\\theta\\) be the sentence \\(\\exists X_1\\ldots\\exists X_n\\,\\phi\\),\nwhere \\(L\\setminus L'=\\{X_1,\\ldots, X_n\\}\\). We can additionally\ndemand that every predicate symbol occurring positively in \\(\\theta\\)\noccurs positively in \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\), and every predicate symbol\noccurring negatively in \\(\\theta\\) occurs negatively in \\(\\phi\\) and\n\\(\\psi\\) (the Lyndon Interpolation Theorem [Lyndon 1959]). In\nthe same way the Beth Definability Theorem holds for trivial reasons,\nalso some preservation\n results[7]\n have a trivial proof. For a negative result, see Craig 1965.\n\nHowever, second-order logic does not have a model theory in the same\nsense as first order logic does. There is no Compactness Theorem to\nproduce non-standard models. One reason why first order logic has such\na rich model theory is that first order logic is relatively weak.\nCountable first order theories that have infinite models have models\nof all infinite cardinalities. This is a consequence of a weakness of\nfirst order logic: its sentences cannot limit the size of the model\nunless the size is finite. In model theory this weakness is turned to\na strength: the structure of models of first order theories can be\nanalyzed in interesting ways. See the entry on\n model theory\n for examples of this.\n\nSecond-order theories can typically have just one model up to\nisomorphism. Thus if we investigate the class of models of a\nsecond-order sentence, the class may very well consist of just one\nmodel, up to isomorphism. With just one model one cannot really\ndevelop a model theory. One ends up investigating the one and only\nmodel and there are no compelling reasons to use logic in the study of\nit. If the one and only model is an algebraic structure, one should\nuse algebra to study it. If it is an ordered structure, one should use\nthe general theory of ordered structures to study it, and so on. It is\nunlikely that being second-order characterizable (see\n \u00a77.1)\n tells much about the structure. It reveals more about second-order\nlogic in general. For example, being able to characterize the\nstructure of natural numbers means that the Compactness Theorem and\nthe Completeness Theorem fail. Being able to characterize the ordered\nfield of real numbers means that both the Downward and the Upward\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem Theorems fail. It is from this\nperspective\u2014to understand second-order logic itself\u2014that\nit is interesting to know exactly which structures are second-order\ncharacterizable up to isomorphism.\n\nLet us finally compare the two hierarchies, the model theoretic\nhierarchy \\(\\Sigma_n^1\\cup\\Pi_n^1\\) inside second-order logic and the\nLevy hierarchy \\(\\Sigma_n\\cup\\Pi_n\\) in set theory.\n\n\nTheorem 4\n\nThe set of G\u00f6del numbers of valid second-order sentences is\nthe complete \\(\\Pi_2\\)-set of natural numbers. (Tharp 1973)\nThe L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem number of second-order logic is the\nsupremum of all \\(\\Pi_2\\)-definable ordinals. (Krawczyk & Marek\n1977)\nThe Hanf number of second-order logic is the supremum of all\n\\(\\Sigma_2\\)-definable ordinals. (Krawczyk & Marek 1977)\nEvery model class which is definable in second-order logic is\n\\(\\Delta_2\\)-definable in set theory. (V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen\n1979)\n\n\n\nIn the light of the above theorem second-order logic sits firmly on\nthe \\(\\Sigma_2\\cup\\Pi_2\\)-level of set theoretic definability. This is\na reason to consider second-order logic weaker than first\norder set theory. This sounds paradoxical. How can second-order logic,\nwith all the power and non-first order properties it has, be weaker\nthan first order logic based set theory, when first order logic cannot\neven express finiteness, countability, uncountability, and so on?\nNevertheless the message of\n Theorem 4\n is undeniable. Perhaps this would not be so puzzling if we thought of\nset theory as a very high order logic over the singleton of the empty\nset. After all, set theory permits endless iterations of the power set\noperation, while second-order logic permits only one iteration.\n\nWe start below with a subsection on models that can be characterized\nin second-order logic by one sentence up to isomorphism. Another\napproach to the model theory of second-order logic is to focus on\nmodels with large cardinal (inaccessible, measurable,\nsupercompact cardinals) properties. This is the topic of\n \u00a77.2.\n Finally, in\n \u00a77.3\n we consider the possibility of allowing the so-called general models\nintroduced in\n \u00a79.1.\n In this case second-order logic becomes very much like first order\nlogic. However, general models are mostly interesting when they are\nso-called Henkin models, i.e., they satisfy the so-called\nComprehension Axioms. In Henkin models second-order logic satisfies\nthe Compactness Theorem and other principles familiar from first order\nmodel theory but no general structure- or classification theory exists\nyet, perhaps because the Comprehension Axioms bring in a lot of\ncomplicated structure into the models.\n\n7.1 Second-order characterizable structures\n\nA structure \\(\\ma\\) is second-order characterizable if there\nis a second-order sentence \\(\\theta_\\ma\\) such that\n\\(\\mb\\models\\theta_\\ma\\iff\\mb\\cong\\ma\\) for all structures \\(\\mb\\) of\nthe same vocabulary as \\(\\ma\\).\n\n\nExample 5: The following structures are second-order\ncharacterizable:\n\nNatural numbers: \\((\\oN,+,\\cdot)\\).\nReal numbers: \\((\\oR,+,\\cdot,0,1)\\).\nComplex numbers: \\((\\oC,+,\\cdot,0,1)\\).\nThe first uncountable ordinal \\((\\omega_1,<)\\).\nThe level \\((V_\\kappa,\\in)\\) of the cumulative hierarchy, where\n\\(\\kappa\\) is the first strongly inaccessible cardinal\n\\(>\\omega\\).\nThe well-order \\((\\kappa,<)\\) of the first weakly compact\ncardinal \\(>\\omega\\).\n\n\n\nAre all structures second-order characterizable? There are\nonly countably many second-order sentences, hence only countably many\n(up to isomorphism) second-order characterizable structures. Therefore\nthere are lots of structures of every infinite cardinality which are\nnot second-order characterizable. However, it is not easy to give\nexamples. One example is \\((\\kappa,<)\\), where \\(\\kappa\\) is the\nfirst measurable cardinal (\\(>\\omega\\)). See\n \u00a77.2\n for an explanation. Another example is \\((\\oN,<,A)\\), where\nA is the set of G\u00f6del numbers of valid second-order\nsentences in the vocabulary of one binary relation. For an\nexplanation, see\n \u00a77.2.\n One may ask whether there is an example which arises from\nmathematical practice outside of mathematical logic. What about\n\\((\\oR,+,\\times,<,A)\\), where A is a Hamel basis (a basis\nfor the vector space where the reals are the vectors, rationals are\nthe scalars and vector addition is the usual addition of reals)? It is\nconsistent, relative to the consistency of ZF that no such structure\n\\((\\oR,+,\\times,<,A)\\) is second-order characterizable (Hyttinen,\nKangas, & V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2013).\n\nA special property of second-order characterizable structures is that\ntheir reducts are also second-order characterizable, because we can\nuse existential second-order quantifiers to \u201cguess\u201d the\nmissing relations and functions. Therefore it is interesting to find\ncharacterizable structures that have as many (but only finitely many)\nrelations and functions as possible. We can endow \\(\\oN\\) with any\nfinite number of recursive functions \\(f_1,\\ldots, f_n \\) and\nrelations \\(R_1,\\ldots, R_m\\) obtaining the structure\n\\((\\oN,f_1,\\ldots, f_n,R_1,\\ldots, R_m)\\) and this is second-order\ncharacterizable. We can endow \\(\\oR\\) with any familiar analytic\nfunctions such as trigonometric functions or any other functions given\nby a convergent power series the coefficients of which are given by a\nrecursive function, and the result is second-order\ncharacterizable.\n\nIt is easy to see that the second-order theory of a second-order\ncharacterizable structure \\(\\ma\\) is Turing-reducible to the\nsecond-order theory of any bigger second-order characterizable\nstructure \\(\\mb\\), as for all second-order \\(\\phi\\):  \n\n\\[\\ma\\models\\phi\\iff\\mb\\models\\exists P(\\theta_\\ma^{P}\\land\\phi^{P}).\n\\]\n\n\nThe bigger the characterizable structure is, the more complex is the\nsecond-order theory. That there is no largest characterizable\nstructure can be seen as follows: If \\(\\ma\\) is second-order\ncharacterizable, then so is the reduct of \\(\\ma\\) to the empty\n vocabulary[8],\n that is, the cardinality \\(|A|\\) of \\(\\ma\\) is characterizable. Such\ncardinal numbers were studied by Garland (1974). For example, if\n\\(\\kappa\\) is characterizable, then so are \\(\\kappa^+\\) and\n\\(2^\\kappa\\).\n\nIf \\(\\phi\\) is a second-order sentence, we define  \n\n\\[\\Mod(\\phi)=\\{\\mm: \\mm\\models\\phi\\}.\n\\]\n\n\nIf \\(\\phi\\) characterizes a model \\(\\ma\\), then \\(\\Mod(\\phi)\\) is just\nthe class of models isomorphic to \\(\\ma\\). If we look at\n\\(\\Mod(\\phi)\\) from the perspective of set theory, we know it is\n\\(\\Delta_2\\)\n (Theorem 4).\n On the other hand, the set of G\u00f6del numbers of valid\nsecond-order sentences is \\(\\Pi_2\\)-complete\n (Theorem 4),\n hence not \\(\\Sigma_2\\) and in particular, not \\(\\Delta_2\\). This\ncontemplation leads us to the following extension of\n Theorem 3\n above:\n\n\nTheorem 6 (V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2012) Second-order\nvalidity is not second-order definable on any second-order\ncharacterizable structure.\n\n\nThis raises the question, how can we understand second-order validity\nfrom the second-order perspective? In view of the above theorem we\ncannot understand second-order validity as something that can be\nexpressed in second-order logic on some structure which itself can be\ncharacterized in second-order logic. The reference to set theory seems\ninevitable in understanding second-order validity. Let us discuss what\nthis might mean from the point of view of structuralism. Parsons\ndefines structuralism as follows:\n\n\nBy the \u201cstructuralist view\u201d of mathematical objects, I\nmean the view that reference to mathematical objects is always in the\ncontext of some background structure, and that the objects involved\nhave no more to them than can be expressed in terms of the basic\nrelations of the structure. (Parsons 1990: 303)\n\n\nStructuralism in this sense (for other kinds of structuralism, see,\ne.g., Hellman 2001) seems to fit well into the second-order logic\nframework. Contrary to set theory, second-order logic always assumes\nan underlying (limited) structure which is supposed to reflect one\nparticular aspect of mathematics such as the semi-ring of natural\nnumbers, the ordered field of real numbers, the field of complex\nnumbers, the well-ordered structure \\((\\omega_1,<)\\), and so on.\nIdeally, these underlying structures are second-order characterizable.\nThis leads to a problem with universal truths such as validity, but\nalso with less complex ones such as the statement that every linear\norder has a completion, or that every field has an algebraic closure.\nSuch universal truths are not about any particular structure.\n\n\n7.2 Second-order logic and large cardinals\n\nWe refer to the SEP entries\n independence and large cardinals\n and\n large cardinals and determinacy\n for the definition of concepts related to large cardinals.\n\nThe following early result on the connection between model theory of\nsecond-order logic and large cardinals is a model for other more\ndelicate results. It is a kind of Downward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\nTheorem for second-order logic. It says that if a second-order\nsentence has a model of the cardinality of a measurable cardinal, then\nit has a smaller submodel:\n\n\nTheorem 7 (Scott 1961) Suppose \\(\\kappa\\) is a\nmeasurable cardinal. If \\(\\phi\\) is a second-order sentence and\n\\(\\phi\\) has a model \\(\\mm\\) of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\), then for every\n\\(X\\subseteq M\\) of cardinality \\(<\\kappa\\) there is\n\\(\\mn\\subseteq\\mm\\) such that \\(X\\subseteq N\\), \\(|N|\\kappa\\), and \\(\\mn\\models\\phi\\).\n [9]\n\n\n\nA particular consequence is that the first measurable cardinal cannot\nbe second-order characterizable as a model of the empty vocabulary (a\nfact that was referred to above in\n \u00a77.1).\n Theorem 7 resembles remarkably the Downward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\nTheorem of first order logic. The only difference is that one has to\nstart with a big model, a model of the size of a measurable cardinal.\nSmaller cardinals need not work. For example, if \\(\\lambda\\) is the\nleast weakly compact cardinal \\(>\\omega\\), then there is a sentence\n\\(\\phi\\) which has \\(\\lambda\\) (with the empty vocabulary) as a model\nbut no smaller models. The\n sentence[10]\n \\(\\phi\\) says that \\(\\lambda\\) is inaccessible (\\(>\\omega\\)) and\nthat every \\(\\lambda\\)-tree (a tree of height \\(\\lambda\\) with all\nlevels of size \\(<\\lambda\\)) has a branch of length\n\\(\\lambda\\).\n\nIf we want to obtain a Downward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem Theorem which\nworks for any structure, not only for structures of a measurable\ncardinality, we have to look at even bigger cardinals: The\nLST-number of second-order logic is defined to be the least\n(if any exist) \\(\\kappa\\) such that if \\(\\ma\\) is any structure and\n\\(\\phi\\) is a second-order sentence true in \\(\\ma\\), then there is a\nsubstructure \\(\\mb\\) of \\(\\ma\\) of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\) which also satisfies \\(\\phi.\\)\n\n\nTheorem 8 (Magidor 1971) The LST-number of\nsecond-order logic exists if and only if there are supercompact\ncardinals \\(>\\omega\\) and then it is the smallest of them.\n\n\nSecond-order logic is said to satisfy strong\n\\(\\kappa\\)-compactness if every second-order theory, every\nsubset of size \\(<\\kappa\\) of which has a model, has itself a\nmodel.\n\n\nTheorem 9 (Magidor 1971) The least \\(\\kappa\\) such\nthat second-order logic satisfies the strong \\(\\kappa\\)-compactness\nis the least extendible\ncardinal.\n\n\n\n7.3 The model theory of general and Henkin models\n\nThe situation changes completely if we adopt so-called general models\n (\u00a79.1).\n With general models second-order logic has similar model theoretic\nproperties as first order logic, as it can simply be thought of as\nmany sorted first order logic (see\n \u00a79.1\n and Manzano 1996). By and large, results of many-sorted first order\nlogic translate immediately to second-order logic.\n\n\n\n8. Decidability Results\n\nThe second-order theory of even the empty vocabulary is undecidable,\nas we noted in\n \u00a75.1.\n In contrast, monadic second-order logic gives rise to many\nimportant decidability results. Let us first observe that (not only in\nthe empty vocabulary but also) in a monadic vocabulary, i.e., one\nconsisting of monadic predicates only, monadic second-order logic is\ncertainly decidable as proved already in 1915 by L\u00f6wenheim (1915)\nin one of the earliest papers on the mathematical aspects of formal\nlogic. L\u00f6wenheim\u2019s result can be proved easily by\nquantifier elimination, or alternatively by the more recent method of\nEhrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9-games (see\n \u00a73).\n However, monadic third (and higher) order logic in monadic\nvocabulary, with quantifiers over not only subsets and also over sets\nof subsets of the domain, is undecidable (Tharp 1973). We now focus on\nvocabularies which are not merely monadic.\n\nCompared to a monadic vocabulary, the other extreme can be described\nas follows: Let P be a ternary predicate (a \u201cpairing\nfunction\u201d) on a non-empty set S. Suppose that for every\n\\(x,y\\in S\\) there is \\(z\\in S\\) with \\((x, y, z) \\in P\\) and for\nevery \\(z\\in S\\) there is at most one pair \\((x, y)\\) with \\((x, y, z)\n\\in P\\). Then the true (full) second-order theory of S is\ninterpretable in the monadic theory of \\((S, P)\\) (Gurevich 1985). In\nother words, in a context where a pairing function is present, as in\nset theory and number theory, no special advantage arises from\nlimiting second-order logic to its monadic fragment.\n\nThe next step from a vocabulary consisting of only monadic predicates\nis a vocabulary with exactly one unary function. To describe some\nhighly non-trivial results in this case we introduce the following\nconcept, which has independent interest: The spectrum of a\nfirst or second-order sentence is the set of cardinalities of its\nfinite models. Spectra were introduced by Scholz, see Durand, Jones,\nMakowsky, and More (2012) for a history. A spectrum is of course\nalways recursive. In fact, a set of natural numbers is a spectrum of a\nfirst order sentence iff it is in NEXPTIME, that is, recognizable by a\nnondeterministic Turing machine in exponential time (Jones &\nSelman 1974). In the case of sentences with just one unary function\nsymbol there is a surprising characterization. Let us call a set\nS of natural numbers eventually periodic if there are\nnatural numbers N and p with \\(p > 0\\) such that for\nevery n with \\(n > N\\), we have \\(n \\in S\\) iff \\(n +p \\in\nS\\).\n\n\nTheorem 10 (Durand, Fagin, & Loescher 1998; Shelah\n2004) Suppose the vocabulary has just one unary function.\nThen a set of natural numbers is the spectrum of a monadic\nsecond-order sentence if and only if it is the spectrum of a first\norder sentence if and only if it is eventually periodic.\n\n\nIn graphs monadic second-order logic can still express most\ninteresting properties. For example, the connectivity of the\ngraph (here E is the edge relation) can be expressed by the\nsentence  \n\n\\[\\forall X((\\exists x\\,X(x)\\land\\forall x\\forall y((X(x)\\land xEy)\\to\nX(y)))\\to\\forall x\\,X(x)) \\]\n\n\nand the 3-colorability of the graph by the sentence \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n&\\exists X\\,\\exists Y\\,\\exists Z ( \\forall x(\nX(x)\n\\lor Y(x)\n\\lor Z(x)\n)\\land{}\\\\\n&\\quad\\forall x\\,\\forall y ((\n(X(x)\\land X(y))\n\\lor(Y(x)\\land Y(y))\n\\lor(Z(x)\\land Z(y))\n)\\to{}\\\\\n&\\quad\\neg xEy))\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThere is a wealth of decidability results of monadic second-order\nlogic on linear orders, trees and graphs.\n\n\nTheorem 11 (B\u00fcchi 1962; Elgot 1961; Rabin 1968)\nThe monadic second-order theory of \\((\\oN,s)\\), i.e., the successor\nfunction on \\(\\oN\\) and of the full infinite binary tree, i.e., two\nsuccessor functions on \\(\\oN\\), are both decidable.\n\n\nThe proof goes via a reduction to automata. An automaton is a\nrestricted form of a Turing machine. In an automaton the machine never\nwrites on the tape, so the tape just contains the input (Rabin &\nScott 1959). However, the computation may be infinite. The input is\nconsidered accepted in the case of an infinite computation if\nan accepting state is reached infinitely many times. (There are also\nmore complicated criteria of acceptance). With monadic second-order\nlogic we can guess an accepting computation of the automaton. It is\npossible but more difficult to show that an automaton can check the\ntruth of a monadic second-order sentence. The monadic second-order\ntheory of ordinals \\((\\alpha,<)\\) have been studied extensively\nfrom the point of view of decidability. For example, the monadic\nsecond-order theory of all countable ordinals, the theory of\n\\(\\omega_1\\), and the theory of all ordinals \\(<\\omega_2\\) are\ndecidable (B\u00fcchi 1973), but ZFC cannot decide whether the monadic\nsecond-order theory of \\(\\omega_2\\) is decidable (Gurevich, Magidor,\n& Shelah 1983).\n\n\n9. Axioms of Second-Order Logic\nRecall our convention: Whenever we use upper case Fraktur letters,\nsuch as \\(\\ma,\\mb,\\mm,\\mn\\) etc, to name a structure, we use the upper\ncase Italic versions of those letters, such as \\(A,B,M,N\\) etc, to\nname the domain of the structure.\n\nThe deductive system of second-order logic, presented first explicitly\nin Hilbert-Ackermann (Hilbert & Ackermann 1938), is based on the\nobvious extension of axioms and rules of first order logic together\nwith the Comprehension Axiom Schema, defined as follows:\nSuppose \\(\\phi(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is a second-order formula with\n\\(x_1,\\ldots, x_n\\) among its free individual variables and the\nsecond-order variable R is not free in \\(\\phi\\). Then\nthe following formula is an instance of the Comprehension Axiom\nSchema:  \n\n\\[\\tag{10}\\label{CA} \\exists R\\,\\forall x_1\\ldots x_n(\\phi(x_1,\\ldots,\nx_n)\\leftrightarrow R(x_1,\\ldots, x_n)).  \\]\n\n\nThere is a similar schema for second-order formulas that define a\nfunction but we omit it here.\n\nAn example of a very simple second-order inference in number theory\nwould be  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dfrac{2+5<9}{\\exists R\\ R(2+5,9)}}{\\exists F\\,\\exists R\\ R(F(2,5),9)}\n\\]\n\n\nA priori (\\ref{CA}) might appear very strong as it stipulates the\nexistence of a relation. However, such an R seems reasonable to\naccept because it is definable:  \n\n\\[R=\\{(a_1\\ldots a_n) \\in M^n: \\mm\\models \\phi(a_1,\\ldots, a_n)\\}.\n\\]\n\n\nOur Comprehension Axiom Schema is impredicative in the sense\nthat the bound n-ary relation variables which may potentially\noccur in the formula \\(\\phi(a_1,\\ldots, a_n)\\) have R in their\nrange. In this sense second-order logic is utterly impredicative. The\nComprehension Axiom Schema has weaker forms that are less\nimpredicative. In the Arithmetic Comprehension Schema we\nassume \\(\\phi(a_1,\\ldots, a_n)\\) is first order. In the\n\\(\\Pi^1_1\\)-Comprehension Schema we assume \\(\\phi(a_1,\\ldots, a_n)\\)\nis \\(\\Pi^1_1\\). In mathematical practice these two weaker principles\nusually suffice, see Simpson (1999 [2009]) and\n \u00a714.\n\nHilbert-Ackermann (1938) added to the proof system of second-order\nlogic also two different schemas that they call Axioms of\nChoice. We are used to thinking of the Axiom of Choice as a\nset-theoretical principle. But second-order logic has the same\nsituation with choice principles as set theory. It makes perfect sense\nin second-order logic to ask whether there is a well-order of the\ndomain. The existence of such a well-order does in general not follow\nfrom the Comprehension Schema because the well-order may be---and is\nlikely to be---undefinable. So the only way to get a well-order of,\nsay, the real numbers, in second-order logic is to assume some form of\nsecond-order Axiom of Choice. The first choice principle is \n\n\\[\\tag{AC}\\forall x_1\\ldots x_m\\exists\nx_{m+1}\\, R(x_1,\\ldots, x_{m+1}) \\rightarrow {}\\\\ \\exists F\\,\\forall\nx_1\\ldots\\forall x_m\\, R(x_1,\\ldots, x_m, F(x_1\\ldots x_m))\\]\n\n\nand the second is  \n\n\\[\\tag{AC\u2032} \\forall x_1\\ldots x_m\\exists F\\,\\varphi\\rightarrow\\exists\nF'\\,\\forall x_1\\ldots x_m\\varphi', \\]\n\n\nwhere the formula \\(\\varphi'\\) is obtained from the formula\n\\(\\varphi\\) by replacing everywhere \\(F(t_1,\\ldots, t_k)\\) by\n\\(F'(t_1\\ldots t_k,x_1,\\ldots, x_m)\\).\n\nThe first Axiom of Choice (AC) says intuitively that if a set \n\n\\[\\{a_{n+1}\\in M : \\mm\\models R(a_1,\\ldots,a_n, a_{n+1})\\}\n\\]\n\n\nis non-empty, then there is a function which picks an element\n\\(a_{n+1}\\) from the set, using the parameters \\(a_1,\\ldots,a_{n}\\) as\narguments. The second Axiom of Choice (AC\u2032) is a kind of\nsecond-order choice: We have for all \\(a_1,\\ldots,a_n\\) a function\nF with the property \\(\\phi\\), so in fact F depends on\n\\(a_1,\\ldots, a_n\\) and should be denoted \\(F_{a_1\\ldots a_n}\\). What\n(AC\u2032) says now is that we can collect the functions\n\\(F_{a_1\\ldots a_n}\\) together to form just one function \\(F'\\) of\nhigher arity such that  \n\n\\[F'(a_1,\\ldots,a_{n+1})=F_{a_1\\ldots a_n}(a_{n+1}).\n\\]\n\n\nAlthough \\(F'\\) appears to be definable, this is not the case, as the\nmapping  \n\n\\[(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)\\mapsto F_{a_1\\ldots a_n}\n\\]\n\n\nmay be highly undefinable.\n\nNaturally, we may also want to assume the Well-ordering\nPrinciple which states that there is a binary relation which is a\ntotal order on the individuals and satisfies the condition that every\nnon-empty set of individuals has a least element in the order. It is\neasy to see that this principle implies (AC\u2032). In ZFC there are\nhundreds of equivalent formulations of the Axiom of Choice or weaker\nversions of it. Most of the formulations that are equivalent in ZFC\nare non-equivalent in second-order logic. This is because set theory\nallows free movement between sets and their power sets, but\nsecond-order logic does\n not[11].\n To obtain similar equivalence proofs as in set theory, one would have\nto move between second-order logic and third order logic, see\nGa\u00dfner (1994).\n\n9.1 General models and Henkin models\n\nThe concept of \u201cgeneral model\u201d was introduced by Henkin\n(1950) in order to obtain a Completeness Theorem for second-order\nlogic. General models are not the intended models of the axioms in the\nsense that bound relation and function variables do not range in these\nmodels over all relations and functions, only over a\ncollection of them. The generally accepted attitude towards them is\nthat they are not what one wants but they are necessary for obtaining\na smooth theory. They are like irrational numbers in calculus: it\nwould be ideal if all lengths that we encounter in calculus (or\ngeometry) were commensurable, but that is not how things turned out.\nSome lengths are incommensurable, and we end up accepting irrational\nnumbers in order to have a smooth general theory of lengths and their\nproportions. General models can be also compared to transitive models\nof set theory. One transitive model may say one thing is true, another\nsays just the opposite is true. But together the transitive models\nhelp us understand the axioms of set theory. The current methods in\nthe metamathematical investigation of the axioms of set theory, namely\ninner models and forcing extensions, all use transitive models of set\ntheory in an essential way. Similarly general models of second-order\nlogic help us investigate metamathematical properties of second-order\nlogic and its axioms.\n\n\nDefinition 12 A general model is a pair\n\\((\\mm,\\G)\\), where \\(\\mm\\) is a usual L-structure and \\(\\G\\)\nis a set of subsets, relations (of any arity) and functions (of any\narity) on M. In monadic second-order logic \\(\\G\\) is assumed to\ncontain unary predicates only.\n\n\nWe can define the concept  \n\n\\[(\\mm,\\G)\\models_s\\phi\n\\]\n\n\nfor second-order \\(\\phi\\) by induction on \\(\\phi\\) by stipulating \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n(\\mm,\\G)\\models_s\\exists X\\,\\phi & \\iff (\\mm,\\G)\\models_{s(P/X)} \\phi\\text{ for some  $P\\in \\G$}.\\\\\n(\\mm,\\G)\\models_s\\exists F\\,\\phi &\\iff (\\mm,\\G)\\models_{s(f/X)} \\phi\\text{ for some  $f\\in \\G$}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nThe difference to the original truth definition of second-order logic\nis thus that the interpretations of the second-order variables cannot\nbe quite arbitrary, they have to be found in \\(\\G\\). The smaller the\n\\(\\G\\) is, the weaker the logic. On the other hand, if \\(\\G^\\star\\) is\nthe set of all relations and functions on M, then the\ntruth definition for the general model \\((\\mm,\\G^\\star)\\) is the same\nas the original truth definition. We call such general models\nfull and indeed identify \\((\\mm,\\G^\\star)\\) with \\(\\mm\\). The\nother extreme is that \\(\\G=\\emptyset\\). Then we are back in first\norder logic. To distinguish second-order logic with general models\nfrom the original second-order logic, we call the latter\nfull.\n\n\nDefinition 13 A general model which satisfies all the\naxioms of second-order logic, including the Comprehension Axiom Schema\nand the Axioms of Choice, is called a Henkin model.\n\n\nNote that there is no sentence of second-order logic which\nsays that the model is full. That is, there is no\nsecond-order \\(\\phi\\) such that for all general models \\((\\mm,\\G)\\) it\nholds that  \n\n\\[\n(\\mm,\\G)\\models\\phi\\iff (\\mm,\\G) \\text{ is full.}\n\\]\n\n\nIf we attempt to use \\(\\forall X\\,\\exists Y\\,\\forall\nx(X(x)\\leftrightarrow Y(x))\\) as such a \\(\\phi\\), we just obtain the\nresult that \\(\\phi\\) is always true and says that the general model\n\\((\\mm,\\G)\\) is \u201cfull\u201d in its own sense of\n\u201cfull\u201d, not in the sense of the metatheory.\n\nA natural attempt to get a Henkin model \\((\\mm,\\G)\\) would be to let\n\\(\\G\\) consist of first order definable relations and\nfunctions on \\(\\mm\\). However, in this way we get only Arithmetic\nComprehension, not the full Comprehension Axiom.\n\nAn easy way to obtain a Henkin model \\((\\mm,\\G)\\) is to take a\ntransitive model N of ZFC such that \\(\\mm\\in N\\) and let \\(\\G\\)\nconsist of all relations and functions on M that are elements\nof N. It follows from \\(N\\models ZFC\\) that \\((\\mm,\\G)\\) is a\nHenkin model.\n\nTruth in a general model, namely the proposition\n\u201c\\((\\mm,\\G)\\models_s\\phi\\)\u201d is absolute relative to ZFC,\ncontrary to the truth definition of (full) second-order logic. In this\nrespect second-order logic with general models resembles first order\nlogic. As we will see, it resembles first order logic in many other\nrespects, too.\n\nSecond-order logic with general models can be thought of in terms of\nmany sorted logic. Many sorted logic is first order logic\nwith several different sorts of variables. Respectively,\nrelations and functions may be between elements of different sorts.\nHere \u201csort\u201d just means that variables of different\n\u201csorts\u201d are kept apart by giving them different names.\nOtherwise the variables are just ordinary first order variables.\nStructures \\(\\mm\\) of many-sorted logic have a separate domain \\(M_s\\)\nfor each sort s. We may think of second-order logic as many\nsorted logic in which the individual variables are of a sort \\(\\si\\),\nfor each n the n-ary relation variables are of a sort\n\\(\\sr\\), and the n-ary function variables of a sort \\(s_n^{\\rm\nfu}\\). In addition there is an \\(n+1\\)-ary relation symbol \\(\\sA\\)\nbetween n-tuples of individuals and n-ary relation\nvariables indicating which n-tuples are in a relation and which\nare not. Finally there is an \\(n+1\\)-ary function symbol \\(\\sF\\)\nbetween n-tuples of individual, individuals, and n-ary\nfunction variables indicating what value a function variable gives to\neach n-tuple. There are obvious first order axioms which\nguarantee that the many sorted logic just described faithfully mirrors\nsecond-order logic with general models.\n [12]\n\nFor more on the reduction of second-order logic to many-sorted logic,\nwe refer to Manzano (1996). For example, the proof theory of\nsecond-order logic can be understood via the translation to many\nsorted logic. For more on the proof theory of second-order logic, see\nBuss (1998). There is a translation of many sorted logic further to\nsingle sorted first order logic due essentially to Herbrand (1930),\nsee also Wang (1952) and Schmidt (1951). This can be used to obtain\nmany of the basic properties of first order logic first for many\nsorted logic and then further for second-order logic with general\nmodels.\n\nThe most important application of general models is the Completeness\nTheorem:\n\n\nTheorem 14 (Henkin 1950) A second-order sentence\nfollows from the axioms if and only if it is true in all Henkin\nmodels.\n [13]\n\n\nRespectively, we obtain the Compactness\n Theorem[14]\n as well as the downward and the upward versions of the\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\n Theorem.[15]\n\nOne way to think about Henkin models is that they fill the gaps left\nby full models, just as irrational numbers fill the gaps left by\nrational numbers. They are needed in order to obtain a smooth theory\nof second-order logic. They manifest \u201cparadoxical\u201d\nphenomena that we do not see among full models. For example we obtain\nnon-standard models of number theory, countable models of the axioms\nof real numbers, etc. The categorical sentences characterizing\nmathematical structures among full models now suddenly have also other\n\u201cmodels\u201d, namely Henkin models, and they come in all\ninfinite cardinalities.\n\nIf \\(\\phi\\) is a second-order sentence we define  \n\n\\[\\tag{11}\\label{henkin}\n\\textit{Mod}_H(\\phi)=\\{(\\mm,\\G) : (\\mm,\\G)\\models\\phi\\} \n\\]\n\n\nObviously, \\(\\Mod(\\phi)\\subseteq \\textit{Mod}_H(\\phi)\\). If \\(\\phi\\)\ncharacterizes \\(\\mm\\) up to isomorphism, then \\(\\mm\\in \\Mod(\\phi) \\).\nIn all non-trivial\n cases[16]\n \\(\\textit{Mod}_H(\\phi)\\ne \\{\\mm\\}\\). We can think of\n\\(\\textit{Mod}_H(\\phi)\\) as a class of \u201capproximations\u201d of\n\\(\\mm\\). One of the approximations is the \u201creal\u201d \\(\\mm\\)\nbut by means of deductions in second-order logic we cannot tell which.\nBecause of the inherent weakness of formal systems, going back to\nSkolem and G\u00f6del, infinite structures are shrouded by Henkin\nmodels and cannot be gotten perfectly into focus by deductive\nmeans.\n\nThe Fraenkel-Mostowski method is a construction of Henkin\nmodels which was first used in set theory to obtain models where Axiom\nof Choice fails, and later used in second-order logic to obtain\nsimilar models before the method of forcing emerged. The method goes\nas follows: Suppose \\(\\ma\\) is a structure and H is a group of\npermutations on A. A subset B of \\(A^n\\) is called\nsymmetric if there is a finite set \\(E\\subseteq A\\), called a\nsupport of B, such that for all \\(\\pi\\in H\\) which fix\nE\n pointwise[17],\n  \n\n\\[\\forall x_1\\ldots\\forall x_n((x_1,\\ldots, x_n)\\in B\\to (\\pi(x_1),\\ldots, \\pi(x_n))\\in B).\n\\]\n\n\nThe respective condition for a function \\(f:A^n\\to A\\) is \n\n\\[\n\\forall x_1\\ldots\\forall x_n ((x_1,\\ldots ,x_n) \\in B\n\\to  f(\\pi(x_1), \\ldots ,\\pi(x_n)) \\in B  \\land {}\\\\\nf(\\pi(x_1),\\ldots ,\\pi(x_n)) = \\pi (f (x_1,\\ldots ,x_n\n)))\n\\]\n\n\nLet \\(\\G\\) be the set of symmetric relations and functions on\nA. The pair \\((\\ma,\\G)\\) is always a Henkin model.\n\nAmong the early applications of the Fraenkel-Mostowski method were the\nresult of Mostowski (1938) that one cannot prove from the\nComprehension Axiom Schema alone the equivalence of two different\ndefinitions of finiteness and of Lindenbaum and Mostowski (1938) that\nZermelo's axioms for set theory are not enough to prove the Axiom of\nChoice, or even just that every infinite set is the disjoint union of\ntwo infinite sets.\n\nThe Fraenkel model arises if H is the group of all\npermutations of an infinite set A. In the Fraenkel model the\nset A is infinite but Dedekind-finite (i.e., A has no\none-one function into a proper subset) and cannot be well-ordered, not\neven linearly ordered. Moreover, the set A is not the disjoint\nunion of two infinite sets. There is no choice function for two\nelement subsets of A.\n\nThe Mostowski model arises if \\(A=\\oQ\\) and H is the\ngroup of automorphisms of \\((\\oQ,<)\\). In the Mostowski model the\nset A can be linearly ordered but not well-ordered. The Axiom\nof Choice holds for (sets of) non-empty finite sets.\n\nFor more on Fraenkel-Mostowski models as Henkin models for\nsecond-order logic, see Ga\u00dfner (1994).\n\n9.2 Axioms of infinity\n \nRecall our convention: Whenever we use upper case Fraktur letters,\nsuch as \\(\\ma,\\mb,\\mm,\\mn\\) etc, to name a structure, we use the upper\ncase Italic versions of those letters, such as \\(A,B,M,N\\) etc, to\nname the domain of the structure.\n\nThe axioms of second-order logic are trivially true in a (full) model\nwith just one element. This raises the question how to guarantee that\nthere are more than one element in the domain. Of course, we can add,\nfor every n, an axiom which says that there are more than\nn elements. There are various ways to say in second-order logic\nwith one axiom that there are infinitely many\nindividuals. These are equivalent in full models but may be\nnon-equivalent in Henkin models. Some are equivalent if the Axiom of\nChoice is assumed. Let us call a second-order sentence \\(\\phi\\) of the\nempty vocabulary an Axiom of Infinity if  \n\n\\[\\ma\\models\\phi\\text{ if and only if $A$ is infinite}.\n\\]\n\n\nAn axiom of infinity can say in second-order logic that a proper\nsubset of the domain has the same cardinality as the entire domain\n(i.e., that the domain is not Dedekind-finite), or that there is a\npartial order without a maximal element, or that there is a set with a\nunary function and a constant which constitute a structure isomorphic\nto \\((\\oN,s,0)\\), or that the domain is the union of two disjoint sets\nwhich have the same cardinality as the domain, and so on. As is the\ncase in set theory without the Axiom of Choice, the different\nformulations of infiniteness need not be equivalent. In second-order\nlogic the situation is even more diffuse because of the variety of\ndifferent formulations of the Axiom of Choice. We refer to Asser\n(1981) for a discussion of the different variants and to Hasenjaeger\n(1961) for a proof that the various non-equivalent forms of Axioms of\nInfinity form in a sense a dense set. For a survey of different\nconcepts of finiteness, see de la Cruz (2002).\n\n\n10. Categoricity\n\nA theory in second (or first) order logic is said to be\ncategorical if any two of its models are isomorphic. A single\nsentence (which has a model) is categorical if and only if it\ncharacterizes some model up to isomorphism (see\n \u00a77.1).\n A nice property of a categorical theory \\(\\Gamma\\) is (semantic)\ncompleteness: Any sentence \\(\\phi\\) in the language in which\nthe theory is written is decided by \\(\\Gamma\\) in the following sense.\nEither every model of \\(\\Gamma\\) satisfies \\(\\phi\\) or every model of\n\\(\\Gamma\\) satisfies \\(\\neg\\phi\\). In other words, either \\(\\phi\\) or\n\\(\\neg\\phi\\) is a (semantic) logical consequence of \\(\\Gamma\\). The\nreason is very simple: \\(\\Gamma\\) has, up to isomorphism, only one\nmodel M. Since isomorphism preserves truth in second-order\nlogic, \\(\\phi\\) or \\(\\neg\\phi\\) is a (semantic) logical consequence of\n\\(\\Gamma\\) according to whether \\(\\phi\\) is true in M or false\nin M.\n\nIf \\(\\phi\\) is a second-order sentence we defined above \\(\\Mod(\\phi)\\)\nas the class \\(\\{\\mm : \\mm\\models\\phi\\}\\). If \\(\\phi\\) characterizes\n\\(\\mm\\) up to isomorphism, then, up to isomorphism,  \n\n\\[\\Mod(\\phi)=\\{\\mm\\}.\n\\]\n\n\nThe project of axiomatizing mathematical structures with second-order\nsentences was so successful in the first quarter of the twentieth\ncentury that Carnap even proposed that every mathematical\nstructure is determined, up to isomorphism, by its second-order\ntheory. There are trivial cardinality reasons why this could not\npossibly hold for all models of size \\(2^\\omega\\) and larger. There\nare simply not enough second-order theories in comparison with the\nnumber of non-isomorphic models. However, the proposal of Carnap is\ntrivially true for finite models, and not entirely unreasonable for\ncountable models. In fact Ajtai (1979) showed that it is consistent\nwith ZFC, provided ZFC itself is consistent, that any two countable\nstructures in a finite vocabulary that satisfy the same second-order\nsentences are isomorphic. Ajtai showed that it is also consistent with\nZFC, provided ZFC itself is consistent, that there are two countable\nstructures in a finite vocabulary that satisfy the same second-order\nsentences without being isomorphic. Thus Carnap\u2019s conjecture\n(for countable models) is independent of ZFC.\n\nSolovay has made a posting in FOM (2006\n Other Internet Resources)\n in which he shows that the related statement that every complete\nsecond-order sentence \\(\\theta\\) is categorical, is independent\nof ZFC.\n\nThere is a strong form of categoricity which holds for Henkin\nstructures in important cases and agrees with the usual concept of\ncategoricity in the case of full Henkin models. It builds on the\nremarkable ability of second-order logic to express its own\ncategoricity. The isomorphism \\((M,R)\\cong(M',R')\\) of two structures\n\\((M,R)\\) and \\((M',R')\\), where the predicates R and \\(R'\\)\nare, say, binary, can be expressed in second-order logic as follows,\nletting \\(\\ma=(A,M,M',R,R')\\), where A is any set containing\n\\(M\\cup M'\\), \\(M=U^\\ma\\), \\(M'={U'}^\\ma\\), \\(R=P^\\ma\\) and\n\\(R'=P'^\\ma\\). Now  \n\n\\[(M,R)\\cong(M',R')\\iff\\ma\\models\\isom(U,P,U',P'),\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\isom(U,P,U',P')\\) is the sentence  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\exists F[\n\\forall x(U(x)\\to U'(F(x))) \\land {}\\\\\n&\\quad  \\forall x\\,\\exists y\n(\nU'(x)\\to \n(\nU(y)\\land \nx=F(y)\n)\n) \n \\land {}\\\\\n&\\quad\\forall x\\,\\forall y(\n(\nU(x) \\land U(y)) \\to {}\\\\\n&\\quad[\n(F(x)=F(y)\\to x=y)   \\land {}\\\\\n&\\quad(P(x,y)\\leftrightarrow P'(F(x),F(y)))\n]\n)\n].\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nThis suggests that the categoricity of a sentence \\(\\theta(P)\\) with a\nbinary predicate symbol P can be redefined\n equivalently,[18]\n letting \\(\\categ(\\theta(P))\\) be the sentence  \n\n\\[\\forall P\\,\\forall P'\\,\\forall U\\,\\forall U'\\left(\\left(\\theta(P)^{U}\\land\\theta(P')^{U'}\\right)\\to\\isom(U,P,U',P')\\right),\n\\]\n\n\nas  \n\n\\[\\tag{12}\\label{redef}\n\\models\\categ(\\theta(P)).\n\\]\n\n\nIn fact, this is how Tarski defines categoricity in 1956 (page 387).\nThis leads us to define:\n\n\nDefinition 15 We say that \\(\\theta(P)\\) is\ninternally categorical if  \n\n\\[\\tag{13}\\label{internal}\n\\vdash\\categ(\\theta(P)).\n\\]\n\n\n\nInternal categoricity could also be called provable\ncategoricity. The phrase \u2018internal categoricity\u2019 was\nintroduced in the context of arithmetic in Walmsley (2002). It was\nadvocated more generally in V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen (2012), with more\ndetails in V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen and Wang (2015). We refer to Button\nand Walsh (2016) for a recent discussion on this concept.\n\nNote that (\\ref{internal}) is stronger than (\\ref{redef}) because\nprovable sentences are certainly valid. Owing to the Completeness\nTheorem we can rewrite (\\ref{internal}) as  \n\n\\[\\tag{14}\\label{internals}\n(\\ma,\\G)\\models\\categ(\\theta(P))\\text{ for all Henkin models $(\\ma,\\G)$}.\n\\]\n\n\nThus internal categoricity means categoricity not only for ordinary\nmodels, i.e., full Henkin models, but categoricity inside an arbitrary\nHenkin model. Note that categoricity is a meta-theoretical concept as\nit refers to the semantics of second-order logic. In\n\\(\\categ(\\theta(P))\\) the categoricity of \\(\\theta(P)\\) is written in\nthe language of second-order logic. That is, the categoricity, despite\nbeing a meta-theoretical concept, is written in the object language.\nIt can be asked, whether this leads us to a different concept? Be that\nas it may, when the meaning of \\(\\categ(\\theta(P))\\) is uncovered by\nconsidering its semantics in the meta-theory, the meaning is the same\nas the meaning we give to the categoricity of \\(\\theta(P)\\). In the\nconcept of internal categoricity we take advantage of this situation\nby switching from semantical meaning to proof-theoretic meaning. We\ninsist that \\(\\categ(\\theta(P))\\) is (not only valid but even)\nprovable. Proof-theory requires less meta-theory than semantics. We\ncan investigate provability of second-order sentences even in number\ntheory by using numbers to code sentences and proofs, as G\u00f6del\ndid in his proof of the Incompleteness Theorem. Of course, the\nCompleteness Theorem brings us back to the semantics.\n\nTo verify the categoricity of a second-order sentence one has to go\nthrough infinite structures in a way which essentially calls for set\ntheory. The situation with internal categoricity is different. To\nverify the internal categoricity of a second-order sentence one just\nhas to produce a proof. So there is a dramatic difference. And still\ninternal categoricity is stronger than categoricity. So it would be\nfoolish to establish categoricity if one could establish even internal\ncategoricity. Fortunately, the classical examples of categorical\nsentences are all internally categorical:\n\n\nTheorem 16 (V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen & Wang 2015)\nThe received second-order sentences characterizing the structures\n\\((\\oN,<)\\) and \\((\\oR,<,+,\\cdot,0,1)\\) are internally\ncategorical.\n\n\nThe concept of internal categoricity provides a bridge between full\nsemantics and Henkin semantics. It works in the same way in both cases\nand shows that the full semantics is a limit case of Henkin semantics\nbut does not have a monopoly when it comes to categoricity.\n\n11. Logics Between First and Second Order\n\nFirst order logic and second-order logic are in a sense two opposite\nextremes. There are many logics between them i.e., logics that extend\nproperly first order logic, and are properly contained in second-order\nlogic. One example is the extension of first order logic by the\ngeneralized quantifier known as the Henkin quantifier:\n\n\\[\\left( \\begin{array}{cc}\n\\forall x&\\exists y\\\\\n\\forall u&\\exists v\n\\end{array}\\right)\\phi(x,y,u,v,z_1,\\ldots,z_n)\n\\]\n\n\nwhich has the meaning  \n\n\\[\\exists f\\,\\exists g\\,\\forall x\\,\\forall u\\,\\phi(x,f(x),u,g(u),z_1,\\ldots,z_n).\n\\]\n\n\nThe extension \\(L(H)\\) of first order logic by the Henkin quantifier\nis almost the same as second-order logic: they have the same\n\\(\\Delta\\)-extension (Krynicki & Lachlan\n 1979).[19]\n\nThe equicardinality or H\u00e4rtig quantifier  \n\n\\[Ixy\\,\\phi(x,z_1,\\ldots,z_n)\\psi(x,z_1,\\ldots,z_n)\n\\]\n\n\nhas the meaning \u201cthere are as many elements x satisfying\n\\(\\phi(x,z_1,\\ldots,z_n)\\) as there are elements y satisfying\n\\(\\psi(y,z_1,\\ldots,z_n)\\)\u201d, i.e., \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\exists f\\,\\forall x[\n(\\phi(x,z_1,\\ldots,z_n)\\leftrightarrow\\psi(f(x),z_1,\\ldots,z_n))\n\\land {}\\\\\n&\\quad\\forall x\\,\\forall y(f(x)=f(y)\\to x=y)\n\\land {}\\\\\n&\\quad\\forall y\\,\\exists x(\\psi(y,z_1,\\ldots,z_n)\\to f(x)=y)\n]\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nThe extension \\(L(I)\\) of first order logic by the H\u00e4rtig\nquantifier is\n weaker[20]\n than second-order logic as its L\u00f6wenheim number can be\n\\(<2^\\omega\\), but if \\(V=L\\), then it is \\(\\Delta\\)-equivalent\nwith second-order logic (V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 1980).\n\nHere are some other generalized quantifiers that are clearly\nsecond-order definable: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nQ_0x\\,\\phi(x,z_1,\\ldots,z_n)& \\iff\\exists X(\n|X|\\ge\\aleph_0\n\\land \\forall x\\in X\\phi(x,z_1,\\ldots,z_n)\n)\\\\\nQ_1x\\,\\phi(x,z_1,\\ldots,z_n)&\\iff\\exists X(\n |X|\\ge\\aleph_1\n\\land{} \\forall x\\in X\\phi(x,z_1,\\ldots,z_n)\n)\\\\\nQ^{MM}_1xy\\,\\phi(x,y,z_1,\\ldots,z_n)&\\iff\\exists X(\n|X|\\ge\\aleph_1\n\\land{} \\forall x,y\\in X\\phi(x,y,z_1,\\ldots,z_n)\n)\\\\\nQ^{cof}_\\omega xy\\,\\phi(x,y,z_1,\\ldots,z_n)&\\iff \\{(x,y):\\phi(x,y,z_1,\\ldots,z_n)\\}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\nis a linear order of cofinality \\(\\omega\\)\n\n\nIn weak second-order logic we have no function variables and\nthe relation variables range over finite relations only. The resulting\nlogic is in many ways similar to the extension of first order logic by\nthe generalized quantifier \\(Q_0\\). Another way to limit the power of\nsecond-order logic is the following: Suppose \\(\\psi\\) is a first order\nformula with an n-ary relation variable X and no\nnon-logical symbols. For infinite A, we define \\(\\ma\\models_s\nQ_{\\psi}X\\phi\\) if and only if there is a relation \\(P\\subseteq M^n\\)\nsuch that \\(\\ma\\models_{s(P/X)}\\phi\\land\\psi\\). The quantifier\n\\(Q_{\\psi}\\) allows second-order quantification over relations that\nsatisfies \\(\\psi\\). If \\(\\psi\\) is \\(\\forall x(x=x)\\) we obtain the\nusual second-order quantifier which we denote \\(Q_{II}\\). If moreover\n\\( n=1\\) we obtain the monadic second-order quantifier which we denote\n\\(Q_{mon}\\). If \\(n=1\\) and \\(\\psi\\) says that X is a\nsingleton, we obtain the usual first order quantifier which we now\ndenote \\(Q_I\\). Finally, if \\(\\psi\\) says X is the graph of a\npermutation of the model, we denote this quantifier by \\(Q_{1-1}\\).\nRather surprisingly, it turns out that with the right concept of\ninterpretability the quantifiers \\(Q_I,Q_{mon},Q_{1-1}\\) and\n\\(Q_{II}\\) are, up to biinterpretability, the only\nsecond-order quantifiers of the form \\(Q_{\\psi}\\) (Shelah 1973).\n\n12. Higher Order Logic vis-\u00e0-vis Type Theory\n\nThere are many ways to further extend second-order logic. The most\nobvious is third, fourth, and so on order logic. The general\nprinciple, already recognized by Tarski (1933 [1956]), is that in\nhigher order logic one can formalize the semantics\u2014define\ntruth\u2014of lower order logic. Therefore one certainly gains\nexpressive power by using higher order logic. Let us take number\ntheory as an example. With first order logic we can express properties\nsuch as \u201cn is a prime number\u201d and propositions such\nas \u201cthere are infinitely many prime numbers\u201d,\nFermat\u2019s Last Theorem and Goldbach\u2019s Conjecture. First\norder properties of natural numbers fall into a natural hierarchy\ncalled the arithmetical hierarchy the levels of which are\ndenoted \\(\\Sigma^0_n\\) and \\(\\Pi^0_n\\). With second-order logic we can\ntalk about properties of sets of natural numbers, or in other words,\nproperties of real numbers. In particular, we can define the\nrationals. A continuous function on the real numbers is determined by\nits values on rationals. Also, an open set is determined by which\nrational points it contains. Using these observations we can talk\nabout continuous functions and open sets of reals. Basic facts in\ncalculus, such as Bolzano\u2019s Theorem stating that \u201cIf a\ncontinuous function has values of opposite sign inside an interval,\nthen it has a root in that interval\u201d are expressible in\nsecond-order logic over the structure \\((\\oN,+,\\cdot)\\) of natural\nnumbers. Second-order properties of natural numbers fall into a\nnatural hierarchy called the analytical hierarchy and its\nlevels are denoted \\(\\Sigma^1_n\\) and \\(\\Pi^1_n\\). With third order\nlogic we can talk about sets of real numbers. We can write\nthe Continuum Hypothesis in third order logic and ask the hard\nquestion, whether the model \\((\\oN,+,\\cdot)\\) satisfies this sentence.\nThird order properties of natural numbers have again a natural\nhierarchy and its levels are denoted \\(\\Sigma^2_n\\) and\n\\(\\Pi^2_n\\).\n\nIt is obvious that if we keep a base model, such as \\((\\oN,+,\\cdot)\\)\nfixed, and move to higher and higher order logic, we can express more\nand more complicated concepts and propositions. However,\nthird order logic over  \n\n\\[\\mn_1=(\\oN,+,\\cdot)\n\\]\n\n\nis nothing more than second order logic over \n\n\\[\\mn_2=(\\P(\\oN),E,\\oN,+,\\cdot),\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(E\\subseteq \\oN\\times\\P(\\oN)\\) is the relation \\(nEr\\iff n\\in\nr\\), which again is nothing more than first order logic over\n \n\n\\[\\mn_3=(\\P(\\P(\\oN))),E',\\P(\\oN),E,\\oN,+,\\cdot),\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(E'\\subseteq \\P(\\oN)\\times\\P(\\P(\\oN)\\) is the relation\n\\(rE'X\\iff r\\in X\\). Moreover, second-order logic over \\(\\mn_1\\) is\nnothing more than first order logic over \\(\\mn_2\\). When this line of\nthought is taken to its limit we can see that first order logic over\nthe cumulative hierarchy of sets covers higher order logic over any\nindividual level \\(V_\\alpha\\) of the hierarchy. In a sense, first\norder logic over the cumulative hierarchy of sets is a very very high\norder logic over \\(\\mn_1\\).\n\nThere is a marked similarity in the way \\(\\mn_2\\) arises from\n\\(\\mn_1\\) and in the way \\(\\mn_3\\) arises from \\(\\mn_2\\). In both\ncases we simply add a power set construction on top of what the model\nalready has. Second-order logic alone is very good with power sets as\nwe saw in\n \u00a75.3.\n A consequence of this is that all the higher order logics (of any\nfinite order and up to a point also of infinite order) from\nsecond-order on have Turing-equivalent decision problems and the same\nHanf- and L\u00f6wenheim numbers (see\n \u00a74).\n Thus, even though higher than second-order logics are strictly\nspeaking stronger than second-order logic no difference can be seen by\nthe usual criteria of strength of expressive power.\n\nType theory is a systematic approach to higher order logics.\nVariables are assigned types just as in second-order logic we have\nvariables for individual type, relation type and function type. In a\nhigher order logic it would make sense to have variables for relations\nbetween objects of any lower types as well as functions mapping\nobjects of lower type to objects of lower type. In set theory objects\nhave a rank. Elements of a set have a lower rank than the set itself.\nHowever, the difference between set-theoretical rank and typing in\ntype theory is that in set theory the rank can be computed when the\nset is known while in type theory the type of an object can be seen\nfrom the type of the variable that the object is the value of. In a\nsense type theory imposes from the syntax a type for each object\nconsidered while in set theory a set has a rank given by the\nsemantics. Arguably set theory gained dominance over type theory after\nthe 1930s because of its simpler syntax and semantics. On the other\nhand type theory is used in computer science, especially in the theory\nof programming languages (see SEP entry on\n type theory).\n\n13. Foundations of Mathematics\n\nMathematics can be based on set theory. This means that mathematical\nobjects are construed as sets and their properties are derived from\nthe axioms of set theory. The intuitive informal picture behind set\ntheory is that there is a cumulative hierarchy \\(V_\\alpha\\)\n(\\(\\alpha\\) an ordinal) of sets and the axioms are intended to\ndescribe the basic properties of such sets. This kind of set\ntheoretical foundation of mathematics has become widely accepted among\nworking mathematicians. We refer to the SEP entry on\n set theory\n for more details. Alternatives to set theory are at least\n category theory,\n constructive mathematics, and second-order logic.\n\nIf one tries to follow as a logician the language mathematicians use\nin their research, one cannot help seeing that they use second-order\nconcepts very freely. For example, the Induction Axiom is without\ndoubt used by mathematicians in the second-order form depicted in\n(\\ref{ind}). In their natural language mathematicians do not hesitate\nto use higher order concepts, and indeed do not always even (need to)\nknow the difference.\n\nSecond-order logic as a foundation for mathematics focuses on\nmathematical structures rather than mathematical\n\u201cobjects\u201d, as set theory does. In principle every\nstructure has its own \u201cfoundation\u201d based on the special\nfeatures of the structure. The role of second-order logic is to\nprovide a common framework for this. The intuitive informal picture\nbehind second-order logic on a structure is that there is a domain\nA of individuals and then separate domains for all n-ary\nrelations for all \\(n\\in\\oN\\) and for all n-ary functions for\nall \\(n\\in\\oN\\), associated with A. In comparison to the\ninformal picture of set theory, we have only the domains of subsets,\nrelations and functions, not iterations such as sets of sets, sets of\nsets of sets and so on, as in set theory. Therefore the intuitive\npicture behind second-order logic is simpler than the picture behind\nset theory. In particular, there is no transfinite iteration over all\nordinals. Most structures \\(\\ma\\) used in mathematics have a\nsecond-order characterization \\(\\theta_\\ma\\), see\n \u00a710.\n Proving (second order) properties \\(\\phi\\) of such structures means\nderiving \\(\\phi\\) from \\(\\theta_\\ma\\). Opinions differ as to whether\nthis derivation should be a syntactic (formal) derivation using some\n(incomplete) axiom system of second-order logic or whether it should\nbe a semantic derivation (of the form \u201cEvery model of the\nassumptions is a model of the conclusion\u201d). For a working\nmathematician there is not much difference and probably a semantic\nderivation is usually favored.\n\nSuppose a mathematician wants to convince someone about the truth of\nBolzano\u2019s Theorem \u201cIf a continuous function on the reals\nhas negative values as well as positive values inside an interval,\nthen it has a root in that interval\u201d. They would start with the\nordered field of real numbers. It would be (thought to be) clear what\nthis means because the second-order axiomatization of the field is\ncategorical. Then they would take an arbitrary continuous function\nf on this field such that it has values of opposite sign inside\na fixed interval \\((a,b)\\). It would be clear what this means because\nsecond-order logic has variables for functions. Let \\(c,d\\in (a,b)\\)\nsuch that \\(f(c)<0\\) and \\(f(d)>0\\). Without loss of generality,\n\\(c<d\\). Let \\(X=\\{e\\in(a,b) : f(e)<0\\}\\). Since we have\nrelation variables for subsets of the domain, we can think of X\nsimply as a value of such a relation variable. It is obvious that\nX exists, but a priori we could have imposed contradictory\nconditions on X (e.g., \\(X=\\{e : e\\notin X\\}\\)) and then we\nshould not be able to claim that it exists. However, in this case the\nComprehension Axiom Schema implies that X exists. Clearly,\n\\(X\\ne\\emptyset\\) and X is bounded from above by d. One\nof the second-order axioms characterizing the field of real numbers is\nthat every non-empty set which is bounded from above has a supremum.\nThus we can let z to be the supremum of X. Now it\nfollows from basic properties of continuous functions that\n\\(f(z)=0\\).\n\nIt would be difficult to tell in the above proof whether it was a\nsyntactical derivation from the axioms or a semantic argument. On the\nsurface it looks like a semantic argument. But every step can be\nderived from the axioms, so it could be considered a shorthand version\nof a syntactic derivation.\n\nSyntactic derivations in second-order logic based on the Comprehension\nAxiom Schema and Axioms of Choice are very much like syntactic\nderivations in set theory. In neither case would a working\nmathematicians write all the details of the argument but would resort\nto shorthand notation. In both cases\u2014second-order logic and set\ntheory\u2014we can interpret the proofs as shorthand versions of\nsyntactic formal proofs or as semantic proofs. First order logic\nsatisfies the Completeness Theorem with the help of which semantic\nproofs can be turned into syntactic formal proofs. Since the\nCompleteness Theorem uses the concept of a first order structure,\nsentences proved from the axioms are true in all models of the axioms,\nboth countable models and non-standard models. Are they true in the\nintuitive model of cumulative hierarchy of sets? By the Reflection\nTheorem such sentences are true in the class of all sets, but since\nthe intuitive model is informal, we cannot prove that the\nclass of all sets is the same as the intuitive model.\n\nOn the other hand, in order for the Completeness Theorem to be\napplicable, a semantic argument has to be such that it works whatever\nmodel of set theory we are using. This means that a semantic argument\nin set theory should not use properties of individual models of set\ntheory unless they are universal first order properties of all models\nof ZFC. In practice this means that if a property such as \\(CH\\),\n\\(\\Diamond\\), \\(2^{\\aleph_0}=\\aleph_2\\), and so on, is used, it is\nmentioned separately as an assumption. Non-first order properties of\nmodels cannot be used at all, or else the Completeness Theorem cannot\nbe used. Still, sometimes non-first order properties are\nused. For example, we may have an argument that every\ncountable model of ZFC satisfies \\(\\phi\\). But then, by the\nDownward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem Theorem, every model of ZFC\nsatisfies \\(\\phi\\). Thus we have been able to eliminate the non-first\norder assumption of the countability of the model.\n\nSecond-order logic satisfies the Completeness Theorem if Henkin models\nare used. Thus semantic arguments in second-order logic can be turned\ninto syntactic formal proofs, but as with set theory the semantic\nargument has to be valid in all Henkin models, not only in\nall of the full Henkin models. Thus, as in set theory, the\nsemantic argument cannot use properties of the Henkin models that are\nnot shared by all Henkin models, In particular, fullness (see\n \u00a79.1)\n cannot be assumed because in general models it is not a second-order\nproperty. What happens to categoricity when fullness is abandoned? We\nstill have internal categoricity, so we can use categoricity in proofs\nas long as we make sure we work inside one model. One certain way to\nmake sure of this is that we base everything on the axioms, the\nComprehension Axiom Schema and the Axioms of Choice.\n\nWhen second-order logic is used as a foundation for mathematics, a\nsituation may emerge in which third order logic is needed. For\nexample, a topology is usually defined as a family of sets\nand is therefore a third order object. It would be well in the spirit\nof second-order logic to simply include third (or higher) order logic\nwhen needed. Naturally, the Comprehension Axiom Schema and the Axioms\nof Choice have to be then assumed for third order quantifiers.\n\nWe have devoted a fair amount of space in this entry to the power of\nsecond-order logic to characterize structures (see\n \u00a77.1).\n Putting it briefly, if a structure has mathematical interest, it is\nsecond-order characterizable. Structures constructed by means of the\nAxiom of Choice may escape being second-order characterizable. But\nwhat is the power of second-order logic to demonstrate the\nexistence of structures? The axioms, including the\nComprehension Axioms and the Axioms of Choice, can be satisfied in a\none element domain. So we cannot prove from the axioms that\nthere are any structures of any size \\(>1\\). This undermines\nQuine\u2019s characterization of second-order logic as \u201cset\ntheory in sheep\u2019s clothing\u201d (1970, section heading in\nchapter 5), meant probably to suggest that the ontological commitments\nof second-order logic are on the same level as those of set\ntheory.\n\nPerhaps the philosophy of second-order logic is that if a structure\ncan be characterized, it exists, echoing Hilbert\u2019s formalist\nphilosophy. However, even in that sense we need to know that the\ncharacterizing sentence \\(\\theta_\\ma\\) is consistent. A trivial\napproach is to observe that \\(\\ma\\) itself certainly satisfies\n\\(\\theta_\\ma\\), but this clearly begs the question. Still, this is how\nHilbert argues for the consistency of his axioms for the real numbers\n(1900). If \\(\\ma=(\\oN,+,\\cdot)\\), an Axiom of Infinity saying that\nthat a proper subset of the domain has the same cardinality as the\nentire domain, is what is needed. In combination with the\nComprehension Axiom Schema the existence of \\(\\ma\\) follows. For\n\\((\\oR,+,\\cdot,0,1)\\) this is not enough, we need a stronger Axiom of\nInfinity, for example the existence of a dense order which satisfies\nthe Completeness Axiom: Every bounded non-empty set has a supremum. It\nseems inevitable that when we move from a structure to a bigger\nstructure we need to make a largeness assumption. Such assumptions are\ncalled Large Domain Assumptions in V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen (2012). In\nset theory this aspect is taken care of at the outset by assuming the\nPower Set Axiom and the Replacement Axioms which together make sure\nthat there are large enough sets. In second-order logic we have to\nassume new and new Large Domain Assumptions, as we move along. This\ncan be seen as a drawback, having to make new assumptions all the\ntime. On the other hand it can be seen as an asset, not having to make\ntoo ambitious assumptions before they are really needed.\n\n14. Second-Order Arithmetic\n\nOwing to the central role that real numbers play in mathematics, the\nsecond-order theory of natural numbers, known as second-order\narithmetic (Simpson 1999 [2009]), and denoted \\(Z_2\\), is an\nimportant foundational theory. It is stronger than (first order) Peano\narithmetic but weaker than set theory. It has variables for\nindividuals thought of as natural numbers as well as variables for\nsets of natural numbers thought of as real numbers. In addition there\nare \\(+\\) and \\(\\times\\) for arithmetic operations on the individuals.\nAs axioms \\(Z_2\\) has some rather obvious axioms about \\(+\\) and\n\\(\\times\\), the Induction Axiom (\\ref{ind}), and the axioms of\nsecond-order logic, including the Comprehension Principles (\\ref{CA}).\nA surprising amount of mathematics can be derived in \\(Z_2\\). We refer\nto Simpson (1999 [2009]) for details. In a sense, \\(Z_2\\) is a great\nsuccess story for second-order logic.\n\nReverse mathematics uses \\(Z_2\\) to isolate the exact axioms\non which well-known theorems from mathematics rely. In a textbook such\ntheorems are proved perhaps in an informal set theory, but how much\nset theory is actually needed in each case? For example, we may ask\nwhat is the weakest set of axioms from which the Bolzano-Weierstrass\n Theorem[21]\n can be proved? How much set theory, comprehension, choice, induction,\netc is needed? Since \\(Z_2\\) is a natural and sufficient environment\nfor many mathematical theorems, it is an appropriate framework for\nanswering questions raised by the reverse mathematics program. The\nmain (but not the only) distinctions that are made in reverse\nmathematics concern the amount of the Comprehension Principle that is\nneeded in proving this or that mathematical result. In particular, the\nrole of Arithmetic and \\(\\Pi^1_1\\)-Comprehension Principles is\nclarified. The basic theory of real numbers can be developed on the\nbasis of Arithmetic Comprehension only, but proofs relying on the\nnotion of a countable ordinal require the \\(\\Pi^1_1\\)-Comprehension\nPrinciple. Again, we refer to Simpson (1999 [2009]) for details.\n\n15. Second-Order Set Theory\n\nWe have up to now treated set theory (ZFC) as a first order theory.\nHowever, when Zermelo (1930) introduced the axioms which constitute\nthe modern ZFC axiom system, he formulated the axioms in second-order\nlogic. In particular, his Separation Axiom is \n\n\\[\\forall x\\,\\forall X\\,\\exists y\\,\\forall z(z\\in Y\\leftrightarrow (z\\in x\\land X(z)))\n\\]\n\n\nand the Replacement Axiom is  \n\n\\[\\forall x\\,\\forall F\\,\\exists y\\,\\forall z(z\\in y\\leftrightarrow\\exists u(u\\in x\\land z=F(u))).\n\\]\n\n\nSecond-order ZFC, \\(\\ZFC^2\\), is simply the received first order ZFC\nwith the Separation Schema replaced by the above single Separation\nAxiom, and the Replacement Schema replaced by the above single\nReplacement Axiom. Accordingly, \\(\\ZFC^2\\) is a finite axiom system.\nZermelo proved that the models of \\(\\ZFC^2\\) are, up to isomorphism,\nof the form \\((V_\\kappa,\\in)\\), where \\(\\kappa\\) is (strongly)\ninaccessible \\(>\\omega\\).\n\nKreisel (1967) has pointed out that second-order set theory in a sense\ndecides the CH, i.e., decides whether it is true or not, even if we do\nnot know which way the decision goes. More exactly \\(\\ZFC^2\\models\nCH\\) or \\(\\ZFC^2\\models \\neg CH\\), because \\(CH\\) is true if and only\nif \\(V_\\kappa\\models CH\\) for inaccessible \\(\\kappa\\), i.e., if and\nonly if \\(\\ZFC^2\\models CH\\). Of course we can express CH in first\norder set theory, too, so the situation is not really different from\nfirst order set theory. Many set theorists think that the concept of\nset is definitive enough to decide eventually also CH even if ZFC does\nnot decide it. Likewise, we may argue that the concept of second-order\nsemantics is definitive enough to decide CH even if the current axioms\nof second-order logic cannot do it.\n\nThe question arises, why do we not use second-order set theory\n\\(\\ZFC^2\\) as the metatheory of second-order logic, as recommended in\nShapiro (1991). In fact we could use it. However, the question might\nrise, what is the semantics of our metatheory? In principle such\nquestions can lead to an infinite regress. By using first order set\ntheory as the metatheory, the question about the semantics of the\nmetatheory would simply be the question about the semantics of first\norder logic. We have pointed out in\n \u00a76\n that semantics of first order logic is absolute relative to ZFC. This\ngives some assurance that we need not continue asking, what the\nmetatheory is.\n\n16. Finite Model Theory\n\nThe rise of mathematical logic in the first half of the twentieth\ncentury was interwoven with different approaches to understanding the\ninfinite structures of the natural and the real numbers. With the\nemergence of computer science in the second half of the twentieth\ncentury logic went through a process of rebirth. The concepts of a\ncomputation and of a database both emphasized the need to understand\nnot so much the finite/infinite distinction as the new measures of\ndegrees of finiteness. For example, the question whether a problem can\nbe decided in polynomial time arose to challenge the well-developed\ntheory of what can be decided in finite time. The analogy between\nfinite relational structures and databases led to the emergence of\nfinite model theory. For a good review we refer to Fagin\n(1993).\n\nIn the context of finite models second-order logic does not suffer\nfrom the same philosophical problems as in the context of infinite\nmodels. It is just one language among many others. One of the early\nsuccesses was the result of Fagin (1974) to the effect that classes of\nmodels definable in existential second-order logic, i.e., in the\n\\(\\Sigma^1_1\\)-fragment, are exactly those that are NP, i.e., that can\nbe recognized by a non-deterministic Turing machine running in time\nwhich is polynomial in the size of the encoding of the model as a\nbinary sequence. The question whether NP is closed under complements\nis notoriously open. From the point of view of second-order logic this\nis surprising because on all models, finite or infinite,\n\\(\\Sigma^1_1\\) is of course not closed under complements. For example,\nthe class of infinite models (in the empty vocabulary) is\n\\(\\Sigma^1_1\\) but not \\(\\Pi^1_1\\). Also, the class of well-orders is\n\\(\\Pi^1_1\\) but not \\(\\Sigma^1_1\\). Therefore the following early\nresult about second-order logic on finite models was remarkable. Here\n\\(\\mon\\Sigma^1_1\\) refers to \\(\\Sigma^1_1\\) in monadic second-order\nlogic, similarly \\(\\mon\\Pi^1_1\\).\n\n\nTheorem 17 (Fagin 1975) Connectivity of graphs is not\ndefinable in \\(\\mon\\Sigma^1_1\\). Hence\n\\(\\mon\\Sigma^1_1\\ne\\mon\\Pi^1_1\\).\n\n\nThis has subsequently been extended to graphs with certain other\nstructure present, see Fagin, Stockmeyer, and Vardi (1995). The proofs\nuse the Ehrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9 games (see\n \u00a73.1)\n and their elaborations.\n\nLet \\(\\Sigma^1_{1,m}\\) denote the class of \\(\\Sigma^1_1\\)-formulas\n\\(\\exists X_1\\ldots\\exists X_k\\phi\\), where the bound second-order\nvariables \\(X_i\\) are at most m-ary and \\(\\phi\\) is first\norder. Similarly \\(\\Pi^1_{1,m}\\) and \\(\\Delta^1_{1,m}\\).\n\n\nTheorem 18 (Ajtai 1983) The property of a finite\nstructure \\((A,R)\\), where R is \\(n+1\\)-ary, of \\(|R|\\) being\neven, is \\(\\Delta^1_{1,n+1}\\) but not \\(\\Sigma^1_{1,n}\\) or\n\\(\\Pi^1_{1,n}\\).\n\n\nThis highly non-trivial theorem is one of the corner stones of the\nstudy of second-order logic on finite structures. We do not know\nwhether \\(\\Delta^1_1\\) is different from \\(\\Sigma^1_1\\) on finite\nstructures, but the above theorem gives an arity-based hierarchy\nresult inside \\(\\Delta^1_1\\).\n\n",
