    "main_text": "Preliminaries || Two Types of Philosophy\n1.1 Two Types of Philosophy\n\nAcademic philosophy, or autonomous philosophy as practiced in the\nWest since the Enlightenment, did not begin in Latin America\nuntil the first half of the twentieth century. Initially, the reigning\nphilosophical paradigm in the region was Scholasticism. That medieval\nstyle of philosophy prevailed during the colonial period, which\nextended roughly from the early sixteenth century to the early\nnineteenth century. Mainly confined to rehearsing the doctrines of\nclassical and medieval European philosophers, Latin American\nScholasticism was not to be challenged until the eighteenth century,\nwhen the theories of the Enlightenment and the rise of modern\nphilosophy began to be known in the American colonies of Spain and\nPortugal.\n\nParallel to these philosophical developments, a non-academic type of\nphilosophy consistently prospered in Latin America from the sixteenth\ncentury to the present. It comprises philosophical positions expressed\nin essay format, a hybrid genre cultivated by political and religious\nleaders, scientists, and literary figures among others. Interested in\nthe intersection of philosophy with literature, religion, and\npolitics, non-academic philosophical thinkers made significant\ncontributions to the intellectual history of Latin America. As may be\nexpected, however, the line separating academic and non-academic\nphilosophy is not always sharp. Although it\u2019s clear that a work\nsuch as the Labyrinth of Solitude, by the Mexican writer and\ndiplomat Octavio Paz \n (1914\u20131998)[1]\n falls within the latter, and L\u00f3gica viva (Living\nLogic), by Uruguayan philosopher Carlos Vaz Ferreira\n(1872\u20131958) falls within the former, there are many borderline\ncases. Consider Lascasianism: first developed by the Dominican friar\nand theologian Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas (Spanish-born,\n1474\u20131566) in colonial times, the doctrine is still influential\nin the work of Peruvian Gustavo Gutti\u00e9rrez and other\ncontemporary liberation theologians. It advocates a perfectionist\nversion of Roman Catholic ethics according to which the ways of life\nthat should be promoted are those that make people more\nhuman\u2014a thesis consistent with las Casas\u2019 1552\nvindication of the humanity of Amerindians (i.e., their\npersonhood). Since Lascasianism has philosophical grounds and\nimplications but is a product of amateur philosophers, it stands out\nas a prime borderline case between academic and non-academic\nphilosophy.\n",
