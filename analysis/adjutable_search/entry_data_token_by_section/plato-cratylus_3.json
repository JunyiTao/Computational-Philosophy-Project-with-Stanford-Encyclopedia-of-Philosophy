Today, a convention ensures that \u201cBoris\nJohnson\u201d is a correct name for a former prime minister of the\nUnited Kingdom; but if Hermogenes is right, this convention might be\nchanged tomorrow, and the very same name might then be a correct name\nfor the cat that currently lives in 10 Downing Street. One can thus\nnever go wrong in imposing a name on a given (kind of)\nobject\u2014such an act will automatically turn the name into a\ncorrect name for this (kind of) object.\n\nAs it stands, this claim seems plausible. Note, however, that it needs\nto be distinguished very carefully from the infinitely less plausible\nclaim that one cannot go wrong in using a name that has already been\nimposed on some (kind of) object. Scholars used to agree that\nHermogenes fails to make this vital distinction: that he does not keep\napart name imposition and name use and thus ends up denying the\npossibility of misapplying a name and, ultimately, the possibility of\nfalse speaking (see, e.g., Gold 1978: 242f.; Williams 1982: 90; and\nMackenzie 1986: 126). But as more recent work (especially Barney 1997)\nhas demonstrated, this diagnosis is not borne out by the evidence. For\nHermogenes consistently uses the term tithenai to refer to\nacts of name imposition and the term kalein to refer to acts\nof name use. Given this terminological circumspection, it would be\nuncharitable to charge him with a crude conceptual confusion.\n(However, see Healow 2020 for a defense of the claim that Hermogenes\nis less clear about the distinction between name imposition and name\nuse at 384c\u2013e than at 385d\u2013e.)\n\nBut who exactly has the authority to impose names on\nthings\u2014linguistic communities or even individual speakers?\nPressed on this point, Hermogenes opts for the latter option\n(385a\u2013b). If you decide to impose the name \u201cBoris\nJohnson\u201d on the cat that lives in 10 Downing Street while all\nother speakers continue to use this name for the former prime\nminister, \u201cBoris Johnson\u201d will be a private correct name\nfor the cat and a public correct name for its former human\nhousemate\u2014or so Hermogenes says. This concession does not imply,\nas scholars used to think, that a speaker with solipsistic\ninclinations can apply names in a way that is in principle immune to\ncriticism and correction (see, e.g., Robinson 1956: 338; Kahn 1973:\n158f.; and Baxter 1992: 18). For Hermogenes never considers naming\nconventions that are private in the sense that no other speakers could\npossibly become party to them; he talks about naming conventions that\nare accidentally private, not about naming conventions that\nare essentially private. And it is hard to see how a\nspeaker\u2019s adherence to naming conventions that are only\naccidentally private would allow her to apply names in a way that is\nin principle immune to criticism and correction (Barney 1997:\n152\u2013156).\n\nWhile older discussions of the passage 383a\u2013386e thus tended to\npaint Hermogenes as a confused or radical \u201canything goes\u201d\nconventionalist, there are good and widely accepted reasons for\nreversing this traditional verdict. All Hermogenes wishes to claim is,\napparently, that speakers are at least in principle completely free to\nimpose any name they like on any given (kind of) object. And\nthis view seems to be very much in tune with common\nsense.\n",
