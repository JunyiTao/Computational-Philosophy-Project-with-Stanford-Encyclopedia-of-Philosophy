    "main_text": "Historical treatments || Aristotle\u2019s identification of a non-conjunctive specification relation\n1.1 Aristotle\u2019s identification of a non-conjunctive specification relation\n\nSome recent commentators have suggested that the notion of\ndetermination has a precursor in ancient times. For example, Granger\n(1984) has proposed that Aristotle\u2019s preferred treatment of the\nrelation between kinds and forms (a.k.a. genus and species) involves\nkey features of determination. Granger suggests that Aristotle\u2019s\nconception of a form/species evolves from a conjunctive conception (as\nin Topics VI.3. 140a27\u201329) to one on which differentia\nentail their associated kind/genus rather than conjunctively\nsupplementing it. Granger motivates the non-conjunctive conception on\ngrounds that \u201cAristotle clearly maintains that [...] the genus\ndoes not exist apart from its species, or exists merely as\nmatter\u201d (1984: 15); in turn, he takes this conception to\nindicate that\n\n\ngenus and differentia are best viewed in terms of determinable and\ndeterminate. [\u2026] A determinate [\u2026] is not a conjunction\nof its determinable and something else logically distinct from its\ndeterminable. (1984: 19)\n\n\nSalmieri (2008) offers further support for this interpretation, citing\nanother important feature of determination\u2014namely, that\ndeterminates differ specifically in respect of their determinable. As\nSalmieri puts it,\n\n\nCertain things are not merely other than one another\u2014as\nblue is other to both loud and\ninflation\u2014but are different from or \u201copponent\nto\u201d one another, as blue is different from\nred. (2008: 78)\n\n\nAnd he sees this distinction as operative in Aristotle\u2019s\n(Metaphysics I.3\u20134) remarks:\n\n\nBut difference (\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1\u0300)\nand otherness (\u1f10\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2) are\ndistinct (\u1f00\u0301\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf). For, while the\nother and that which it is other than are not necessarily other in\nsomething (for everything that is some being is either other or the\nsame), the different differs from something in something, so that\nit\u2019s necessary for there to be something the same in which they\ndiffer. This same thing is a kind or form; for every different thing\ndiffers either {i} in kind or {ii} in form [...]. (1054b22\u201331\ncf. 1018a9\u201315; translation quoted from Salmieri 2008, 79)\n\n\nThe previous features\u2014non-conjunctive entailment of the less by\nthe more specific, the specification\u2019s being somehow \u201cin\nrespect of\u201d the less specific, and the more specific\nfeatures\u2019 being opponent to one other\u2014are indeed\ncharacteristic features of determination, contrasting with other\nspecification relations (modulo deflationary strategies; we\nwon\u2019t always carry this qualification forward). As such, there\nis at least a case here for Salmieri\u2019s claim that \u201cwe\nought to recognise Aristotle as the originator of this\ndistinction\u201d (2008: 79).\n",
