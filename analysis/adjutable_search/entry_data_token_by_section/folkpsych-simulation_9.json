The Role of Mental Simulation in Mindreading\n\nIn the previous section, we examined the case for the psychological\nreality of mental simulation. We now turn to ST as a theory of\nmindreading. We will tackle two main issues: the extent to which\nmindreading is simulation-based, and how simulation-based mindreading\nworks.\n",
