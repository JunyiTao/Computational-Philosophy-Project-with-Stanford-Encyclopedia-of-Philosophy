    "main_text": "Engagement vs. Detachment\n2. Engagement vs. Detachment\nFrom Plato onward, Western philosophy has generally prioritized a\nmethodology grounded in a perspective of rational detachment and\nobjectivity to arrive at truths that are immutable and timeless. By\npracticing what Merleau-Ponty disparagingly calls, \u201chigh-altitude\nthinking\u201d (1964 [1968], 73), the philosopher adopts a perspective\nthat is detached and impersonal, a \u201cGod\u2019s eye view\u201d\nor \u201cview from nowhere\u201d uncorrupted by the contingencies of\nour emotions, our embodiment, or the prejudices of our time and place.\nIn this way the philosopher can grasp the \u201creality\u201d behind\nthe flux of \u201cappearances,\u201d the essential and timeless\nnature of things \u201cunder the perspective of eternity\u201d\n(sub specie aeternitatis). Existentialism offers a\nthoroughgoing rejection of this view, arguing that we cannot look down\non the human condition from a detached, third-person perspective\nbecause we are already thrown into the self-interpreting event or\nactivity of existing, an activity that is always embodied, felt, and\nhistorically situated. Existence, then, is generally grasped not just\nthrough dispassionate theorizing but through a careful analysis of\nfirst-person experience, of the concrete, flesh and blood particulars\nof everyday life and the feelings, relationships, and commitments that\nmake us who we are. It is a philosophy that begins from the standpoint\nof the engag\u00e9, of the individual who is engaged in life\nand who confronts the givens of existence.\n",
