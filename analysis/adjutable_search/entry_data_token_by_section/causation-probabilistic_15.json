    "main_text": "Causal Modeling\n3. Causal Modeling\n\nThe discussion of the previous section conveys some of the complexity\nof the problem of inferring causal relationships from probabilistic\ncorrelations. Fairly recently, a number of techniques have been\ndeveloped for representing systems of causal relationships, and for\ninferring causal relationships from probabilities. The name\n\u2018causal modeling\u2019 is often used to describe the new\ninterdisciplinary field devoted to the study of methods of causal\ninference. This field includes contributions from statistics,\nartificial intelligence, philosophy, econometrics, epidemiology, and\nother disciplines. Within this field, the research programs that have\nattracted the greatest philosophical interest are those of the\ncomputer scientist Judea Pearl and his collaborators, and of the\nphilosophers Peter Spirtes, Clark Glymour, and Richard Scheines (SGS)\nand their collaborators. The most significant works of these authors\nare Pearl (2009) (first published in 2000), and Spirtes et al. (2000)\n(first published in 1993).\n",
