    "main_text": "Perceptual Phenomena\n2. Perceptual Phenomena\n\nLet us now consider the significance for epistemology of a range of\nperceptual phenomena. On most views, these phenomena do not occur in\nall cases of perception, but still have important ramifications for\nthe epistemology of perception.\n\nThe first array of phenomena are concerned with the relation between\nexperience and the world. Here we will consider different kinds of\nperceptual error, as well as forms of perception that occur only in\nthe absence of error. The remaining phenomena we will consider are\ncharacterized by the internal etiology of experience. Here we will\nlook at the influence of attention and of other mental states on our\nexperience.\n2.1. Perceptual Error\n2.1.1 Illusion and Hallucination\n\nIn cases of perceptual error, we form a false belief on the basis of a\nmisleading experience, as when an uninformed subject concludes there\nis motion below (to get the effect, let your eyes drift over the\nimage):\n\n\n\nFigure 3. \u201cRotating\n snakes\u201d[3]\n\n\nThis is a paradigm case of an illusion, where you do see a scene, but\nmisperceive what the scene is like. In a paradigm case of\nhallucination, you have a perceptual experience, but do not perceive\nanything in the scene before you.\n\nFew dispute that there are cases of perceptual error (although some\ndisagree about whether perceptual error is ever properly at the level\nof experience as opposed to that of beliefs formed on the basis of\nexperiences, cf. Brewer 2006). Many skeptical arguments use the\noccurrence of perceptual error to conclude that experiences do not do\na particular job in epistemology. We can understand these arguments as\nusing different versions of the Epistemology-Mind Link:\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link7\n\nIf experiences sometimes deceive us, then experiences do not give us\nknowledge of the external world.\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link8\n\nIf experiences sometimes deceive us, then experiences do not give us\njustified beliefs about the external world.\n\nFor discussion of how to supplement or defend such principles, see the\nentries on\n skepticism\n and\n epistemological problems of perception.\n\nHere we will focus on a weaker principle that addresses the kind of\njustification we can get from perceptual experiences:\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link9\n\nIf experiences sometimes deceive us, then experiences at best give us\ninferential justification for beliefs about the external world.\n\nIf our experiences sometime deceive us, there is a \u201cgap\u201d\nbetween our having of the experience and the truth of the proposition\nthey putatively justify. On E-M Link9, some intermediate belief will\nthen be needed to close the gap between experience and truth, for\nexample a belief to the effect that our experiences are reliable.\nGiven the need for an intermediate belief, our experiences will then\narguably fail to give us non-inferential justification for beliefs\nabout the external world. This conclusion is endorsed by some\nphilosophers who still reject skepticism about perceptual\njustification (Cohen 2002; Wright 2004; or White 2006).\n\nE-M Link9 might still lead to skepticism. Consider an auxiliary belief\nmeant to bridge the gap between experience and truth, and ask whether\nwhatever process that lead to it might sometimes deceive us. For\nexample, consider your belief that your experiences are reliable, and\nwhatever process led to your belief that your experiences are\nreliable. That process could arguably lead you to falsely believe your\nexperiences are reliable in a situation where you are radically\ndeceived by an evil demon.\n\nWe now have a gap between the occurring of the process that led to an\nauxiliary belief and the truth of the auxiliary belief. So then,\naccording to the reasoning behind E-M Link9, we would need another\nauxiliary belief to bridge the gap. Since an evil demon could\npresumably deceive us yet again, a threat of vicious regress arises\nhere ((White 2006 articulates this line of thought without endorsing\nit (or explaining where it goes wrong)).\n2.1.2 Dreaming\n\nWe have considered the significance of illusion and hallucination.\nLet\u2019s now examine the case of dreams. Dreams are often\nunderstood to be paradigms of perceptual error, for example by\nDescartes when, discussing his apparent perceptions, he writes\nthat\n\n\nthis would not happen with such distinctness to someone asleep.\nIndeed! As if I did not remember other occasions when I have been\ntricked by exactly similar thoughts while asleep! (PW, p. 13)\n\n\nThe picture of dreaming as a case of perceptual error is challenged by\nSosa (2005).\n\nWe can frame the issue with a simplified argument for skepticism:\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link10\n\nIf our experiences justify beliefs about our present surroundings, our\nexperiences do not frequently deceive us while we dream.\n\nMind4\n\nOur experiences frequently deceive us while we dream.\n\nSo,\n\nNot-Epistemology\n\nOur experiences do not justify our beliefs about our present\nsurroundings.\n\nSosa responds (to a more complex skeptical argument focused on\nknowledge) by defending an alternative conception of dreams known as\n\u201cthe imagination model\u201d. According to the imagination\nmodel, we actually do not form beliefs about our surroundings when we\ndream, or even have perceptual experiences when we dream.\n\nIn defense of the imagination model, consider that, when I go to bed,\nI form and store a belief that I am lying in bed. If I were to form a\nbelief while I am dreaming that I am running away from lions, I would\nthen have a belief that contradicts my stored belief that I am lying\nin bed. Now we arguably do not have such contradictory beliefs while\nwe are dreaming. The view that we form beliefs while dreaming might\nthen be what has to go (Sosa 2005: 6).\n\nLet\u2019s now consider the case of visual experience. On the\nimagination model, when dreaming we do not even have visual\nexperiences with the same conscious character as those we have when\nawake (we leave open whether we have \u201cvisual experiences\u201d\nwhile dreaming in some extended sense). The argument at this stage can\nexploit the earlier conclusion that we do not form beliefs about our\nsurroundings while dreaming. Sosa defends the further thesis on the\ngrounds that, if we did have experiences when dreaming with the\nconscious character of those we have when awake, we would be open to\nepistemic criticism for failing to form beliefs that take our\nexperiences at face value. However when I dream that I am being\nattacked by a lion, but do not believe while I dream that I am being\nattacked by a lion, I arguably am not open to epistemic criticism.\n\nIf the imagination model of dreaming is correct, the skeptical\nargument above is unsound because Mind is false. For discussion of\nwhether Sosa succeeds in blocking the best dreaming arguments for\nskepticism, see Ichikawa 2009. For further discussion specifically of\nthe visual character of dreams, see Schwitzgebel 2011: ch. 1.\n2.2 Successful Perception\n\nSome epistemologists privilege perceptual states that you are in only\nif you are not in cases of illusion or hallucination. On their views,\nthese states are either the only sources of perceptual justification,\nor at any rate the best sources of perceptual justification. In the\nterminology of Hawthorne and Kovakovich 2006, we may call these\nperceptual states \u201csuccess states\u201d.\n\nTo get a sense of some of the candidate states, consider the following\ntable:\n\n\n\n\n \n(Successful)\u00a0vision\nIllusion\nHallucination\n\n\n\n\nHaving a visual experience with the content that \\(a\\) is \\(F\\)\nY \nY \nY \n\n\nSeeing \\(a\\) as being \\(F\\)\nY \nY \nN \n\n\nSeeing that \\(a\\) is \\(F\\)\nY \nN \nN \n\n\nSeeing \\(a\\)\u2019s \\(F\\)ness\nY \nN \nN \n\n\n\n\n(In setting up this table, we assume that hallucinations of a\nparticular object are possible. For discussion, see Johnston 2004 or\nSchellenberg 2010.)\n\n\nEpistemologists differ according to which success states they\nprivilege, what job they assign to the state, and how severely they\nregard the absence of the privileged state.\n\nFor views which privilege seeing that \\(p\\), see\nMcDowell (1982, 1995) or A. Jackson (2011). For views which privilege\nsomething along the lines of\nseeing \\(a\\)\u2019s \\(F\\)ness, see\nJohnston (2006). These states are\nfact-entailing, since as a matter of necessity, you see that\n\\(a\\) is \\(F\\), or\nsee \\(a\\)\u2019s\n\\(F\\)ness, only if \\(a\\)\nis in fact \\(F\\). For a view that\npotentially favors the sort of perceptual state you find in cases of\nvision and illusion rather than hallucination, see Burge (2003). This\nsort of state is relational, since you can be in it only if\nthe relevant object of perception is present in your scene. Assuming\nthat each conscious success state has a counterpart in unconscious\nperception, notice that versions of these views might focus on\nperceptual states in common between conscious subjects and subjects\nwithout conscious perception.\n\nIn principle, you might get perceptual justification from a success\nstate in the good case of vision or illusion, and get the same amount\nof perceptual justification from a non-success state in the bad case\nof hallucination (Lord forthcoming takes up a view with this structure\nregarding reasons for belief). We bracket that sort of approach here.\nIt is more common to hold that you get no perceptual justification in\nthe case of hallucination (e.g., Jackson 2011), or at least a lower\ndegree or different kind of perceptual justification in the case of\nhallucination (e.g., Schellenberg 2013).\n\nLet\u2019s group views that privilege success states under the label\n\u201cSuccess Theory\u201d, and leave open how to adjudicate within\nthe camp.\n\nIn support of Success Theory, one can emphasize the tight connection\nthe approach draws between perceptual justification and truth. On many\nversions of the approach, the state that gives you justification to\nbelieve that \\(a\\) is \\(F\\) guarantees\nthe truth of the belief that \\(a\\) is \\(F\\).\nMoreover, the source of your justification remains\nmental and arguably accessible to you, thus satisfying the demands of\nsome \u201cinternalist\u201d approaches in epistemology that\nprivilege what is inside the subject or accessible in a special way by\nthe subject (Prichard 2012). Moreover, Success Theory has a promising\nconnection with issues about skepticism. They promise to block\nskeptical arguments that assume our evidence is the same between the\ngood case of successful vision and the bad case of radical deception\nor hallucination (McDowell 1995, for a critique, see Wright 2004).\n\nAs an objection to Success Theory, many bring in demands on\njustification that are not satisfied by the most versions of the view.\nFor instance, consider the internalist thesis that, if things seem the\nsame to each of two people from the inside, then those two people are\nequally justified in their beliefs. More specifically, if two people\nhave the same conscious perspective on the world, and the same stored\nbeliefs, then they are the same with respect to the degree of\njustification of their beliefs. This sort of thesis is often motivated\nby considering radically deceived counterparts to us, and appealing to\nthe intuition that such subjects and us are equally justified (Lehrer\nand Cohen 1983; Cohen 1984; Wedgwood 2002; for dispute, see Sutton\n2007 or Littlejohn 2012). Now, if a version of Success Theory predicts\nthat a subject in perceptual error has less justification than a\ncorresponding perceiver, that version might be rejected on the basis\nof its conflict with the internalist thesis.\n\nIn response, one might attempt to explain away the intuition of equal\njustification as instead concerning equal blamelessness or\nexcusability, or at any rate as being correct only if restricted to\nblamelessness or excusability (e.g. Williamson 2007 or forthcoming).\nCritics often try to respond by distinguishing the sort of\nblamelessness or excusability one finds in cases of cognitive delusion\nor brainwashing, from the epistemic status of the beliefs of the\nvictim of an evil demon (Pryor 2001), or by demanding a more thorough\nexplanation of why the victim is indeed blameless or excusable\n(Miracchi forthcoming). Recent literature also steps back to examine\nwhether a substantive distinction can be drawn between justification\nand excusability, surveying potential distinctive explanatory roles\nfor epistemic excuses to play (Greco 2019).\n\nAlternatively, someone with a \u201cdisjunctive theory of\nperception\u201d might insist that the radically deceived subject\ndoes not have the same conscious perspective on the world as the\nsuccessful perceiver (Fish 2013, also the entry on\n the disjunctive theory of perception).\n On this line of thought, to have the conscious perspective of someone\nin a case of perceptual success, you need to be in a case of\nperceptual success. Here the antecedent of the internalist thesis is\nnot satisfied in cases of radical deception. One challenge here is\nthat there are many ways to be deceived. For example, when someone\nsees that a lemon is yellow, they might well lack a conscious\ncounterpart who hallucinates, but they arguably still have a conscious\ncounterpart who sees a fake lemon that is yellow. If the subject in a\ncase of vision and the subject in a case of illusion are equally\njustified, that will be trouble for approaches that give justifying\nprivilege to the states of seeing that \\(a\\) is \\(F\\)\nor seeing \\(a\\)\u2019s \\(F\\)ness.\n\nSome philosophers might attack Success Theory on the grounds that it\nis too internalist rather than not internalist enough. According to\ntheorists such as Ginsborg 2006 or Roessler 2009, the justifiers of\nperceptual beliefs are best understood to be facts about the external\nworld rather than facts about perceivers\u2019 mind.\n2.3 Attention\n\nStandard cases of perceptual justification are ones in which you\nattend to what you see, as when you attend to your mail and form a\njustified belief that you have mail. But are all cases of perceptual\njustification ones in which attention is involved? According to the\nAttention Needed view, only attentive experiences can provide\njustification. According to the Attention Optional view,\ninattentive experiences can provide propositional justification.\n\nIf you only experience what you attend to, as is maintained by\nphilosophers such as Prinz 2012, all cases of justification by\nexperience will trivially involve attention as well. Here we\u2019ll\npursue the issue on the assumption that we sometimes experience\nsomething we do not attend to, as is held by theorists such as Searle\n1992 and Mole 2011.\n\nTo make our discussion concrete, consider Simons and Chabris\u2019s\n(1999) famous \u201cSelective Attention Test\u201d on youtube (see\nthe link in\n Other Internet Resources).\n When subjects were asked to count passes of basketballs\u2014spoiler\nalert!\u2014a fair number failed to notice a person in a gorilla suit\nwho came into the scene. Given how hard it is to track the passes of\nbasketballs, it is natural to assume that the non-noticers were\nattending only to the basketballs, and did not attend to the person in\nthe gorilla suit. Now suppose that some of non-noticers still did\nexperience a person in a gorilla suit in the scene, as a person in a\ngorilla suit. According to the Attention Needed view, their\ninattentive experience cannot provide them with justification to\nbelieve that someone\u2019s there in a gorilla suit. According to the\nAttention Optional view, their inattentive experience might still\nprovide them with justification to believe that someone\u2019s there\nin a gorilla suit.\n\nBoth views have their attractions. Typically, if you look carelessly\nat a scene, your experience will put you in a worse epistemic position\nif you look attentively at the scene. Perhaps if attention is fully\ngone but experience remains, experience no longer provides\njustification.\n\nOn the other hand, you can have evidence you don\u2019t notice you\nhave, and this point might favor the Attention Optional view. Consider\neveryday cases of \u201cchange blindness\u201d discussed by Dretske\n2004. For example, your friend gets a haircut, and asks you \u201cdo\nI look different?\u201d You are stumped. On Dretske\u2019s account,\nyou might still have a perfectly accurately experience of how his hair\nnow looks. Here your experience plausibly gives you justification to\nbelieve that your friend got a haircut (when combined with your\nbackground beliefs). You also fail to notice that your experience\ngives you justification to believe your friend got a haircut. If\nexperiences provide un-noticed evidence, such cases are arguably good\nprecedents for the sorts of cases allowed by the Attention Optional\nview. (For striking cases of change blindness, see the link in\n Other Internet Resources.)\n\nFor further discussion of the potential epistemic roles of attention,\nsee Campbell 2002, 2011; Roessler 2011; Smithies 2011; Wu 2014; and\nSilins and Siegel 2014.\n2.4 Cognitive Penetration\n\nAccording to one empiricist tradition, experience functions as a\nmirror, reflecting what is before the subject, without any\nmanipulation by the subject\u2019s mind. Given that experience is\nsupposed to not be influenced by one\u2019s theories or expectations,\nit is thereby supposed to be in an optimal position to confirm or\ndisconfirm hypotheses about the world. According to a wide range of\nphilosophers and scientists, such a picture of the nature of\nexperience is mistaken, putting limitations on the ability of\nexperience to justify belief. In the philosophy of science, the\nchallenge has been put in terms of the \u201ctheory-dependence of\nobservation\u201d, and the implications thereof. In more recent\nepistemology and philosophy of mind, the challenge has been put in\nterms of \u201ccognitive penetration\u201d or \u201ctop-down\u201d\neffects and the implications thereof.\n\nTo survey the debate, we\u2019ll start with the philosophy of mind by\nconsidering potential examples of the phenomenon, and we will then\nturn to questions in epistemology.\n\nOne potential source of examples comes from ambiguous figures such as\nthe Necker cube (Hanson 1958; Kuhn 1962; Churchland 1979, 1988).\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Necker\n Cube[4]\n\n\nYou can see this figure as a downward-tilted cube with the left face\nclosest to you, or as an upward-tilted cube with the right face\nclosest to you. Critics dispute whether such examples support any\nthesis of theory-dependence of observation. An alternative\nresponse is that you experience the figure in different ways merely\nbecause you attend to different parts of the figure at different\ntimes. Here the difference in your experience is not explained by\ndifferences in what theory you hold (Fodor 1984).\n\nTheorists such as Hanson, Kuhn and Churchland also made much of work\nby so-called \u201cNew Look\u201d psychologists such as Bruner and\nPostman. Consider for instance Bruner and Postman\u2019s classic 1949\nexperiment involving anomalous playing cards. In this experiment,\nsubjects were briefly shown the following sort of card:\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\nWhat did you just see? When subjects were exposed to this sort of\ncard, many reported it to be a six of hearts. The card is actually a\nred six of spades.\n\nOne might claim that the card looked to you the way red sixes of\nhearts look to you. However, there is much skepticism about whether\nthere is an effect here on perceptual experience itself (Fodor 1983;\nPylyshyn 1999). Perhaps the card fails to look like a red six of\nhearts to you, and you simply jumped to the conclusion that it is a\nred six of hearts when you form your belief. The effect might merely\nhave been on beliefs formed on the basis of perceptual experience.\n\nThe current debate about cognitive penetration is informed by more\nrecent experiments in psychology. For a case of a top-down effect in\nthe current literature, consider \u201cmemory color\u201d in Hansen\net al.\u2019s banana (2006). When subjects were asked to adjust an\nimage of a characteristically yellow object until it was achromatic,\nthey overcompensated by adjusting until the image was slightly bluish.\nSubjects did not overcompensate with objects that were not\ncharacteristically yellow. The type of case presented by Hansen et al.\nis much harder to explain away as not really involving top-down\neffects than those in the classic philosophy of science literature.\n(For related examples, see Delk and Fillenbaum 1965 or Olkkonen,\nHansen, and Gegenfurtner 2008. For further discussion of whether and\nhow there might be top-down effects on perception, see Macpherson\n2012, Deroy 2013, Firestone and Scholl 2016; Green 2020).\n\nLet us now turn to the epistemology of cases of cognitive\npenetration.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether all cases of top-down effects are\nproblematic for perceptual justification. Consider the possibility of\ntop-down effects from expertise. For example, perhaps the expert\nradiologist sees more than the novice when looking at an x-ray, and\nperhaps the expert chess-player sees more than the novice when looking\nat a chessboard in mid-game (see the papers in Ericsson 2006 for\ndiscussion of such examples). Further, suppose that the expertise\nexamples are genuine cases of top-down influence. Here the expert is\npresumably at an epistemic advantage thanks to top-down effects, where\nher experience justifies her with respect to those contents that her\nexperience has thanks to her cognitive background (Siegel 2012).\n\nTo see why some cases of top-down effects might be epistemically\nproblematic, consider Siegel\u2019s (2012) hypothetical case of\n\u201cAngry Looking Jack\u201d. Suppose that Jill antecedently has\nan unjustified belief that Jack is angry at her. The next time she\nsees him, he does look angry to her\u2014as a result of a top-down\neffect from her belief. In response to her experience, Jill then\nreaffirms her belief. Is she now justified in believing that Jack is\nangry at her? (Markie 2005 presents a related example of a gold\nprospector whose wishful thinking makes a nugget visually seem to be\ngold).\n\nIf you are inclined to deny that Jill\u2019s belief is justified, you could\nappeal to an intuition that Jill is not justified by her experience in\nbelieving that Jack is angry at her (Siegel 2012). But others may not\nshare the intuition.\n\nAnother strategy is to give a further argument that Jill is not\njustified by her experience in believing that Jack is angry at her.\nFor arguments that appeal to an analogy with the unjustified formation\nof a belief on an unjustified belief, see McGrath (2013) and Siegel\n(2013) (Teng 2021 critically responds). For an argument that appeals\nto an analogy with the unjustified formation of beliefs on the basis\nof emotion, see Vance (2014).",
