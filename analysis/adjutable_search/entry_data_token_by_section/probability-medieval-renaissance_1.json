    "main_text": "Medieval probability-related terminology\n2. Medieval probability-related terminology\n\nTerms, such as the Latin probabilis were already in use in\nthe early Middle Ages and can, for instance, be found in Carolingian\ntexts on rhetoric (e.g., Alcuin, Rhetoric, 113). The ancient\nauthorities on the subject were Cicero and Boethius, whereas\nAristotle\u2019s most seminal statements on probability-related\nconcepts became known only after the middle of the twelfth century\n(see Cox and Ward 2006; Fredborg 1988, 150; Greenberg-Pedersen 1984).\nParticularly significant in this respect were the introduction of\nAristotle\u2019s Topics into academic discourse in the\nmiddle of the twelfth century (but the full impact was not felt before\n1200) and the new translations of Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean\nEthics and Rhetoric in the thirteenth\n century.[3]\n By the end of this century, Aristotle\u2019s definitions had largely\n(though not entirely) supplanted those of Cicero and Boethius in\nscholastic thought. The impact of this change should not be\nexaggerated because the notions of probability held by Cicero and, in\nparticular, Boethius were in significant respects close to those of\nAristotle.\n\nThe main probability-related terms in this period were\nprobabilis, verisimilis, credibilis,\nopinabilis, and some expressions indicating frequency such as\nut frequenter, ut in pluribus, and\nfrequentius. We need to look carefully at the specific\nmeanings of these words and phrases before proceeding to concepts of\nprobability in a narrower sense.\n",
