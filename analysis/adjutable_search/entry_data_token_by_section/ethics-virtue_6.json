    "main_text": "Forms of Virtue Ethics || Target-Centered Virtue Ethics\n2.3 Target-Centered Virtue Ethics\n\nThe touchstone for eudaimonist virtue ethicists is a flourishing human\nlife. For agent-based virtue ethicists it is an exemplary\nagent\u2019s motivations. The target-centered view developed by\nChristine Swanton (2003), by contrast, begins with our existing\nconceptions of the virtues. We already have a passable idea of which\ntraits are virtues and what they involve. Of course, this untutored\nunderstanding can be clarified and improved, and it is one of the\ntasks of the virtue ethicist to help us do precisely that. But rather\nthan stripping things back to something as basic as the motivations we\nwant to imitate or building it up to something as elaborate as an\nentire flourishing life, the target-centered view begins where most\nethics students find themselves, namely, with the idea that\ngenerosity, courage, self-discipline, compassion, and the like get a\ntick of approval. It then examines what these traits involve.\n\nA complete account of virtue will map out 1) its field, 2)\nits mode of responsiveness, 3) its basis of moral\nacknowledgment, and 4) its target. Different virtues are\nconcerned with different fields. Courage, for example, is\nconcerned with what might harm us, whereas generosity is concerned\nwith the sharing of time, talent, and property. The basis of\nacknowledgment of a virtue is the feature within the virtue\u2019s\nfield to which it responds. To continue with our previous examples,\ngenerosity is attentive to the benefits that others might enjoy\nthrough one\u2019s agency, and courage responds to threats to value,\nstatus, or the bonds that exist between oneself and particular others,\nand the fear such threats might generate. A virtue\u2019s\nmode has to do with how it responds to the bases of\nacknowledgment within its field. Generosity promotes a good,\nnamely, another\u2019s benefit, whereas courage defends a\nvalue, bond, or status. Finally, a virtue\u2019s target is\nthat at which it is aimed. Courage aims to control fear and handle\ndanger, while generosity aims to share time, talents, or possessions\nwith others in ways that benefit them.\n\nA virtue, on a target-centered account, \u201cis a\ndisposition to respond to, or acknowledge, items within its field or\nfields in an excellent or good enough way\u201d (Swanton 2003: 19). A\nvirtuous act is an act that hits the target of a virtue,\nwhich is to say that it succeeds in responding to items in its field\nin the specified way (233). Providing a target-centered definition of\na right action requires us to move beyond the analysis of a\nsingle virtue and the actions that follow from it. This is because a\nsingle action context may involve a number of different, overlapping\nfields. Determination might lead me to persist in trying to complete a\ndifficult task even if doing so requires a singleness of purpose. But\nlove for my family might make a different use of my time and\nattention. In order to define right action a target-centered view must\nexplain how we handle different virtues\u2019 conflicting claims on\nour resources. There are at least three different ways to address this\nchallenge. A perfectionist target-centered account would\nstipulate, \u201cAn act is right if and only if it is overall\nvirtuous, and that entails that it is the, or a, best action possible\nin the circumstances\u201d (239\u2013240). A more\npermissive target-centered account would not identify\n\u2018right\u2019 with \u2018best\u2019, but would allow an action\nto count as right provided \u201cit is good enough even if not the\n(or a) best action\u201d (240). A minimalist target-centered\naccount would not even require an action to be good in order to be\nright. On such a view, \u201cAn act is right if and only if it is not\noverall vicious\u201d (240).
