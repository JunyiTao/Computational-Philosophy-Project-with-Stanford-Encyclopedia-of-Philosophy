One answer (defended\nin Chappell 2004, ad loc.) would be that it is a critique of the\nsociety that produces the conceptual divorce between justice and\nbenefit that has just emerged.  Socrates draws an extended parallel\nbetween two types of character, the philosophical man and the man of\nrhetoric, to show that it is better to be the philosophical type.\n\n\nThe Digression is \u201cphilosophically quite pointless,\u201d\naccording to Ryle 1966: 158. Less dismissively, McDowell 1976: 174\nsuggests that the Digression serves \u201ca purpose which, in a\nmodern book, might be served by footnotes or an appendix.\u201d\nSimilarly, Cornford 1935 (83) suggests that Plato aims to give the\nreader some references for anti-relativist arguments that he presents\nelsewhere: \u201cTo argue explicitly against it would perhaps take\nhim too far from the original topic of perception. Instead, he inserts\n[the Digression], which contains allusions to such arguments in other\nworks of his.\u201d\n\n\nPerhaps the Digression paints a picture of what it is like to\nlive in accordance with the two different accounts of\nknowledge, the Protagorean and the Platonist, that Plato is\ncomparing. Thus the Digression shows us what is ethically at stake in\nthe often abstruse debates found elsewhere in the Theaetetus.\nIts point is that we can\u2019t make a decision about what account of\nknowledge to accept without making all sorts of other decisions, not\nonly about the technical, logical and metaphysical matters that are to\nthe fore in the rest of the Theaetetus, but also about\nquestions of deep ethical significance. So, for instance, it can\nhardly be an accident that, at 176c2, the difference between justice\nand injustice is said to be a difference between knowledge\n(gn\u00f4sis) and ignorance (agnoia).\n\n\nAnother common question about the Digression is: does it introduce or\nmention the Platonic Forms? Certainly the Digression uses phrases that\nare indisputably part of the Middle-Period language for the Forms.  If\nPlato uses the language of the theory of Forms in a passage which is\nadmitted on all sides to allude to the themes of the\nRepublic, it strains credulity to imagine that Plato is not\nintentionally referring to the Forms in that passage.\n\n\nOn the other hand, as the Revisionist will point out, the\nTheaetetus does not seem to do much with the Forms\nthat are thus allegedly introduced. But perhaps it would undermine the\nUnitarian reading of the Theaetetus if the Forms\nwere present in the Digression in the role of paradigm\nobjects of knowledge.  For the Unitarian reading, at least on the\nversion that strikes me as most plausible, says that the aim of\nthe Theaetetus is to show that, in the end, we cannot\nconstruct a theory of knowledge without the Forms\u2014a claim which is to\nbe proved by trying and failing, three times, to do so. So if the\nForms were there in the Digression, perhaps that would be a case of\n\u201cgiving the game away.\u201d\n",
