Suppose that\nI am asked: \u2018How do you know that the individual you are talking\nabout\u2014this playwright in another possible world\u2014is\nBertrand Russell rather than, say, G. E. Moore, or Marlene Dietrich,\nor perhaps someone who is also a playwright in the actual world, such\nas Tennessee Williams or Aphra Behn? Don\u2019t you need to be able\nto supply a criterion of transworld identity in order to secure your\nreference to Russell?\u2019 (Cf. Plantinga 1974, 94\u201397; Kripke\n1980, 44\u201347.) It seems clear that the right answer to this\nquestion is \u2018no\u2019. As Kripke has insisted, it seems\nspurious to suggest that the question how we know which individual we\nare referring to when we make such a claim can be answered only by\ninvoking a criterion of transworld identity. For it seems that we can\nsimply stipulate that the individual in question is Bertrand\nRussell (Kripke 1980, 44).\n\nSimilarly, perhaps, if I say that there is some past time at which\nAngela Merkel is a baby, and am asked \u2018How do you know that\nit\u2019s the infant Angela Merkel that you are talking\nabout, rather than some other infant?\u2019, an apparently adequate\nreply is that I am stipulating that the past state of affairs\nI am talking about is one that concerns Merkel (and not some\nother individual). It seems that I can adequately answer the parallel\nquestion in the modal case by saying that I am stipulating\nthat, when I say that there is some possible world in which Russell is\na playwright, the relevant individual in the possible world (if there\nis one) is Russell (and not some other potential or actual\nplaywright).\n",
