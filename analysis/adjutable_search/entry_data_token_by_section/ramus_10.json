    "main_text": "Logic and method || Method\n3.4 Method\n\nMethod was a topic of enormous interest during the sixteenth century.\nAristotle\u2019s words in the Physics\n(184a10\u201322) were difficult to interpret, and all\nsides claimed an inheritance from him. Ramus\u2019 interpretation of\nthe lines in question made it possible for him to maintain that his\nmethod was strictly Aristotelian. The Aristotelians, for their part,\nlargely followed Averroes\u2019 commentary on this passage, which led\nto a very different conclusion (Ramus, Dialectica 1569:\n513\u2013515). The problem was to determine whether method was a way\nof acquiring knowledge or of displaying it. Discussions about\nmethodological issues changed in this period from being merely\ncommentaries on Aristotle to taking into account a wide range of\nconsiderations, including ones belonging to medicine and geometry. The\nconcepts of analysis and synthesis, for example, were borrowed from\ngeometry and soon became the main principles of method. The problem\nfor many logicians was that it was impossible to find relevant\ndiscussions of these concepts in the Prior and Posterior\nAnalytics, despite the titles of these treatises (Gilbert 1960:\n27\u201332). It became obvious that more than one method could exist\nand that there was a difference between methodus and\nordo. The latter term came to be applied to a pedagogical\nmethod, a way of teaching or displaying. But it was also necessary to\nthink about natural vs. artificial methodus and\nordo, as well as considering the correct way of proceeding\nfrom the general to the particular and vice versa.\n\nAmong Aristotelians there was considerable disagreement on these\nissues. But Ramus took an extreme position. He explicitly denied that\nthere could be more than one method and that there was any difference\nbetween methodus and ordo. As a consequence of his\ndefinition of an art, he could not accept any uncertainty as to how\none should proceed or as to whether the procedure should be natural or\nartificial. In his succinct Latin formulation, he claimed that what\nwas notiora nobis, more known to us, must be the same as what\nwas notiora naturae, more known to nature. What is more\ngeneral with respect to nature must consequently have priority in our\nmethod over what is more particular. If you see a living creature in\nthe distance, it is not until you are closer to it that you will be\nable to identify it as a human being, and it will take still more time\nbefore you can eventually recognize who it is. This example shows,\naccording to Ramus, that a method which proceeds from the general to\nthe particular is not arbitrary but natural (Ramus, Quod sit unica\ndoctrinae instituendae methodus, p. 117). Since it was obvious,\nat least to Ramus, that an argument is more general than an\naxioma, or proposition, and that an axioma is more\ngeneral than a syllogism, this proved that his way of organizing logic\nwas the correct one. The other arts should, of course, be constructed\nin the same way. In medicine, for example, it is natural to start with\nthe whole body before you go on to the limbs. When you cure a man who\nhas a wound on his forehead, you can either say that you cure him or\nhis whole body, but not that you cure his eyes or his belly, which,\nlike his forehead, are parts of his body (Ramus, Dialectica\n1569: 487).\n\nThis method was an important part of Ramus\u2019 logic since it had\ndirect relevance for his philosophy as a whole. Every art must be\nfounded on it, given that it was not merely the correct but the only\nmethod. In describing the arts, he and his followers often used large\ndichotomies, set out in diagrams or bracketed tables; but it is important to\nnote that these dichotomies were an instrument to display the\nstructure of an art. They were not\u2014as many historians have\nsupposed\u2014the same thing as the method. Ramus thought it\nessential to construct a system of precepts arranged according to\ntheir degree of generalization, always starting with the more general\nand proceeding toward the more specific. This would make the method\nnatural, so that it reflects nature, just as the arts do. To stress\nthis point, Ramus in some of his writings preferred to call the second\npart of logic not iudicium but dispositio or\narrangement.\n\nConsidering Ramus\u2019 desire to make logic responsive to the needs\nof the humanities, it is reasonable to ask whether the method was\napplicable to artificial products such as poetry or only to natural\nthings. Ramus was aware of the difficulty of demonstrating his natural\nmethod in literature. This was a particular problem for him since he\nwanted students to learn the method by reading the great authors of\nantiquity. According to him, the method was also used by poets like\nVirgil and Horace. He had to admit, however, that the ancients had\nsometimes intentionally departed from it. Therefore, in earlier\neditions of the Dialectica he had included another method, a\nmethodus prudentiae, which, as he pointed out, was really no\ndifferent from the one method. The confusion occasioned by this\nspecial method, however, led Ramus to remove it from later editions of\nthe treatise. Instead, he talked about a methodi secunda\nillustratio, that is, a second representation of the one method\n(Ramus, Dialectica 1623: 93; see Hotson 2007: 48).\n",
