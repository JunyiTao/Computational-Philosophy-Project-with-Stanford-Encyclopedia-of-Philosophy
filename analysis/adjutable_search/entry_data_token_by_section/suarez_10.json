    "main_text": "Distributive Justice\n6. Just War\n\nSu\u00e1rez extended his conception of justice to the arena of war,\nwriting one of the most exhaustive and lucid treatments of the justice\nof war available in the scholastic corpus. It covers justice ad\nbellum, in bello and, also, post bellum.\n\nThe discussion of ad bellum justice concerns the fundamentals\nof just war theory, including: the moral permissibility of war; the\ndifference between defensive and offensive war; legitimate authority\nto declare war; the requirement of a reasonable hope of victory; the\nconstraints imposed by charity in any resort to war; and the moral\nimplications of the domestic costs of wars which are in principle\njust. It also contains a compelling discussion of the duty of\nparticipants in war to investigate the presence of a just cause, as it\napplies to decision-makers, advisors, and various types of combatants,\nincluding mercenaries.\n\nHis discussion of ius in bello considers, among other things:\nthe category of \u201cinnocents\u201d and their immunities; the\n\u201cdoctrine of double effect\u201d as applied to war; the\nself-defence rights of collateral victims; the attendant possibility\nof a war that is just on both sides (if the collateral victims decide\nto defend themselves); and the peculiarities of civil war and the\npermissibility of deceiving the enemy. It also dwells on topics that\nare not typically discussed by today's just war theorists. These\ninclude the difference between participating in highly risky missions\nand using suicide as a weapon, the justice of concerted confrontations\n(both mutually agreed and forced by one of the parties), the\npermissibility of military alliances with infidels, the rights of\nsoldiers against the sovereign, and justice in the distribution of\nbooty.\n\nInterwoven in these discussions one can find topics that today would\nbe classed in the ius post-bellum category, in particular, on\nwhether victory, regardless of its justice, confers rights, and on the\nrights of just victors to the property found in enemy territory. Here,\nto appreciate the basic tenor of his approach, we may survey the\nad bellum just cause requirement.\n\nA just cause of war is \u201ca grave wrong which cannot be avenged or\nrepaired in any other way\u201d (DDB\n 4.1).[17]\n Examples are the unjust seizure of property of the prince or\nsubjects, violations to the rights of nations, and, controversially,\ngrave injuries to the honor or reputation of the prince or the\nsubjects (DDB 4.3).\n\nSu\u00e1rez places significant moral weight on the distinction, only\ntacitly present in Thomas Aquinas's treatment, between defensive and\noffensive or aggressive war. The defensive use of force aims to foil\nan attempt to inflict a wrong. The offensive use of force, by\ncontrast, aims at obtaining some form of satisfaction for wrongful\nharms that have been already perpetrated (DDB 1.6).\nSu\u00e1rez devotes some attention to cases in which applying this\nbinary distinction becomes complicated. Because aggressive or\noffensive war seems morally more problematic, it was natural for\nSu\u00e1rez to devote the most attention to it. Offensive war is an\nessentially a punitive response to the refusal to redress\npast wrongful harms. In the same way that domestic peace requires\nempowering the republic to punish domestic wrongs, so international\npeace requires that someone be vested with the power to punish\ninternational wrongs. Su\u00e1rez reasons that, given the absence of\na commonly acknowledged superior, this power must belong to each\nsovereign. Sovereigns thus assume the role of judges. A just offensive\nwar is therefore the meting out of just punishment (DDB\n4.5).\n\nJustice, however, is not likely to be served if the judge is also a\nparty to the dispute. Su\u00e1rez is well aware of this problem but\ntries to downplay it. He notes that rulers are less inclined than\nprivate persons to act on emotion and the thirst of vengeance.\nMoreover, they are regularly assisted by the more temperate opinion of\ntheir expert advisors. Recognizing that this may not be enough to\nsurmount the problem, Su\u00e1rez candidly says that once we accept\nthat someone must have the power to punish in the international arena,\nfor all their faults, there are simply no better candidates for this\nrole than sovereigns (DDB 4.7). Furthermore, the unjust party\nhas only itself to blame for the judge's partiality since, by refusing\nto give satisfaction, it exposed itself to sentencing by a biased\njudge. The argument comes across as flawed, since whether or not\nsatisfaction was due is precisely part of what is at stake.\n\nThe presence of a just cause of war is not always sufficient to make\nwar morally permissible. Some wars may be just but nevertheless\nviolate other moral injunctions. This may happen, for instance, when a\nwealthy and prosperous country demands satisfaction for a wrong done\nby a poor country, knowing it is impossible for it to do so without\nfalling into utmost deprivation. In these circumstances, resorting to\nwar may be just but nevertheless uncharitable. However, violations of\nthe duties of charity do not impose a posterior duty to restitute, so\nlong as justice has not been infringed (DDB 4.8).\n\nThere is another sense in which the presence of a just cause is not\nsufficient to make war morally permissible. While making decisions\nabout war, the ruler must consider not only whether his cause is just,\nbut also whether its prosecution by the sword is beneficial to the\nrealm's subjects. A war may pursue a just cause and yet involve\ninjustice towards the subjects of the warring country if it manifestly\nharms the subjects' common good. In such cases, the ruler acts as\ntyrant; the subjects are merely treated as means to avenge wrongs done\nto him, while they themselves suffer serious loss (DDB\n4.8).\n\nFor war to be morally permissible, is it necessary that, in addition\nto having a just cause, it is also certain that the just cause will be\nachieved? The Renaissance Thomist commentator, Cardinal Thomas de Vio,\nknown as Cajetan, thought\n so.[18]\n Su\u00e1rez considered such absolute certainty to be unachievable,\nand requiring it to be undesirable: waiting to attain this degree of\ncertainty could result in a dangerous postponement of the business of\njustice. In addition, he thought that this requirement discriminated\nagainst weaker countries by making it more difficult for them to\npursue justice as compared to stronger countries (DDB\n4.10).\n",
