    "main_text": "First Case Study: Confirming Scientific Theories || Summary\n1.5 Summary\n\nWe\u2019ve seen that formalizing confirmation using probability\ntheory yields an account that succeeds in several significant ways: it\nvindicates several truisms about confirmation, it unifies those\ntruisms in a single equation, and it resolves a classic paradox (not\nto mention others we didn\u2019t discuss (Crupi and Tentori\n2010)).\n\nWe also saw that it raises a problem though, the problem of priors,\nwhich formal epistemologists are divided on how to resolve. And there\nare other problems we didn\u2019t explore, most notably the problems\nof\n logical omniscience\n and\n old evidence\n (see subsections of entry on\n Bayesian epistemology).\n\nThese and other problems have led to the exploration and development\nof other approaches to scientific reasoning, and reasoning in general.\nSome stick to the probabilistic framework but develop different\nmethodologies within it (Fisher 1925; Neyman and Pearson 1928a,b;\nRoyall 1997; Mayo 1996; Mayo and Spanos 2011; see entry on the\n philosophy of statistics).\n Others depart from standard probability theory, like\n Dempster-Shafer theory\n (Shafer 1976; see entry on\n formal representations of belief),\n a variant of probability theory meant to solve the problem of the\npriors and make other improvements.\n Ranking theory\n (Spohn 1988, 2012; again see entry on\n formal representations of belief)\n also bears some resemblance to probability theory but draws much\ninspiration from\n possible-world semantics for conditionals\n (see entry on\n indicative conditionals).\n Bootstrapping theory (Glymour 1980; Douven and Meijs 2006) leaves the\nprobabilistic framework behind entirely, drawing inspiration instead\nfrom the deduction-based approach we began with. Still other\napproaches develop\n non-monotonic logics (see entry),\n logics for making not only deductive inferences, but also defeasible,\ninductive inferences (Pollock 1995, 2008; Horty 2012).\n Formal learning theory\n provides a framework for studying the long-run consequences of a wide\nrange of methodologies.\n\nFor the next two sections we\u2019ll build on the probabilistic\napproach introduced here, since it\u2019s currently the most popular\nand influential approach to formal epistemology. But it\u2019s\nimportant to remember that there is a rich and variegated range of\nalternative approaches, and that this one has its problems, some\nconsequences of which we\u2019ll soon encounter.\n",
