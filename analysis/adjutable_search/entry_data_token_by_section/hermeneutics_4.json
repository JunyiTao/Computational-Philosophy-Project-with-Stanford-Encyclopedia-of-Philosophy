Hermeneutics as Historical Movement\n\nHermeneutics, taken as a historical movement, is informed by a longer\nhistory that dates back to antiquity. The modern history of\nhermeneutics originates with figures in nineteenth- and early\ntwentieth-century German thought, especially Friedrich Schleiermacher\nand Wilhelm Dilthey. Contemporary hermeneutics is shaped, in turn,\nespecially by Martin Heidegger and Hans-Georg Gadamer, as well as by\nPaul Ricoeur and others (see Palmer 1969, Grondin 1994, L. Schmidt\n2006, Zimmerman 2015).\n",
