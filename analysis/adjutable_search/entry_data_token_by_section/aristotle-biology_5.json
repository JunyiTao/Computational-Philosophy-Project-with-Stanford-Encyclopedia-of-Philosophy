(PA I, it will be recalled, is\na discussion of the norms that are needed to guide the scientific\ninvestigation of animals; see section 4, above.) Here, I will be\nnarrowly focused on just a couple of passages in PA II-IV,\nbut will begin with a very brief sketch of its overall structure. It\nbegins (PA II 1\u20132) with a careful and complex\ndiscussion of the causal relationships between uniform and non-uniform\nparts (roughly, this distinction corresponds to our distinction\nbetween bodily fluids and tissues and organs), stressing the\nteleological priority of the whole organism to the parts, and among\nparts the priority of the non-uniform to the uniform. PA II\n3\u201310 then discusses the uniform parts, beginning with that out\nof which all the others are nourished, blood, and ending with flesh,\nbone, and analogous materials (nail, horn, hoof). From II 10 to III 3,\nAristotle discusses the external parts of blooded animals associated\nwith the head such as eyes, ears, nose and mouth. But when he gets to\nthe neck, he turns to the internal parts, and from III 3 to IV 4 he\ndiscusses the \u2018innards\u2019 of the blooded animals, parts such\nas heart, lung, liver, kidneys, and so on. From IV 5 to 9 he discusses\nthe parts, both internal and external, of the \u2018bloodless\u2019\nanimals, i.e. the crustaceans, testaceous mollusks, cephalopods and\ninsects. Finally, at IV 10, he returns to the external parts\nassociated with the torso and limbs of the live bearing and egg laying\nquadrupeds (10\u201311), birds (12), and fish (13); and ends by\ndiscussing a number of animals that \u2018dualize\u2019 between\nbeing land-dwellers and water dwellers or flyers.\n\nIn order to compare the methods of this treatise with the discussion\nof the parts in HA, it will be useful to look briefly at\nPA III 3, a discussion of the lung, windpipe and esophagus,\nthe part discussed in the passage from HA II quoted in section 5.1,\nabove. The first twenty lines of that discussion read as follows:\n\n\n\nNot all animals have a neck, but only those with the parts for the\nsake of which the neck is naturally present\u2014these\nare the windpipe and the part known as the esophagus. Now the larynx\nis present by nature for the sake of breathing; for it is\nthrough this part that animals draw in and expel air when they inhale\nand exhale. This is why those without a lung have no neck,\ne.g. the kind consisting of the fish. The esophagus is the part\nthrough which nourishment proceeds to the gut; so that animals without\nnecks manifestly do not have an esophagus. But it is not\nnecessary to have the esophagus for the sake of\nnutrition; for it concocts nothing. And further, it is\npossible for the gut to be placed right next to the position\nof the mouth, while for the lung this is impossible. For\nthere needs first to be something common like a conduit,\nwhich then divides in two and through which the air is separated into\npassages\u2014in this way the lung may best accomplish\ninhalation and exhalation.\n\nSo, then, the organ connected with breathing from necessity\nhas length; therefore it is necessary for there to be an\nesophagus between the mouth and the stomach. The esophagus is fleshy,\nwith a sinuous elasticity\u2014sinuous so that it\nmay dilate when food is ingested, yet fleshy so that\nit is soft and yielding and is not damaged when it is scraped by the\nfood going down. (664a14\u201334)\n\n\nI have highlighted the language of nature, necessity, possibility\n(and impossibility), and being for the sake of in this passage in\norder to highlight the contrast with the discussion of the same\norganic correlations in the corresponding HA passage. Here\nthe goal is explanation\u2014parts are present and have the\ncharacter they do primarily due to the conditional necessity imposed\nby the organism\u2019s functional requirements. One sees here the\nAristotle that so impressed the great French naturalist Georges\nCuvier: Aristotle is not only systematically discussing the adaptive\nfunctions of each of these organs; he is also displaying the complex\nway in which the internal parts of animals constitute an organic\nsystem.\n\nThe lack of names for animal kinds is also noteworthy; as in the\ncorresponding passage from HA II, fish are mentioned once as\nan instance of blooded animals that lack the organs in question; but\nthe stress throughout is on this particular system of organs in\nwhichever blooded animals have them. Aristotle\u2019s goal is to\nexplain why it is that certain animals have these organs, and why it\nis that, if they have one of these organs, they must\nhave the others. Some, but not all, of the explanations specify the\nfunction for the sake of which the parts are present; and even the\nmaterial nature of the tissues, whether fleshy or sinuous, may be\nexplained in functional terms. This discussion also displays a\nhierarchy of teleological connections of the sort described\nat the close of PA I 5, 645b28\u201333\u2014one activity is\npresent for the sake of another more basic one; a part that performs a\nsubordinate activity is present for the sake of a part that performs a\nmore important activity. Inhaling and exhaling are for the sake of\nrespiration (which is for the sake of cooling the blood); a windpipe\nis present for the sake of transporting air to and from the lung; a\nneck is present to protect the windpipe.\n\nFor reasons that will become clear, the relationship between the books\nof the Historia Animalium dealing with generation and On\nthe Generation of Animals (GA) is somewhat more complex.\nGA has a reasonably clear organization of its own; but its\ncentral (though not only) project of explaining the causal\nroles of the male and female in sexual generation and the causality of\nembryological development raises a host of topics and problems well\nbeyond the scope of HA. But a study of how the two works are\nrelated is nonetheless illuminating. This discussion of\nAristotle\u2019s biological practice will thus close by considering\nthe causal explanation of embryological development and in particular\nthe explanation for the early appearance of the heart, with a final\nlook at the application of this explanation to the case of embryonic\nbirds.\n\nAs I noted earlier, taken on its own terms, GA has a\nreasonably clear structure. Here again, as with PA II-IV, I will begin\nwith a brief sketch of its overall structure, before focusing narrowly\non its method as applied to one problem. It begins (715a1\u201318) by\nnoting that it will explain two sets of facts left unexplained in\nPA: the differences among the parts related to generation;\nand the generation of the parts generally. Though he\nacknowledges that some animals do not have males and females, he\ntreats sexual generation as his central topic. Initially he provides a\ntheoretically \u2018neutral\u2019 account of the distinction: the\nmale is what generates in another, the female what generates in itself\n(716a14\u201315). It is not until late in book I that he begins to\ndevelop his own detailed theory of their distinctive contributions to\ngeneration.\n\nThe first 13 chapters characterize the reproductive organs in the\nmales and females of blooded animals, while 14\u201316 do the same\nfor the bloodless animals that have males and females. Beginning in\nchapter 17, the discussion turns to the relevant uniform\nparts related to generation, sperma (roughly\n\u2018seed\u2019) and milk, but the discussion of milk is postponed\nuntil book IV. This immediately raises the contentious issue of\nwhether both male and female contribute sperma, and\nif both, then what the nature of their respective contributions is.\nThis is a large part of the discussion from I 17-II 5, one of the most\ndifficult stretches of text in the Aristotelian corpus, and the one on\nwhich our attention will be focused. But to continue our overview: the\nremainder of book II (from chapter 5 on) discusses the causes of the\nembryological development of live-bearing animals, while the\negg-laying animals are the primary focus in book III, which closes\nwith a discussion of animals that are not sexually generated,\nincluding those that arise \u2018spontaneously.\u2019 GA IV\nturns to the development of inherited differences within kinds,\nbeginning with the most important intra-specific difference for his\ntheory of generation, the difference between male and female. From\nthere it moves on to family resemblance, differences in the number of\noffspring produced and to the causes of deformities. GA V\naims to explain \u2018more and less\u2019 variations within kinds\nthat appear late in development and that may be fully accounted for by\nidentifying material level causal interactions\u2014differences\nwithin a kind in the color, texture or density of a part, for\nexample.\n\nThe remainder of this discussion will focus on the general causal\ntheory of animal generation developed in the first half of GA\n II.[12]\n In the closing chapters of book I, Aristotle argues that both the\nmale and female contributions are formed from a \u2018useful\nresidue\u2019 of blood by a concocting process, the male\u2019s\nbeing more fully concocted than the female\u2019s. From this point on\nthe male\u2019s contribution is typically termed gon\u00ea\n(semen), and the female\u2019s katamenia (menses). Aristotle\nis not entirely consistent, however: occasionally he uses the generic\nterm sperma for the male contribution and explicitly\ncontrasts it with katamenia (727a27\u201330); while at other\ntimes he refers to katamenia as a sort of sperma\n(728a26\u201329).\n\nThe two contributions are variously described. The male contributes a\nsource of movement or dunamis (\u2018power\u2019 or\n\u2018potential\u2019), which, as the argument unfolds, turns out to\nbe a special sort of capacity to heat present in the semen\u2019s\npneuma or air, which is part of its nature. (This gets fully\nworked out in GA II 2\u20133) The semen itself is mere a\nvehicle for delivering this heating capacity; the male makes no\nmaterial contribution to the offspring. The female contributes what\nmight be called \u2018prepared matter\u2019; all it needs is the\npresence within it of the heating capacity from the male and it begins\na more or less lengthy and complicated developmental process, which\nAristotle analogizes to a sort of automaton performing a complex set\nof coordinated movements once it is set in motion.\n\nHe relies at several points in the argument on an analogy with crafts,\nsuch as house building:\n\nIn animals that emit semen the nature in the male uses the semen as an\ninstrument possessing active movement, just as the tools are moved in\nthings that come to be by craft; for the movement of the craft is\nsomehow in these tools. (730b20\u201323)\n\n\nThis obscure analogy gradually gets unpacked in the first four\nchapters of GA II. The general principle common to art and\nnature is this:\n\nAs many things as come to be by nature or by art come to be by means\nof a being in actuality from that which is potentially such as that\nbeing. (734b22\u201323)\n\n\nIt is the prepared portion of the female\u2019s katamenia\nthat is potentially such as the contributor of semen is actually. And\nthe semen conveys to it a movement or power, such that \u201cwhen the\nmovement ceases each of the parts comes to be and is ensouled\n(734b24\u201325).\u201d That is, in embryological development, each\npart emerges within a system of parts that is organized to provide\nnutrition for its growth, and that is guided by a complex\n\u2018program\u2019 for its development. Notice that as each part\ncomes to be it already has the functional capacity associated with\nit\u2014it comes to be and is ensouled. Aristotle\ncharacterizes the process as follows:\n\n\nAs for hardness, softness, toughness and fragility and all the other\nsuch affections present in these ensouled parts, these affections\nmight be produced by heat and cold, but not the defining character\n(logos) in virtue of which the one part is flesh and the\nother bone; that is the result of the movement derived from the\ngenerator, being in actuality what that out of which it comes to be is\npotentially, just as in things that come to be by craftsmanship.\n(734b31\u201335)\n\n\nThis passage comes immediately after Aristotle has stressed two\nrelated points: that the uniform parts and the instrumental parts\narise simultaneously; and that even flesh and bone have a function to\nperform. These points are tightly connected. The defining features of\ntissues are not merely their affective qualities such as being hard or\nsoft, but their biological functions as well; and their biological\nfunctions are intimately connected to their roles in\nconstituting\u2014and being able to play functional roles\nin\u2014instrumental parts; many, if not all, of a part\u2019s\naffective qualities are a consequence of its biological role.\n\nIn the process of making this argument, Aristotle also stresses a\ncrucial and problematic dis-analogy: Natural things, once\ntheir generation begins, \u2018grow by means of themselves\u2019\n(735a13\u201314). This is the most fundamental difference between art\nand nature for Aristotle; a nature is a source of change within the\nthing itself (Physics II. 1). Natural development, then,\nthough initiated by the warmth contributed by the male parent,\ncontinues by means of a source of change within the developing embryo.\nThe carpenter may not mix any of his own material in his buildings;\nbut he must be continuously, physically involved in the movements that\ncreate those buildings. Not so with the male parent in natural\ngeneration. So how does a complex process that has its origins in an\nexternal generator become a natural process of development?\n\nFor Aristotle, the heart (or its analogue in bloodless animals) is\ncrucial. It is the first part created by the heat derived from the\nsemen of the male parent, and henceforth it is the primary internal\nsource of that heat and thus of further development (735a16\u201326).\nThe following explanation begins to bring us into contact with our\npassage on generation from the History of Animals.\n\n\u2026in the embryo (kuema), while in a way all the parts\nare present potentially, the source [of development] is most along the\npath to actuality. This is why the heart is first to be differentiated\nin actuality. And this is not only clear to perception (as it\nhappens), but is also clear to reason. When the developing thing is\ndistinct from both the male and female contributions, it must manage\nitself, as when a son sets up a home away from his father. So in\nanimals there must be a source of generation from which the later\norganizing of the body comes about. \u2026 Wherefore the heart\nappears differentiated first in all blooded animals; for it is the\nsource of both the uniform and the non-uniform parts. \u2026 And the\nprepared blood or its analogue is nutrient for the animal, and the\nblood vessels are its repository; for this reason the heart is their\nsource. This is clear from a study of \u2018the histories\u2019 and\n\u2018the dissections\u2019. (740a2\u201323, excerpted; compare\n735a12\u201326, 738b17\u201318 740a27\u201336, 742b34\u2013743a1,\n743b26)\n\n\nHaving developed this general explanation during his discussion of his\ncentral case, viviparous development, in GA II, Aristotle\nmoves on to egg-laying animals in book III. GA III 1 carries\nover to them whatever is common to the two cases, with discussion of\nthe development of birds in their eggs beginning in GA III 2.\nA recurring aspect of his argument, here as in PA, is to\nrefer us for descriptive details to the histories (presumably\nthe basis of our HA) and to a collection of representations\nof dissections (tragically not preserved, but cited repeatedly in\nAristotle\u2019s biological writings and in ancient catalogues of his\nwritings).\n\nThe most general differences among egg-layers relate to the\n\u2018completeness\u2019 of the egg when laid. Because birds lay\neggs that become hard as soon as they are exposed to the air\n(752a30-b2), they are taken to be better prepared when laid than the\neggs of other egg-laying animals. Ignoring much interesting and\nimportant detail, we will take up the discussion of development within\nthe eggs of birds as they incubate. Aristotle distinguishes the\n\u2018white\u2019 and the \u2018yolk\u2019, not descriptively as\nhe did in HA, but functionally (752b18\u201328).\n\n\u2026it is the white out of which the animal is constituted, while\nthe yolk becomes nutrient, and growth for the constitution of the\nparts is from it. This is also why the yolk and the white, having\ndistinct natures, have been kept distinct by membranes. For precise\ndetails concerning how these parts are situated in relation to each\nother in virtue of the sources of generation and the constitution of\nanimals, as well as the membranes and umbilical cords, one should\nstudy what has been outlined in the histories. The following appears\nto be sufficient for the present investigation: the heart is the first\nthing constituted; after this the great blood vessel is marked off,\nand two umbilical cords extend from this blood vessel, one to the\nmembrane around the yolk, the other to the membrane surrounding the\nanimal itself. This latter is thus next to the membrane of the shell.\n(753b11\u201323)\n\n\nIn this case (though not always) one does get far more detail in\nHA. These references to histories and dissections can be\nmisleading unless one takes into account the differences in the aims,\nand thus in the organization, of these treatises. In this case, for\nexample, nothing is said in GA about the heart \u2018beating\nand moving as though it were alive\u2019. As we saw, however,\nGA II stresses that in the development of live-bearing\nanimals, the heart is first to be formed, is ensouled from the start,\nand is the source of development for all the other parts\u2014a much\nmore \u2018theory-laden\u2019 characterization that stresses the\nheart\u2019s causal role in development. And because of the\norganizational structure of GA, much of what is said in his\ndiscussion of the live-bearing animals (those that are \u2018more\ncomplete\u2019 when they are born) is assumed to apply to animals\nthat lay eggs (that are \u2018less complete\u2019 when born).\n\nRecall the stunningly accurate discussion of the head and eyes of the\nfour day old chick embryo in HA (in section 5.1, above). This\nis not discussed in GA III 2; however in GA II 6, in\na long discussion of early organ formation in live-bearing\nanimals, Aristotle has a good deal to say on the subject:\n\nWhat happens concerning the eyes of animals presents a problem. For\nfrom the beginning, whether in land animals, swimmers or flyers, they\nappear very large and yet they are among the last of the parts to be\ncompleted and in the mean time contract in size. This is\nbecause the sense organs of the eyes are, as with the other sense\norgans, on channels; but while those for touch and taste are simply\nbodily, or some part of the body of animals, and those for smell and\nhearing are channels connected to the air outside and are full of\nconnate pneuma\u2026the eyes alone have a proper sensory body.\n(743b33\u2013744a6)\n\n\nThe full explanation goes on much longer, but we need not follow it\nout for the purposes of making two important points about the\nrelationship of GA to HA. The first is that the\norganization of GA dictates that for the explanation of facts\nof wide generality such as this one, we must look in book\nII\u2014notice that he claims that this explanation for the large\nsize of eyes early in development and for their subsequent contraction\napplies to all land, air and water animals. The second point to be\nstressed is the relentlessly causal/explanatory focus of the\nGA discussion, a feature (properly) completely absent in the\ncorresponding discussions in HA. As impressive as the\ndescriptive accuracy of the embryological passage cited earlier from\nHA is, we again need to remember what is absent from\nthat discussion. For the equally impressive embryological\ntheory, the reader of Aristotle\u2019s biology must turn to\nthe Generation of Animals.\n",
