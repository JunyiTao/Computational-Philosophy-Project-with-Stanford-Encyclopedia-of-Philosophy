    "main_text": "New Directions for Neutral Monism || Information as Ultimate Reality\n5.1 Information as Ultimate Reality\n\nAnticipating the current revival in interest in neutral monism by a\nfew decades, Kenneth Sayre (1929\u2013) published his main ideas on\nneutral monism in the 1970s. Unlike the big three, Sayre\nfinds the neutral base of his system not in experience, but in the\nform of pure information, where information is understood in the\nstrict information theoretical sense. His proposal must not be\nmistaken for the uncontroversial claim that that mental and physical\nprocesses can be described in information theoretic terms.\nSayre puts forward an ontological claim about the ultimate nature of\nreality\u2014that ultimate reality consists of informational\nstates:\n\nIf the project\u2026is successful, it will have been shown not only\nthat the concept of information provides a primitive for the analysis\nof both the physical and the mental, but also that states of\ninformation\u2026existed previously to states of mind. Since\ninformation in this sense is prior to mentality, but also implicated\nin all mental states, it follows that information is prior also in the\nontological sense\u2026Success of the present project thus will show\nthat an ontology of informational states is adequate for an\nexplanation of the phenomena of mind, as distinct from an ontology of\nphysical events. [And Sayre adds:] It is a reasonable conjecture that\nan ontology of information is similarly basic to the physical\nsciences\u2026. (Sayre 1976: 16)\n\n\nOne of the greatest challenges faced by the traditional versions of\nneutral monism is to show how basic entities that are derived from\nexperience can be neutral, rather than mental. By choosing an ontology\nof informational states as his \u201cneutral stuff\u201d, Sayre\nelegantly bypasses this problem. But while the neutrality of\ninformational states may be taken for granted, the question of the\nrelationship of this seemingly abstract \u201cstuff\u201d to\nconcrete world of physical and mental entities becomes all the more\n pressing.[21]\n\nSayre\u2019s main work on neutral monism is his 1976. In recent\ndecades, David Chalmers has similarly explored the idea of an\ninformational ontology (see Chalmers 1996). And the related ideas that\nultimate reality is purely structural (Ladyman and Ross 2007; Floridi\n2008, 2009), is a computational process (Fredkin 2003; Lloyd 2006), or\nis purely mathematical (Tegmark 2014) are the subject of a lively\ndiscussion.\n",
