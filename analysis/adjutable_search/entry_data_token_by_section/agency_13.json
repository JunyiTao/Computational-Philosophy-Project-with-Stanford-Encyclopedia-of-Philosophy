    "main_text": "Empirical challenges and the role of consciousness || Situationism\n4.2 Situationism\nIt seems that the empirical evidence in support of\nsituationism raises a challenge for our commonsense conception of\nagency. According to situationism, empirical research shows that\ncommonsense explanations of actions in terms of character traits (such\nas honesty, kindness, or courage) are systematically mistaken or\ninaccurate, because this research shows that the actions in question\nare better explained in terms of situational features (Ross and\nNisbett 1991; Harman 1999; Doris 2002). But none of the common\nphilosophical theories of agency say that actions are to be explained\nin terms of the agent\u2019s character traits, and so it seems that\nsituationism does not raise a problem for the standard theory and\nother philosophical accounts of agency. Moreover, the interpretation\nof the empirical evidence in question and the argument for\nsituationism have been controversial (Sreenivasan 2002, for\ninstance). It has been argued, however, that this evidence raises the\nfurther question of whether we are genuinely reason-responsive. The\nevidence suggests that our actions are, under certain conditions,\ndriven by situational and morally irrelevant factors even when there\nare salient moral reasons to act otherwise. This suggests that we (or\nmost of us) are not as reason-responsive as we would like to\nthink. But it is controversial whether or not the evidence supports\nany stronger claims than that (for more on this see Nelkin 2005;\nSchlosser 2013; Vargas 2013).\n",
