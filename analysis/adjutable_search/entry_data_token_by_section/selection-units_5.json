    "main_text": "Four Basic Questions || The Manifestor-of-Adaptation Question\n2.4 The Manifestor-of-Adaptation Question\n\nAt what level do adaptations occur? Or, \u201cWhen a population\nevolves by natural selection, what, if anything, is the entity that\ndoes the adapting?\u201d (Sober 1984: 204).\n\nAs mentioned previously, the presence of adaptations at a given level\nof entity is sometimes taken to be a requirement for something to be a\nunit of\n selection.[7]\n Significantly, group selection for \u201cgroup advantage\u201d\nshould be distinguished from group selection per se (Wright\n1980). In fact, the combination of the interactor question with the\nquestion of what entity had adaptations had created a great deal of\nconfusion in the units of selection debates in general.\n\nSome, if not most, of this confusion is a result of a very important\nbut neglected duality in the meaning of \u201cadaptation\u201d (in\nspite of useful discussions in Brandon 1978, Burian 1983, Krimbas\n1984, Sober 1984). Sometimes \u201cadaptation\u201d is taken to\nsignify any trait at all that is a direct result of a selection\nprocess at that level. In this view, any trait that arises directly\nfrom a selection process is claimed to be, by definition, an\nadaptation (e.g., Sober 1984; Brandon 1985, 1990; Arnold &\nFristrup 1982). Sometimes, on the other hand, the term\n\u201cadaptation\u201d is reserved for traits that are \u201cgood\nfor\u201d their owners, that is, those that provide a \u201cbetter\nfit\u201d with the environment, and that intuitively satisfy some\nnotion of \u201cgood\n engineering.\u201d[8]\n These two meanings of adaptation, the selection-product and\nengineering definitions respectively, are distinct, and in\nsome cases, incompatible.\n\nConsider the peppered moth case: natural selection is acting on the\ncolor of the moths over time, and the population evolves, but no\n\u201cengineering\u201d adaptation emerges. Rather, the proportion\nof dark moths simply increases over time, relative to the industrial\nenvironmental conditions, a clear case of evolution by natural\nselection, on which a good fit to the environment is reinforced. Note\nthat the dark moths lie within the range of variation of the ancestral\npopulation; they are simply more frequent now, due to their superior\nfit with the environment. The dark moths are a\n\u201cselection-product\u201d adaptation. Contrast the moth case to\nthe case of Darwin\u2019s finches, in which different species evolved\ndistinct beak shapes specially adapted to their diet of particular\nseeds and foods (Grant & Grant 1989; Grant 1999). Natural\nselection here occurred against constantly changing genetic and\nphenotypic backgrounds in which accumulated selection processes had\nchanged the shapes of the beaks, thus producing\n\u201cengineering\u201d adaptations when natural selection occurred.\nThe finches now possess evolved traits that especially\n\u201cfit\u201d them to their environmental demands; their newly\nshaped beaks are new mechanisms beyond the original range of variation\nin the ancestral population (Lloyd 2015).\n\nSome evolutionary biologists have strongly advocated an engineering\ndefinition of adaptation (e.g., Williams 1966). The basic idea is that\nit is possible to have evolutionary change result from direct\nselection favoring a trait without having to consider that changed\ntrait as an adaptation. Consider, for example, Waddington\u2019s\n(1956) genetic assimilation experiments. How should we interpret the\nresults of Waddington\u2019s experiments in which latent genetic\nvariability was made to express itself phenotypically because of an\nenvironmental pressure (Williams 1966: 70\u201381; see the lucid\ndiscussion in Sober 1984: 199\u2013201)? The question is whether the\nbithorax condition (resulting from direct artificial selection on that\ntrait) should be seen as an adaptive trait, and the engineering\nadaptationist\u2019s answer is that it should not. Instead, the\nbithorax condition is seen as \u201ca disruption\u2026of\ndevelopment,\u201d a failure of the organism to respond (Williams\n1966: 75\u201378). Hence, this analysis drives a wedge between the\nnotion of a trait that is a direct product of a selection process and\na trait that fits the stronger engineering definition of an adaptation\n(see Gould & Lewontin 1979; Sober 1984: 201; cf. Dobzhansky\n 1956).[9]\n\nIn sum, when asking whether a given level of entity possesses\nadaptations, it is necessary to state not only the level of selection\nin question but also which notion of adaptation\u2014either\nselection-product or engineering\u2014is being\nused. This distinction between the two meanings of adaptation also\nturns out to be pivotal in the debates about the efficacy of higher\nlevels of selection, as we will see in sections\n 3.1\n and\n 3.2.\n",
