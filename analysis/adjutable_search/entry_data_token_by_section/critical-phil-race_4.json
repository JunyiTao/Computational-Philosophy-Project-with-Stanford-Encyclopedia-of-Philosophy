Phenomenologies of Race and Racism\n\nPhenomenology was one of the first philosophical resources that CPR\nbegan to use to explore racial effects on experience, subjectivity, and\nsocial relations. Although Existentialism and Phenomenology are\nphilosophical approaches founded by European philosophers who tended to\nignore race, the questions that these traditions focused on from the\nbeginning, concerning anguish and responsibility, freedom, temporality,\nand a prefigured social imaginary, have been of profound concern to the\ndevelopment of the Critical Philosophy of Race (Gordon 1995a, 1997; Lee\n2014, 2019; Yancy 2008; Ngo 2017).\n\nEdmund Husserl initially developed the phenomenological method as a\nway to foreground and critique what he called \u201cthe natural\nattitude\u201d: the unexamined background that helps constitute how we\nexperience the world (Husserl 1939 [1973]). The phenomenological method as\nHusserl imagined it would put this natural attitude in brackets,\nallowing for the possibility of a greater self-awareness through a\ntransformed mode of interacting with the world. Contemporary\nphenomenologists are increasingly concerned with the social structures\nthat produce and reinforce natural attitudes as well as with habits of\nunderstanding that can render our worlds comforting and predictable\n(see e.g. Weiss, Murphy, and Salamon 2019). There is also an increased\nfocus on working through the specificity of differently embodied\nperspectives, or natural attitudes that are correlated to specific\ngroup identities. For example, recent work in the phenomenology of race\nhas developed an analysis of the formation of specific first-person\nexperiences within racist societies, such as an experience of fear that\nfeels natural but is caused by racist projections.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de\nBeauvoir, Frantz Fanon, and Richard Wright began to consider the ways\nin which perception, embodiment, relations with others, experiences of\none\u2019s temporal existence, as well as the way one conceptualizes\nthe natural and social worlds could all be substantively affected by\nracial identities, even if this was latent and unarticulated (Sartre\n1946 [1948]; Beauvoir 1954 [1999]; Fanon 1952; Wright 1940). Fanon took up the\nquestion of black embodiment in anti-black societies, in which\none\u2019s actions would be interpreted by others against the backdrop\nof racist cultural images, curtailing agency and foreclosing\nindividualism as well as the recognition of one as a meaning-making\nsubject. An anticipation of anti-black responses suffuses one\u2019s\neveryday life. Sartre considered the ways in which colonization had\ncreated a situation in which the structural violence of colonizers was\nobscured and the resistance of the colonized was perceived as\nirrational. Beauvoir reflected on how her white identity restricted the\npossibilities of relations with others, reframing the meanings of her\nintended actions in ways that would reinforce racism. And throughout\nhis novels Wright explored the changed possibilities for self-making\nthat were beginning to emerge for black people with the demise of legal\nsegregation.\n\nInspired by this work, new existential categories were developed by\nLewis Gordon (1995a, 1997), Paget Henry (2000), Robert Birt (1997),\nJonathan Judaken (2008), Gertrude James Gonzalez (1997) and others to\nprovide more precise accounts of Black existence in anti-black worlds.\nFor example, there is both invisibility and hyper-visibility: the\ninvisibility of black pain and suffering, now documented in medical\nresearch, against the hyper-visibility of black bodies in spaces\nassumed to be rightfully dominated by whites, which include higher\neducation, government, and institutional leadership of all sorts, now\ndocumented by sociologists and social psychologists (Gallagher 1994;\nGordon 1995a; Williams 1997). Gordon developed an account of the\ninvisibility of black subjectivity, in which black people become\nmirrors or empty hulls, mere projections of white needs and desires.\nWhite affection for black people is similar to their affection for\ntheir pets, he argued, based on the fact that pets do not judge their\nmasters. Black people who go against these expectations to assert their\nsubjectivity and capacity to judge are subject to violence and erasure.\nGordon used a phenomenological approach not only to reveal white\nsupremacist attitudes, but also to analyze various black responses to\nanti-black racism, such as the use of the n-word as a means to deflate\nits power and divert its original meaning.\n",
