    "main_text": "\n\nPythagoreanism can be defined in a number of ways.\n\n(1) Pythagoreanism is the philosophy of the ancient Greek philosopher\n Pythagoras\n (ca. 570 \u2013 ca. 490 BCE), which prescribed a highly structured\nway of life and espoused the doctrine of metempsychosis\n(transmigration of the soul after death into a new body, human or\nanimal).\n\n(2) Pythagoreanism is the philosophy of a group of philosophers active\nin the fifth and the first half of the fourth century BCE, whom\nAristotle refers to as \u201cthe so-called Pythagoreans\u201d and to\nwhom Plato also refers. Aristotle\u2019s expression, \u201cso-called\nPythagoreans,\u201d suggests both that at his time this group of\nthinkers was commonly called Pythagoreans and, at the same time, calls\ninto question the actual connection between these thinkers and\nPythagoras himself. Aristotle ascribes no specific names to these\nPythagoreans, but the philosophy which he assigns to them is very\nsimilar to what is found in the fragments of\n Philolaus\n of Croton (ca. 470-ca. 390 BCE). Thus, Philolaus and his successor\nEurytus are likely to have been the most prominent of these\nPythagoreans. Philolaus posits limiters and unlimiteds as first\nprinciples and emphasizes the role of number in understanding the\ncosmos. Aristotle also identifies a distinct group of these so-called\nPythagoreans who formulated a set of basic principles known as the\ntable of opposites. Plato\u2019s sole reference to Pythagoreans cites\ntheir search for the numerical structure of contemporary music and is\nprobably an allusion to\n Archytas\n (ca. 420-ca. 350 BCE), who is the first great mathematician in the\nPythagorean tradition. Starting from the system of Philolaus he\ndeveloped his own sophisticated account of the world in terms of\nmathematical proportion.\n\n(3) Many other sixth-, fifth- and fourth-century thinkers are labeled\nPythagoreans in the Greek tradition after the fourth century BCE. By\nthe late fourth century CE many of the most prominent Greek\nphilosophers including Parmenides, Plato and Aristotle come to be\ncalled Pythagoreans, with no historical justification. There are\nnonetheless a number of thinkers of the fifth and fourth century BCE,\nwho can legitimately be called Pythagoreans, although often little is\nknown about them except their names. The most important of these\nfigures is Hippasus. What criterion should be used to identify an\nearly figure as a Pythagorean is controversial and there is debate\nabout individual cases. Fourth-century evidence shows that\nPythagoreanism gave an unusually large role to women for an ancient\nphilosophhical school. It is likely that the Pythagorean communities\nthat practiced a way of life that they traced back to Pythagoras died\nout in the middle of the fourth century BCE. \n\n(4) The last manifestation of Pythagoreanism, Neopythagoreanism, has\nbeen the most influential. Neopythagoreanism is not a unified school\nof thought but rather a tendency, stretching over many centuries, to\nview Pythagoras, with no historical justification, as the central and\noriginal figure in the whole Greek philosophical tradition. This\nPythagoras is often thought to have received his philosophy as a\ndivine revelation, which had been given even earlier to wise men of\nthe ancient Near East such as the Persian Magi, the Hebrews (Moses in\nparticular), and the Egyptian priests. All Greek philosophy after\nPythagoras, insofar as it may be true, is seen as derived from this\nrevelation. Thus, Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s ideas are viewed\nas derived from Pythagoras (with the mediation of other early\nPythagoreans). Many pseudepigrapha are produced in later times in\norder to provide the Pythagorean \u201coriginals\u201d on which\nPlato and Aristotle drew. Some strands of the Neopythagorean tradition\nemphasize Pythagoras as master metaphysician, who supposedly\noriginated what are, in fact, the principles of Plato\u2019s later\nmetaphysics, the one and the indefinite dyad. Other Neopythagoreans\ncelebrate Pythagoras as the founder of the quadrivium of\nmathematical sciences (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music),\nwhile still others portray him as a magician or as a religious expert\nand sage, upon whom we should model our lives. Neopythagoreanism\nprobably began already in the second half of the fourth century BCE\namong Plato\u2019s first successors in the Academy, but particularly\nflourished from the first century BCE until the end of antiquity.\nNeopythagoreanism has close connections to Middle and Neoplatonism and\nfrom the time of Iamblichus (4th c. CE) is largely absorbed into\nNeoplatonism. It was the Neopythagorean version of Pythagoreanism that\ndominated in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.\n",
