    "main_text": "Methodological Naturalism: Ny\u0101ya Epistemology\n4. Moral Naturalism: karma and ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\n\nMoral naturalism has two characteristic features: first, moral facts\nare considered to be natural facts; second, moral facts can causally\ninfluence the physical world as well as human experience. Both these\nfeatures are present in the moral theories of many of the classical\nsystems of Indian philosophy.\n\nThe doctrine of karma is a foundational thesis of Indian moral\nphilosophy. According to the doctrine of karma, every action gives\nrise to some consequence; a good act leads to good consequence and a\nbad act to bad consequence: every human agent has to reap the\nconsequences of his/ her actions. One is sure to be rewarded or\npunished for one\u2019s good or wrong deeds. A just moral scheme\nrequires that one should never suffer or enjoy the consequences of\nanother\u2019s action. The burden of moral responsibility for\none\u2019s deeds is thus to be borne by the individual. In spite of\nthis, most Indians believed and still believe that even if our present\nactions are causally necessitated by our past actions, our present\nactions can be free.\n\nThe validity of the doctrine, however, has often been doubted on\nempirical grounds. For, it is a common sight that saintly people\nsuffer in their life, while habitual wrongdoers enjoy happiness. To\naccount for such anomalies, a theory of rebirth is tagged to the\nkarma-doctrine. The logic is somewhat like this: since nothing comes\nfrom nothing, one must have done something good in the past, in this\nlife or some other life, if one is happy; and, on the other hand, if\none suffers then one must have done something wicked, if not in this\nlife then in some other previous life. Although, with the exception of\na few parapsychologists, nobody claims to have any scientific evidence\nfor rebirth, yet this is a rational justification of the belief in\nrebirth on the assumption that the universe is law-governed. The\noverarching law that the philosophers in India believed in was called\n\u1e5bta\u2014the principle of cosmic order or harmony that\n\u2018makes science possible, the world beautiful and the humans\nmoral\u2019. \u1e5ata is the principle underlying the\n\u2018finely-tuned universe\u2019, the transgression of which leads\nto sin. It represents the totality of physical and moral laws, which\neven the gods are bound to obey. The law of karma follows from\n\u1e5bta as the causal basis of the phenomenal world. God is\nconstrained so to act as to keep in view the accumulated karma of\nindividuals, yet to bear fruit.\n\nKarma is standardly divided into three types in Indian thought: (1)\nthat which has started to bear fruit (pr\u0101rabdha) and cannot be\ndiverted or stopped in the middle of its course; (2) that which is\nbeing performed now the consequence of which is being credited for\nfuture fruition (sa\u00f1c\u012byam\u0101na); and (3) that which has\nbeen accumulated but yet to start yielding results (sa\u00f1cita). A\nvery apt illustration available in the literature is that of an archer\nwith his quiver full of arrows. The arrow which has been shot by the\narcher is like the first type, the arrow that the archer holds in his\nhand in a state of readiness is like the second type, and the arrows\nin the quiver, yet unused, are like the third type. It is evident that\nthe explanation of human acts being provided by the law of karma is a\ncausal explanation. Perrett 1998, p. 73 comments that \u2018just as\ncausal principle exhorts us to keep seeking explanations for physical\noccurrences, so the karmic principle exhorts us to keep looking for\nexplanations for \u201cmoral\u201d events.\u2019\n\nThe M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka-s admit the doctrine of karma but\nsupports non-naturalism in moral context. They believe in two causal\nrealms \u2014 ritual and natural and according to them the ritual\norder is independent of the natural order. In fact the causal\nconnection that obtains between a ritual enjoined by the scripture and\nits result cannot be explained naturally, e.g., how the correct\nperformance of putre\u015b\u1e6di sacrifice fulfills one\u2019s\ndesire for a son is beyond natural and scientific explanation\n(Chatterjee 2016).\n\nNy\u0101ya thinkers seek to relate the principle of karma with the\natomistic conception of nature described above, but in doing so might\nappear to compromise their commitment of metaphysical naturalism.\nIndividuals can enjoy or suffer the consequences of their actions only\nduring their embodied existence in the world. Atoms, therefore,\ncombine to form such a world as individuals deserve because of their\npast deeds. When accumulated merits and demerits become ready for\nfruition, they can impart motion to atoms. To admit an unseen force as\na cause of atomic motion, identified with the accumulated merits and\ndemerits of individual beings, might seem to run against a commitment\nto naturalism. Yet the idea that there is unbroken chain of causal\nconnection within the empirical world spanning across different lives\nsituates the postulated \u2018unseen force\u2019 itself within the\nboundaries of the natural world. Mohanty (1992, p. 222) observes that\n\u2018if actions of the self and the moral forces\n(ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da) generated by actions account for empirical\nnature\u2019s manifestation or creation, then ultimately nature is\nboth natural and moral: the two order coincides.\u2019\n",
