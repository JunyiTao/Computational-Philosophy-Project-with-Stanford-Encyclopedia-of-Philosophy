    "main_text": "The Construction of Racial Identities || Racial Identities and Whiteness\n3.5 Racial Identities and Whiteness\n\nIf social identities are contextual in relation to social,\nhistorical and cultural elements, this extends to what it means to be\nwhite. Whiteness across the Americas and Europe varies, since not all\nbegan as settler states, and yet the unconscious habits and frameworks\ninculcated by white or light-skinned persons positioned as superior to\nall other groups can have some commonalities. No matter one\u2019s\nindividual political and moral commitments, a person from the dominant\ngroup will have common experiences across most of their contexts in\nlight of this feature of their social identity.\n\n In his essay, \u201cThe Souls of White Folks,\u201d Du Bois\nconsidered the effects of a perpetually reinforced idea of natural\nsuperiority and dominance on white subjectivity (Du Bois 1940\n[1986c]). His concern was the \u201cconditioned reflexes\u201d and\n\u201clong followed habits\u201d built into customs and folkways (Du\nBois 1940 [1986c], 679). The fact that the white poor and white\nworkers were promised well more than they ever received had a profound\neffect on their resentments as well as their illusions. Du Bois was\nalso interested in how a generic self-regard could be attached to such\nan insignificant fact as white skin color: what does it do to a man,\nhe asks, to believe that his skin entitles him to ownership of the\nworld? Du Bois claimed an epistemic advantage as a non-white person\nwho can discern the pathological identity complex that afflicts\nwhites. He describes himself as a non-foreigner who lives among them\nand can view them from an \u201cunusual vantage\u201d so that, as he\nput it, \u201cI see in and through them.\u201d (Du Bois 1910 [1986b,\n923]). This knowledge is terrifying for white people and animates their\nantipathy: no Emperor wants to share table with those who know he is\nnaked. The habitual practices that ensure white self-regard are\nlargely unconscious, Du Bois suggested, and whites often vigorously\nresist being made conscious of them.\n\n More recently Charles W. Mills used the concept of the\n\u201cepistemology of ignorance\u201d to describe habits of knowing\nthat the dominant consciously pursue in order to ensure that they can\nretain moral self-regard (Mills 1997). Ignorance of the reality of\nracial domination, and of its illegitimacy, certainly requires more\nconcerted effort in the recent period. One must consciously avoid\ncertain books, courses, films, television shows, newspaper articles,\nand so on, but one must also attach oneself to certain ideas about\nobjectivity, the irrelevance of genealogy in assessing a claim, and the\nabsoluteness of truth claims that obviate the need for self-reflection.\nJos\u00e9 Medina (2012) has developed this idea further to explore\nhow self-knowledge has been curiously circumscribed in mainstream\ntraditions of epistemology to exclude knowledge of others or knowledge\nof one\u2019s society. If we are what we are always in relation to\nothers, he argues, then knowledge of others, and of the social\nconditions we must all inhabit, is a necessary condition of\nself-knowledge.\n\nShannon Sullivan (2006) has explored the idea of unconscious habits\nof whiteness more broadly. Her work has developed some aspects of\npsychoanalytic theory and pragmatism to explore the common elements of\nwhite racial identity formation. This proves a fruitful way to consider\nhow racism can be effectively passed down across generations without\nconscious intent. Bodily posture toward a person of color who comes to\none\u2019s door can convey a whole array of ideas to children without\nneeding to be stated. Sullivan elaborates a host of sometimes\nunconscious assumptions in white ways of being, involving entitlement,\nfear, guilt, and other affective states. Sullivan has looked\nparticularly at \u201clived spatiality\u201d: the way in which\ndiverse groups live their spatiality and understand themselves in\nrelation to specific spaces. Given the \u201cownership\u201d idea\nattached to whiteness, and the historical practices of forming\nsettlements in foreign lands, a phenomenological approach to the\nracialization of lived spatiality can reveal sediments of assumed white\nprivilege that can affect such current issues as gentrification and the\nreemergence of white nationalism. Some of these habitual practices\ncommon to white subjectivity may be formulated as epistemically\npraiseworthy (for example, aspiring to colorblindness, ignoring\nhistory, or the motivation to \u201cdiscover\u201d unknown lands and\nmake one\u2019s mark upon the world).\n",
