    "main_text": "Deontological Justification\n5. Deontological Justification\n\nThere is one additional view that is often thought of as internalist\nin epistemology, namely the idea that the concept of justification is\na deontological concept. In saying this, what is meant is\nthat being epistemically justified in believing something is bound up\nwith, or to be analyzed in terms of, one's living up to one's\nintellectual duties or responsibilities. We can easily think of cases\nwhere justification and obligation seem to be closely connected. When\na scientist runs an elaborate experiment in the attempt to confirm\nsome hypothesis H, and she gathers more and more evidence\nthat tends to bear on and confirm H, we tend to suppose that\nshe has an intellectual duty or obligation to follow the evidence\nwherever it goes and to believe in accord with that evidence. She\nshould not tailor her beliefs, in other words, to non-evidential\nfactors such as her desire to believe something incompatible with\nH, or her emotional attachment to some proposition\nincompatible with H. Nor should one's religious or political\nbeliefs get in the way; one's intellectual duty is to follow the\nevidence and to believe in accord with it, even in cases where the\nevidence seems to overthrow a proposition one would dearly like to see\nconfirmed.\n\nOne may well wonder why the thesis that the concept of epistemic\njustification is deontological has any connection to internalism. That\nthe justification of a belief is a matter of living up to one's\nintellectual duties, after all, has no obvious bearing on\naccessibility to the justifiers for any given belief, nor to any\nspecial view as to the nature of those justifiers, such as may be\ngiven in mentalism. This question is addressed more fully below. At\nthis point what we can say is that the deontological concept of\njustification has some internalist component because it seems related\nto a kind of control over beliefs that the epistemic agent may be\nthought to have. If one is intellectually obligated to take on a\nbelief given one's evidence, then one must be capable of doing so.\nThis point is underwritten by the general principle that Ought\nimplies Can, i.e., one has an obligation to do action A\nonly if one can do A. If one has the ability to take on new\nbeliefs given one's evidence, then one has some form of control over\nbelief formation, a control that is lodged in the epistemic agent.\nThis is the sense of \u201cinternal\u201d ingredient in the\ndeontological conception of justification, and it is this that makes\nthat concept a species of epistemic internalism.\n\nIt is now easy to see what the corresponding form of externalism with\nrespect to the concept of justification would be. It would be an\naccount of that concept that steers completely clear of talk of\nintellectual duties or responsibilities, but instead analyzes the\nconcept of justification in some other way, perhaps in terms of degree\nof evidential support or in terms of being truth-conducive.\n",
