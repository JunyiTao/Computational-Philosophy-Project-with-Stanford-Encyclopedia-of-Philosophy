    "main_text": "\n\n\nThomas Reid held a direct realist theory of memory. Like his direct\nrealism about perception, Reid developed his account as an alternative\nto the model of the mind that he called \u2018the theory of\nideas.\u2019 On such a theory, mental operations such as perception\nand memory have mental states\u2014ideas or impressions\u2014as\ntheir direct objects. These mental states are understood as\nrepresentations that encode information about their causes. The mind\nis directed towards and reads off from these representations,\ninformation about extra-mental items. By contrast, Reid holds that the\ndirect objects of memory and perception are extra-mental. In the case\nof perception, the mind is directed to present material objects and\nproperties; in the case of memory, the mind is directed towards past\nevents to which the person was agent or witness. In other words,\naccording to Reid, when we remember, we do not recall previous\nexperiences. In memory, the mind is directed neither towards an idea\nexperienced previously nor towards an idea of a previous\nexperience. Rather, we recall events, experienced\npreviously.\n\n\nReid is interested in the notion of memory not only for its own sake\nbut also because of its conceptual connection to the notion of personal\nidentity. Reid criticizes Locke\u2019s theory of personal\nidentity for inferring a metaphysical hypothesis now called the Memory\nTheory from the conceptual connection between memory and personal\nidentity. On this theory, personal identity consists in\nmemory; sameness of memory is metaphysically necessary and sufficient\nfor sameness of persons. According to Reid, memory is neither necessary\nnor sufficient for personal identity, metaphysically speaking.\nIndeed, Reid holds that it is impossible to account for personal\nidentity in any terms other than itself. Personal identity is\nsimple and unanalyzable. Though memory is not the metaphysical ground\nof personal identity, according to Reid, it provides first-personal\nevidence of personal identity. I know that I was present at my\ngraduation because I remember being there. Memories do not\nmake one the same person over time. Rather, memories\nallow one to know one\u2019s own past, immediately and directly.\n",
