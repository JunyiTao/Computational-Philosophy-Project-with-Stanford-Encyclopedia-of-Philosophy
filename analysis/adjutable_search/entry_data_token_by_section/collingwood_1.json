    "main_text": "Metaphilosophy || Philosophical distinctions and the overlap of classes\n2.1 Philosophical distinctions and the overlap of classes\n\nCollingwood\u2019s first mature work, An Essay on Philosophical\nMethod (1933), is a substantial treatise in metaphilosophy which\nseeks to delineate the subject matter and method of philosophical\nanalysis. Here Collingwood says that the true work of philosophy is\n\u201cthe distinguishing of concepts \u2026coexisting in their\ninstances\u201d (EPM 2005: 51). The moral philosopher, for example,\ndistinguishes between different kinds of good: the pleasant, the\nexpedient, and the right (EPM 2005: 41). When philosophers distinguish\nbetween the pleasant, the expedient, and the right as species of the\ngood they are not sorting things into mutually exclusive classes. If\nthis were their goal then the philosophical distinction between the\npleasant, the expedient, and the right would imply that\n\n\nwhatever is pleasant must therefore be both inexpedient and wrong;\nthat whatever is expedient must be both wrong and unpleasant, and that\nwhatever is right must be both unpleasant and inexpedient. (EPM 2005:\n41)\n\n\nBut this is clearly not the case because philosophers allow that one\nand the same action may be brought under different descriptions\ndepending on whether it is motivated by desire (the pursuit of\npleasure), by self-interest (expediency) or by duty (the right).\nBecause philosophical distinctions bring objects under different\ndescriptions rather than sorting them into classes, they defy the\nrules which apply to the relation between genera and species in the\ntraditional theory of classification (EPM: 31). In the traditional\ntheory of classification, the adjacent species of a genus tend to be\nmutually exclusive. Natural history, for example, classifies organisms\ninto animals and vegetables, animals into vertebrates and\ninvertebrates, vertebrates into mammals, birds, reptiles, and so on.\nThese adjacent species tend to capture mutually exclusive classes (the\nclass of vertebrates is different from the class of invertebrates; the\nclass of animals is different from the class of vegetables). While\nthere may be some overlap between adjacent species in this type of\nclassification (the platypus is an animal that suckles its young like\na mammal and lies eggs like a bird) these cases are \u201cexceptional\nand limited\u201d (EPM: 30). Overlap of classes, on the other hand,\nis a \u201cregular\u201d feature of philosophical distinctions.\n(EPM: 36). Philosophical distinctions allow for complete not\nmerely partial overlap. It is not merely the case, for example, that\nsome actions may exemplify both the concept of expediency and that of\nthe right (in the way in which the platypus is both a mammal and a\nbird or amphibians are both aquatic and terrestrial animals), but that\nin principle any action which falls under one species of a\nphilosophical genus could also fall under its adjacent concept: the\nclass of actions which instantiate the principle of expediency could\ntherefore in principle be the very same as the class of actions which\ninstantiate the principle of duty. Collingwood\u2019s point when\nclaiming that the concepts of expediency and duty overlap goes beyond\nthe epistemic consideration that it is difficult to know a\nperson\u2019s motive in acting, whether they were motivated by duty\nor by expediency; his point is rather that a philosophical distinction\nis \u201ca distinction without a difference, that is, a distinction\nin the concepts without a difference in the instances\u201d (EPM:\n50). To say that philosophical distinctions are \u201cdistinctions\nwithout a difference\u201d is not derogatively to dismiss them as\ninsignificant pedantic distinctions, but to point out that\nphilosophically to disambiguate concepts is not the same activity as\nsorting things into classes. To disambiguate the concept of love from\nthat of jealousy, (not Collingwood\u2019s example) is not the same as\nsorting partners into the separate classes of loving and jealous ones.\nBy the same token to disambiguate the conception of the good into the\npleasant, the expedient, and the right is not the same as sorting\nactions into those performed in the pursuit of pleasure,\nself-interest, or duty. The distinction between the pleasant, the\nexpedient, and the right, (as with the distinction between love and\njealousy) is a distinction that philosophers would want to make even\nif the world were such that actions motivated by duty necessarily\nbenefitted the agent so that the class of actions motivated by\nself-interest or by duty would contain the very same members.\nPhilosophical distinctions are purely intensional distinctions to\nwhich there may correspond no difference in the class of objects\nfalling under the concepts that philosophical analysis\ndisambiguates.\n\nConcepts, Collingwood says, may be viewed from two perspectives, their\nextension and their intension. From the point of view of their\nextension a concept is \u201cgeneral\u201d in so far as it gathers\nunder itself \u201cthe plurality of its individual instances\u201d.\nFrom the point of view of their intension a concept is generic in so\nfar as it gathers \u201cthe plurality of its specific\ndifferentiations\u201d:\n\n\nThus the concept of colour unites all the individual colours of all\nindividual coloured things into a class of which they are members; but\nit also unites the specific colours red, orange, yellow, green, and so\nforth into a genus of which they are the species. It may be convenient\nto refer to the former unification by saying that the concept is\ngeneral, to the latter by saying that it is generic. (EPM 2005:\n28\u201329)\n\n\nIn the traditional doctrine of classification intensional distinctions\npiggyback on extensional ones:\n\n\nThe logical doctrine of classification, as it stands in the ordinary\ntext-books, implies a certain definite connexion between these two\ncharacteristics of the concept: namely that if a genus is\ndistinguished into a certain number of species, the class of its\ninstances can be correspondingly divided into an equal number of\nsub-classes. Each sub-class will comprise the instances of one\nspecific concept; the totality of the sub-classes will comprise that\nof the generic concept\u2026 (EPM 2005: 29)\n\n\nPhilosophical distinctions do not follow this logic because they do\nnot presuppose that the concepts the philosopher disambiguates capture\na specific set or class. The task of philosophical analysis precisely\nis to distinguish concepts which coincide in their instances. When two\nphilosophical concepts coincide in their instances the thing which\nexemplifies them is not a hybrid, as amphibians or the platypus are.\nIt is one thing seen from different perspective or brought under\ndifferent descriptions. So, for example, a song exemplifies the\nconcepts of music and poetry, but to say this is not the same as\nsaying that it is part music and part poetry in the way in which a\ncentaur is part man and part horse or the platypus is part mammal and\npart oviparous. Aesthetic distinctions between poetry and music, like\nmoral ones, are distinctions which bring the whole of the object, not\na part of it, under a different description. Philosophical\ndistinctions are purely intensional distinctions between distinct\nconcepts or genera. But they are not for this reason inconsequential.\nJust as those who fail to disambiguate the concept of love from that\nof jealousy will be not be able to comprehend how a loving partner\nneed not be jealous so those who fail to disambiguate the concept of\nthe good will not be able to comprehend how the pursuit of what is\nmorally right may not be in one\u2019s self-interest.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s account of the nature of overlap of classes in\nphilosophical distinctions informs his philosophy of mind and his\napproach to the question concerning the nature of the relation holding\nbetween the mind and the body. The distinction between the concept of\nmind and the concept of body (or matter) is a philosophical\ndistinction. The task of the philosopher of mind is to distinguish\nbetween concepts which coincide in their instances and to disambiguate\nwhat one means, for example, when speaking about the human being\nqua biological being and qua person. When\nphilosophers so distinguish between mind and body, they do not do this\nin the manner of natural scientists who sort animals into the classes\nof mammals and oviparous. Minded beings are not hybrids who are part\nmind and part body in the way in which the minotaur is part man and\npart horse:\n\n\nMan\u2019s body and man\u2019s mind are not two different things,\nbut the same thing\u2026 as known in two different ways. Not a part\nof man, but the whole of man is body in so far as he approaches the\nproblem of self-knowledge by the methods of natural science. Not a\npart of man, but the whole of man is mind, in so far as he approaches\nthe problem of self-knowledge by expanding and clarifying the data of\nreflection. (NL 1992: 11)\n\n\nThe philosophical distinction between the concepts of mind and body is\nnot to be confused with a real or metaphysical distinction as argued\nby Descartes. The claim that mind is a sui generis concept or category\nthat is distinct from that of the body does not entail that it could\nexist apart from the body. Philosophical distinctions are intensional\ndistinctions with no deep ontological implications. But the fact that\nthey are not meant to cut reality at the joints does not mean that\nthey do not carry any weight: those who fail to make the distinction\nbetween the concepts of mind and body are bound to fail to see a\ndistinction between the normative/rationalizing explanations of\nactions and the descriptive/nomological explanation of events and\nespouse the view that the mind can be studied and understood in the\nsame way as matter, by invoking causal laws. It is no surprise,\ntherefore, that much of Collingwood\u2019s later philosophy, his\nphilosophy of history in particular, is devoted to defending the\nautonomy of the explanatory practices of history (which he took to be\nthe science of mind) from those of natural science. Distinguishing the\nexplanandum of history, i.e., (mind), from that of science\n(matter/nature) is the true task of philosophy, a task that, for\nCollingwood, has to be distinguished from what he takes to be the\npseudo problem of an enquiry into the causal relation holding between\nthe mind and the body. The true question concerning the relation\nbetween the mind and the body\n\n\n\u2026 is the relation between the sciences of the body, or natural\nsciences, and the sciences of the mind; that is the relation enquiry\ninto which ought to be substituted for the make-believe inquiry into\nthe make-believe problem of \u201cthe relation between body and\nmind\u201d. (NL 1992: 2.49/11)\n\n\nAn implication of the ubiquitous nature of the overlap of classes is\nthat the justification for the employment of philosophical concepts\ncannot be based on empirical observation because philosophical\ndistinctions cannot be empirically verified. A geologist\u2019s\nclassification of rocks into sedimentary and crystalline, for example,\nis based on the observable features of the two types of rocks and is\nempirically verifiable; by contrast philosophical distinctions such as\nthose between the expedient and the right, mind and body, cannot be\nsimilarly justified precisely because they are distinctions in the\nconcepts without differentiation in the instances. The justification\nfor the deployment of philosophical concepts and distinctions lies in\nthe fact that they enable us to bring reality under different\ndescriptions and view it from different angles, that they enable one,\nfor example, to judge a work of art to be aesthetically beautiful and\nyet morally reprehensible.\n\nIn his later philosophy Collingwood will abandon the terminology of\nthe overlap of classes, but the commitment to the view that\nphilosophical distinctions are \u201cdistinctions without a\ndifference\u201d, and that the task of philosophical analysis is to\ndistinguish between concepts which coincide in their instances remains\neven after this terminology is left behind. In his second\nmetaphilosophical treatise An Essay on Metaphysics (1940) he\nsets out to disambiguate the different senses of the term\n\u201ccause\u201d. The term cause can be used, in what he refers to\nas sense I to mean \u201creason\u201d or \u201cmotive\u201d. In\nsense I\n\n\nthat which is caused is the free and deliberate act of a conscious and\nresponsible agent, and causing him to do it means affording him a\nmotive for so doing. (EM 1998: 285)\n\n\nThis is the way in which the term is used in the historical sciences\nor sciences of the mind. The term \u201ccause\u201d is also used in\nwhat he refers to as sense II to denote an antecedent condition that\nagents have the power to produce or prevent. In this sense a cause\nis\n\n\nan event or state of things by producing or preventing which we can\nproduce or prevent that whose cause it is said to be. (EM 1998:\n296\u20137)\n\n\nThe term cause is used in sense II in the practical sciences of\nnature, sciences such as medicine and engineering. Finally, the term\ncause is also employed in sense III in the theoretical sciences of\nnature where\n\n\nthat which is caused is an event or state of things and its cause is\nanother event or state of things such that (a) if the cause happens or\nexists, the effect must happen or exist even if no further conditions\nare fulfilled (b) the effect cannot happen or exist unless the cause\nhappens or exists. (EM 1998: 285\u201386)\n\n\nThe main difference between sense II and sense III of the term is that\nwhereas in the practical sciences of nature the cause of an event is\nan antecedent state of affairs considered from the point of view of an\ninterest in controlling and manipulating the natural environment, in\nthe theoretical sciences of nature the causes of natural events are\nviewed independently of any impact that agents can have on the natural\nenvironment: a cause in sense III is unconditional. The key difference\nbetween sense I, on the one hand, and sense II and III on the other,\nis that in sense II and III a cause is an antecedent condition,\nwhereas in sense I it is a logical ground. When one explains an\nagent\u2019s intention in acting by ascribing the agent a motive or\nreason, the action is explained not by invoking something that went on\nbefore (an antecedent condition in the form of an inner psychological\nprocess) but the motive which rationalises it. Conflating sense I with\neither sense II or III is to conflate normative/rationalizing with\ncausal explanations thereby also failing to grasp the distinction\nbetween their respective explananda: actions and events. The\ndistinction between the different senses of causation, like the\ndistinction between the expedient and the right, is not a distinction\nbetween separate classes of things; it is a distinction between\nconcepts that may coincide in their instances.\n",
