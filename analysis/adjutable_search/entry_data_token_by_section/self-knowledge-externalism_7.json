    "main_text": "Slow Switching Arguments\n3. Slow Switching Arguments\n\nWe have explored one argument against the joint truth of EXT and SK,\nnamely, the reductio to armchair knowledge of the world. But there is\na further group of arguments to the same incompatibilist end. Such\narguments rest on a different thought experiment, the \u201cslow\nswitching\u201d experiment, to bolster the incompatibility of EXT and\nSK. In brief, the new thought experiment suggests that under EXT,\nself-attributions of thought content are not sufficiently\ndiscriminating to vindicate SK.\n\nThe slow switch thought experiment again features Oscar on\nEarth\u2014yet this time, we suppose he is unwittingly\nswitched to Twin Earth (e.g., during his sleep by a secret\ngovernment operative) (Burge 1988, Boghossian 1989). Upon his arrival,\nhe then takes up his usual activities, being none the wiser. Now the\nexternalist\u2019s intuition is that although Oscar\u2019s use\nof\u2018water\u2019 on Twin Earth initially refers to water on\nEarth, over time it comes to denote XYZ. (The switch is thus a\n\u201cslow\u201d one.) After all, Oscar will acquire the habit of\nusing \u2018water\u2019 in the presence of XYZ, and of using\n\u2018water\u2019 to converse with Twin Earthians about the stuff.\nYet if \u2018water\u2019 changes its referent, then (by the earlier\nFrege-Carnap view) this signals a shift in intension or content. And\nthe change in content can occur without Oscar noticing. Indeed it\nseems Oscar cannot detect the switch just from the\narmchair.\n\nWhat this indicates is that Oscar is unable to discriminate from the\narmchair whether assertions using \u2018water\u2019 have a water\ncontent versus a twin water content. As with the original Twin Earth\nexample, the lesson here is extended to mental content as\nwell. Hence, if a \u201cwater thought\u201d is one that Oscar\nexpresses with help from the term \u2018water\u2019, the slow switch\nexperiment indicates that:\n\nOscar cannot discriminate from the armchair that his water thought\nhas a water content rather than a twin water content.\n\n\nHis inability to discriminate, moreover, seems pertinent to SK. As\nBurge (1988, p. 653) puts it, (A) can easily suggest that SK is false\nin Oscar\u2019s case, i.e.:\n\nOscar cannot know from the armchair what content his water thought\nhas.\n\n\nGeneralizing from this, (B) suggests that SK ends up false if EXT is\ntrue.\n\nIn section\n 3.1,\n we shall see that Burge denies that (A) entails (B). Yet in light of\nhis resistance, Boghossian (1989) formulates a different version of\nthe slow switch argument. This second version, known as the memory\nargument, runs as follows. As before, suppose Oscar unwittingly\nis subject to a slow-switch, so that the concept he expresses with\n\u2018water\u2019 at t1 denotes water, and the\nconcept he expresses at t2 denotes twin water. Then,\nif p is a thought that Oscar uses \u2018water\u2019 in\nexpressing, the memory argument runs as follows (adapted from Ludlow\n1993a):\n\nIf Oscar forgets nothing, then what Oscar knows at\nt1, Oscar knows at t2.\nOscar forgot nothing.\nOscar does not know at t2 that he thinks\np. \nSo, Oscar does not know at t1 that he thinks\np. [from (a)-(c)]\n\n\nPremise (a) is seen as a platitude about memory (though some deny\nthis; see section\n 3.3).\n Premise (b) is regarded as stipulative, and premise (c) is thought to\nbe the lesson of the slow switch experiment. The thinking behind (c)\nis this: Even if Oscar knows his water thoughts at\nt1, yet these morph into twin water thoughts at\nt2, he no longer knows at t2 about\nany water thoughts. For Oscar no longer has water\nthoughts at t2.\n\nThere are further variations on these slow switch arguments.\nWhat\u2019s more, there ends up being multiple interpretations of the\ninitial thought experiment. (See the supplementary document,\n Variations on Slow Switching,\n for more details.) Nonetheless, all variations embody the same basic\nthought: If EXT is true, then in a slow switch Oscar cannot\ndistinguish from the armchair a water content from a twin content.\nThis then forms the basis for why EXT precludes SK. Given the two\ntypes of slow switch argument, note that sections\n 3.3\n addresses only the second type, the memory argument. The remaining\nsections, however, plausibly have some bearing on both types of\nargument.\n",
