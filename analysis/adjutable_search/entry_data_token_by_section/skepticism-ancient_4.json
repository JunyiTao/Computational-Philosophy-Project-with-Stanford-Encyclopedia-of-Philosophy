    "main_text": "Academic Skepticism || Arcesilaus\n3.1 Arcesilaus\n\nWith Arcesilaus (316/5\u2013241/0 BCE) and his role as leader of the\nAcademy (266/268 BCE), Plato\u2019s Academy turns skeptical.\nArcesilaus does not refer to himself as a skeptic\u2014this\nnomenclature is a later designation. However, Arcesilaus stands at the\nbeginning of a re-orientation in the history of Platonically inspired\nphilosophy. He rediscovers Socrates the examiner, arguably based on\nhis reading of Plato\u2019s dialogues (Thorsrud 2018).\nSocrates\u2019 commitment to investigation, to the testing and\nexploring of one\u2019s own and others\u2019 beliefs, and his\npassion for weeding out falsehoods, are the starting-points of his\nAcademic skepticism (Cicero, Acad. 2.74, 1.46). Throughout\nthe history of this skeptical school, these traits, and the\ncorresponding commitment to a life guided by reason, remain alive\n(Cooper 2004b, Vogt 2013). When, as we shall see below, Arcesilaus\ndefends a skeptical life without belief, this is because, as he\nthinks, reason itself, if properly and faithfully followed, leads us\nto live that way. To Arcesilaus, the skeptical life is a life lived\nfollowing reason, a life based on reason\u2014just as the\ncompeting Stoic and Epicurean lives are alleged by their proponents to\nbe. Arcesilaus engages with the epistemologies of these contemporaries\nof his. In particular, the Academics call into question that there is\na criterion of truth, as both Epicureans and Stoics, beginning in the\ngeneration before Arcesilaus, claim there is. One interpretive\nquestion that concerns Arcesilaus, but also later Academic skeptics,\nis especially vexed. According to Seneca (Letter 88,\n44), the Academics paradoxically claim to know that nothing can be\nknown. Scholars disagree on how this and similar reports fit together\nwith the picture of Academic skeptics as open-minded inquirers (Allen\n2017). According to Sextus Empiricus, the Academics skeptics say that\neverything is inapprehensible (PH 1.226, cf. PH 1.3). Is\n\u201ceverything is inapprehensible\u201d the single thing that can\nbe apprehended? Does so-called \u201cnon-apprehension\u201d\n(akatal\u00eapsia) amount to the general claim that there is\nno knowledge? Alternatively, the Academics may dialectically\nappeal to the Stoic notion of katal\u00eapsis, and argue\nmerely that the Stoic notion of apprehension is not compelling (Allen\n2022).\n\nLike Socrates, Arcesilaus did not write anything. His views must be\nunearthed from Sextus\u2019 comparisons between Pyrrhonian and\nAcademic skepticism, from Cicero\u2019s discussions in the\nAcademica, and from a range of shorter (and sometimes\nhostile) reports. Major themes in Arcesilaus\u2019 philosophy are (i)\nhis dialectical method, (ii) discussion of whether there is a\ncriterion of truth, and (iii) his defense of the skeptic\u2019s\nability to act.\n\n(i) Method. Arcesilaus embraces what scholars call a dialectical\nmethod (Couissin 1929 [1983], Perin 2013, Thorsrud 2018). This method\nis inspired by Socrates. It proceeds by asking one\u2019s real or\nimaginary interlocutor what they think about a given question, then\nplunging into an examination of their views, employing their premises.\nCan they explain their position without running into inconsistencies,\nand without having to accept implications that they want to resist? As\na consequence of this method, it sometimes appears as if a skeptic,\nwhile examining someone\u2019s view and its consequences, makes a\npositive claim: \u201cso, such-and-such is not so-and-so.\u201d\nHowever, within a dialectical exchange, this should be read as\n\u201caccording to your premises, such-and-such\nfollows.\u201d This method remains a key ingredient of Greek\nskepticism. While the different skeptical schools develop variants of\nthe dialectical method, skeptical argument is often characterized by\nthe fact that skeptics think of themselves as engaging with\n\u201cdogmatic\u201d interlocutors. In the skeptical tradition, as\narticulated for example by Sextus Empiricus (see section 4.4.),\n\u201cdogmatists\u201d are philosophers who put forward, and defend,\npositive answers to philosophical questions about reality, knowledge,\nethical values, etc. They need not do so dogmatically or rigidly or\nwithout consideration of alternatives in order to count, in skeptical\nterms, as \u201cdogmatists.\u201d\n\n(ii) The Criterion of Truth. Zeno, the founder of Stoicism, and\nroughly 20\u201330 years Arcesilaus\u2019 senior, was for a time a\nstudent at the Academy. He was still in the Academy when he formulated\nkey Stoic doctrines. Like Arcesilaus, he claims Socratic ancestry.\nZeno is inspired by some of the same ideas that inspire the skeptics.\nIn particular, he engages with the Socratic idea that knowledge is\nintegral to virtue. Contrary to Arcesilaus, Zeno aims to give accounts\nof knowledge and virtue, and holds them up as ideals that human nature\npermits us to achieve. For him, knowledge is very difficult to attain,\nbut ultimately within the reach of human beings. From the point of\nview of Arcesilaus, Zeno\u2019s claim to Socratic heritage is almost\noffensive: Zeno seems to be too optimistic about our cognitive powers\nto be following Socrates (Frede 1983). Scholars have traditionally\nenvisaged an exchange of arguments between Zeno and Arcesilaus, where\neach modified his views in the light of the other\u2019s criticism.\nHowever, Zeno most likely formulated his views between 300\u2013275,\nand Arcesilaus argued against him c. 275 to 240, when Zeno (who died\nc. 263) was probably already retired (Brittain 2006, xiii; Alesse\n2000, 115 f.; Long 2006, ch. 5).\n\nThe core of the dispute between Arcesilaus and the early Stoics\nconcerns the question of whether there is a criterion of truth. The\nnotion of a criterion is introduced into Hellenistic discussions by\nEpicurus, who speaks about the kan\u00f4n (literally\nmeasuring stick) and krit\u00earion. For Epicurus, a\ncriterion is that evident thing, viz., the content of a\nsense-perception, against which claims about the non-evident are\ntested. For example, physics advances claims about non-evident things,\nsuch as atoms and void. These are not accessible to the senses, and\naccordingly, do not count as evident. Perception rules out various\nphysical theories. For example, a physical or metaphysical theory\naccording to which there is no movement can be dismissed because it is\nin disagreement with the evident.\n\nZeno argues that a certain kind of impression\u2014namely a cognitive\nimpression (phantasia\nkatal\u00eaptik\u00ea)\u2014is the criterion of truth (cf.\nShogry 2018). Zeno\u2019s conception of cognition\n(katal\u00eapsis, literally grasping, apprehension), and the\nrelated notion of a cognitive impression, aim to solve an\nepistemological problem. Belief-formation aims at the truth; there is\na norm inherent in the practice of believing that one should only\nbelieve truths. It is not transparent to us, however, which of our\nbeliefs, or claims to the effect that such-and-such is true, are\nsuccessful in their aim and hit the truth. Zeno argues that some\nimpressions are cognitive. A number of Stoic definitions of the\ncognitive impression, formulated by Zeno and his successors, are\ntransmitted.  Scholars approach them in at least three ways. First,\nsome scholars consider one of the Stoic definitions (SE M 7.247\u201352) as\ncanonical (Nawar 2014, Shogry 2018). Two, scholars at times examine\nspecific exchanges between Stoics and skeptics in the assumption that\nsome clauses in Stoic definitions respond to skeptic objections (for\nexample, Nawar 2017). Three, scholars have also pointed out that, here\nas elsewhere, the Stoics offer a multitude of definitions, without\nprivileging one of them as \u201cthe\u201d definition; different\ndefinitions may speak to different dialectical contexts or theoretical\nfoci (Vogt 2022).\n\nWith some simplification, a cognitive impression reveals its content\nand that it is kataleptic (cf. Cicero, Academica\n2.77\u20138). For example, when I look at my computer screen\nwhile typing this, I may very well have a cognitive impression that\nthis is my computer screen. When I look up and out of the window, I\nhave an impression of a friend walking across campus that is probably\nnon-cognitive. This impression might be true. But since I see her from\nsuch a distance, it is pretty surely not cognitive. That is, not all\ntrue impressions are cognitive, but all cognitive impressions are\ntrue. We should only assent to cognitive impressions, and so in\nforming our beliefs, hold only those certified beliefs (cf. Brittain\n2014 on the Stoic view that assent to cognitive impressions is not\ncompelled).\n\nArcesilaus calls into question whether there are impressions of this\nkind. His main point seems to be that there could be an impression\nthat is phenomenologically indistinguishable from cognitive\nimpressions, but nevertheless misrepresents the matters it gives an\nimpression about. To use an example that may derive from Carneades\n(see section 3.2), there is no impression of a given egg such that no\nimpression of any other egg could be phenomenologically\nindistinguishable from it (Shogry 2018 and 2021, Machek and Veres\nforthcoming). Assuming that some clauses in Stoic definitions respond\nto specific skeptic challenges, the following clause, added to a\nshorter definition, appears to speak to these cases: \u201cand\nof such a kind as could not arise from what is not\u201d\n(Long and Sedley (1987) [= LS] 40; DL 7.46, 54; Cicero Acad.\n1.40\u20131, 2.77\u20138; SE M 7.247\u201352). Absent a\ncriterion of truth, Arcesilaus\u2019 skeptic suspends judgment about\neverything (PH 1.232). Reason itself, Arcesilaus thinks,\ndemands such suspension.\n\n(iii) Action. If skeptics suspend judgment, argues their dogmatic\nopponent, they are not able to act. Stoic philosophy conceives of\nthree movements of the mind: impression, assent, and impulse\n(Plutarch, Col. 1122a-d). All three figure in action. The\nagent assents to the impression that A is to be done; their\nassent is an impulse for the action A; if there is no\nexternal impediment, the impulse sets off the action (Inwood 1985). It\nis a cornerstone of Stoic philosophy that there can be no action\nwithout assent, and so without the belief that the action done is\nto be done. The Stoics aim to avoid the kind of determinism\naccording to which actions are not \u2018up to\u2019 the agent\n(Bobzien 1998); for them, assent, but not impression, is up to the\nagent. In response to the Apraxia Charge, Arcesilaus seems to have\nargued that the skeptic can act without having assented (Plutarch,\nCol. 1122A-d), and so without believing that the action done\nis to be done. However, this is not his complete response.\nFrom the point of view of the Stoics, skeptical action, if performed\nwithout the relevant kind of assent (that is, assent that it is up to\nthe agent to give, and that is a rational acceptance of the\nimpression), is like the action of a non-rational animal, or like the\nautomatic movement of plants when they grow and flourish. Arcesilaus\nis robbing people of their minds (Cicero Acad. 2.37\u20139;\nObdrzalek 2013). But Arcesilaus need not and does not go so far as to\ncompare human agents with non-rational agents. As human beings,\nskeptics have rational impressions. They perceive the world\nconceptually, and think about it. Arcesilaus does not suggest that\nskeptical action is causally set off by impressions, or in the way,\nwhatever that is, that animal actions are set off. This would be a\nproblematic proposal, for it would disregard that the skeptic has a\nhuman mind. Given the complexity of human thought, the skeptic is\nlikely to have several, and often competing impressions. If all\nimpressions triggered impulses, the skeptic would be inactive due to a\nkind of paralysis. The second component of Arcesilaus\u2019 reply,\nthus, is that the skeptic, in acting without assenting, adheres to the\nreasonable (eulogon) (SE M 7.158; 7.150; Striker\n2010). That is, Arcesilaus aims to explain skeptic action as rational\nagency (Cooper 2004b). Arcesilaus disputes the dogmatic claim that\nsome impressions can be identified as true, and the related claim that\none can only act on the belief that some impression is true.\nBut he does not argue that there are no differences between\nimpressions which agents could take into account. His agents are\nrational: they think about their options, and go with what looks, in\none way or another, more plausible.\n\nArcesilaus defends skeptical action also against Epicurean critics\n(Plutarch, Col. 1122A-d), again by showing on the basis of\nthe Epicureans\u2019 own premises that skeptical action is possible.\nCan the sceptic explain why, when leaving a room, they go through the\ndoor rather than running into the wall? Arcesilaus seems to have\nexploited the Epicurean view that, while all sense-perception is true,\nbelief can introduce falsehood. Like the Epicurean, the skeptic can\nkeep apart the perception and a view formed on its basis. By not\nassenting to the perception, thus adding belief (\u201chere is the\ndoor\u201d), the skeptic guards against the source of falsehood,\nnamely belief. But a skeptic has perception of the door available to\nthem, which is enough for not running into walls.\n",
