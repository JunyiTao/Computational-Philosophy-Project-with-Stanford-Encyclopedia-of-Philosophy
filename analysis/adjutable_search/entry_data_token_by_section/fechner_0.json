    "main_text": "A Divided Soul\n1. A Divided Soul\n\nGustav Theodor Fechner (1801\u20131887) is one of the most enigmatic\nthinkers of nineteenth century German philosophy. His intellectual\nsoul was fractured, torn into two deeply divided halves, each of which\nclaimed dominance over the other. His entire career was an attempt to\nunite these warring sides. But, despite his best efforts, he never\nsucceeded. \n\nWhat were these halves? On the one hand, Fechner had deep positivist\nproclivities, which made him advocate the strictest standards of\nobservation and measurement in science, and which led him to adopt\nearly versions of phenomenalism and verificationism in philosophy. On\nthe other hand, Fechner also had a desperate longing for metaphysics,\nfor a complete vision of the entire cosmos, which his piecemeal\nscientific work could never satisfy. The problem facing him was\ndaunting: How to be both a cautious and sober scientist and a daring\nand imaginative metaphysician?\n\nThese two sides of Fechner represent conflicting currents of his age.\nGrowing up in the early nineteenth century, Fechner was exposed to the\nrise of romanticism and the growth of the empirical sciences. He was\nan early student of romantic Naturphilosophie, the writings\nof Schelling, Oken and Steffans, which were Faustian attempts to grasp\nnature as a whole. But he was also a student of physics and physiology\nat the University of Leipzig, where his mentors, Alfred Volkmann and\nErnst Weber, were at the forefront of experimental work on the\npsychology of perception. Fechner learned early that the speculative\nmethods of Naturphilosophie were insufficient to yield\ncareful and substantive results in science; despite that, he never\nlost the longing for unity, the desire for a complete vision of\nthings, which is characteristic of Naturphilosophie.\n\nEach side of Fechner\u2019s personality bore its characteristic\nfruit. The product of his positivist side was his early scientific\nwork on the psychology of perception, and his massive two volume work\nElemente der Psychophysik (1860), which attempts to describe\nin precise laws the relationship between the psychic and physical.\nBecause it stressed the dependence of the mental on its physical\nexpression and embodiment, Fechner\u2019s philosophy of mind has been\ndescribed as a form of materialism. The product of his metaphysical\nside is his so-called \u201cpanpsychism\u201d, the the doctrine that\nthe cosmos is psychic, that it is an embodiment of the psychic (for a\nmore precise definition of this term,\n see below, section 4).\n Fechner put forward this doctrine in his two most famous works:\nNanna oder \u00fcber das Seelenleben der Pflanzen (1848a) and\nZend-Avesta oder \u00fcber die Dinge des Himmels und des\nJenseits (1851). \n\nFechner\u2019s effort to harmonize the two sides of his nature came\nwith his inductive metaphysics, i.e., the attempt to reach\ngeneral metaphysical conclusions on the basis of the methods and\nresults of the empirical sciences. Like other philosophers of his\ngeneration, viz., Lotze, Trendelenburg and Hartmann, Fechner rejected\nthe synthetic methods of the German idealists (Fichte, Schelling,\nHegel), who attempted to derive their conclusions by a priori\nmethods. In his view, metaphysics should follow, not lead the\nempirical sciences, which are autonomous and stand on their own\nfoundation independent of philosophy. The crucial question was whether\ngeneral metaphysical principles really could be based on the empirical\nsciences, whose results are always piecemeal and tentative. \n\nAny attempt to understand Fechner must come to terms with both sides\nof his personality. We must do justice to his panpsychism as well as\nhis positivism. We can dismiss the panpsychism on positivist grounds,\nas many have done; but if we do that, we beg questions against\nFechner. He insisted that his conclusions are based on well-grounded\ninferences from facts of experience, and he pointed out (rightly) that\nresistance to his views was often based on little more than prejudice.\nFar from a reckless metaphysician, Fechner himself applied positivist\nstandards to his own metaphysics. We can dispute whether he met those\nstandards; but we can can do so only after a careful examination of\nhis argument. Even where his conclusions extend beyond the empirical\nevidence for them, they at least raise interesting questions and\npossibilities. Fechner\u2019s panpsychism raises the important\nquestion of the limits of consciousness: Is consciousness limited to\nhuman beings and animals? Or should we extend it to plants and indeed\nall organic beings?\n\nMany studies of Fechner are one-sided, emphasizing one side of him at\nthe expense of the other. Older scholarship tended to focus on his\nmetaphysical side, especially his panpsychism (see, for example,\nAdolph 1923; Bruchmann 1887; Pastor 1901a,b; Wille 1905; and Wentscher\n1924: 18\u201372). In reaction to such work, a more recent book by\nMichael Heidelberger finds \u201cthe heart of Fechner\u2019s\nphilosophy\u201d in his non-metaphysical side, and it stresses his\n\u201cnon-reductive materialism\u201d as the main achievement of his\nphilosophy (2004: 73\u201374). While Heidelberger\u2019s work is an\nimportant corrective to older scholarship, it still makes the same\nmistake: it too is one-sided. It is unconvincing because it\ndrastically underplays Fechner\u2019s panpsychism, which it simply\ndismisses as \u201cone of his most notorious ideas\u201d (2004: 3).\nThough odd by contemporary standards, panpsychism was Fechner\u2019s\ngeneral worldview, and its exposition and defense would preoccupy him\nfor much of his life. It is also deeply misleading to describe the\nheart of Fechner\u2019s philosophy as any form of materialism, even\nif it is a \u201cnon-reductive\u201d kind. Fechner not only had a\ndeep aversion to materialism, but he also insisted that belief in the\nexistence of matter is only the reification of an abstraction. There\nare indeed passages, which Heidelberger duly cites, where Fechner\ndescribes his philosophy as \u201cvery materialist\u201d; but in\nthose very same passages he also describes his philosophy as\n\u201cvery\n idealist\u201d.[1]\n\n\nThe chief purpose of this introductory article is to provide a brief\nsurvey of Fechner\u2019s most important philosophical\nwritings. No attempt is made to consider his writings on physics and\npsychology, which is the task for another article. The most important\nphilosophical writings are, in my opinion, Nanna,\nZend-Avesta and Ueber die physikalische und\nphilosophische\n Atomlehre.[2]\n These writings represent the two sides of Fechner\u2019s philosophy,\nthe metaphysical and positivist. There is also no attempt to provide\nan account of Fechner\u2019s Elemente der\nPsychophysik\u2014even though some contemporaries regarded it as\nhis most important work\u2014since its results are essentially\nempirical and have, on Fechner\u2019s own reading (see Fechner 1860:\nI, 6), little philosophical relevance. Because Fechner\u2019s\nphilosophy is incomprehensible without knowing about his life, this\narticle also includes two biographical sections, one on his early life\nand another on his mental breakdown. The latter section, though\nseemingly superfluous, is crucial because it is the source and\nmotivation for Fechner\u2019s mature philosophy. The article\nconcludes with a short analysis of Fechner\u2019s theory of mind,\nwhich is probably that aspect of his philosophy of most contemporary\ninterest. Finally,\n a supplement: \u201cDr. Mises\u2019 Merry Pranks\u201d\n contains a survey of Fechner\u2019s early pseudonymous writings,\nwhich should shed light on his philosophical development.\n",
