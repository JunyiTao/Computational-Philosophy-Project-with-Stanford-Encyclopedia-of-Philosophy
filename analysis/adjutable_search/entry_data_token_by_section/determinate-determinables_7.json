    "main_text": "Contemporary accounts of determinables and determinates\n3. Contemporary accounts of determinables and determinates\n\nWe turn now to canvassing contemporary accounts of determinables,\ndeterminates, and their relation. The main varieties of contemporary\nontological accounts include anti-realist accounts, on which\ndeterminables do not exist; reductive accounts, on which determinables\nexist but are metaphysically reducible to (that is, identical with)\nsome or other construction of determinates; and non-reductive\naccounts, on which determinables exist and are not metaphysically\nreducible to any construction of determinates. Non-reductive accounts\nfurthermore split into versions on which determinables are (always)\nless fundamental than associated determinates, and accounts on which\ndeterminables can be as fundamental as, or even more fundamental than,\ndeterminates; we reserve treatment of this further issue for\n \u00a74.\n A different sort of contemporary account is directed not so much at\nthe ontological question(s) as at elucidating certain structural or\nbroadly logical aspects of determination or associated relata.\n\nAs background for the ontological accounts to come, we start with a\nnumber of considerations commonly offered as providing prima facie\nsupport for taking determinables to exist, and to moreover be\nontologically irreducible to (again: not identical to any construction\nof) determinates. We then consider some preliminary motivations for\ndeflationary (anti-realist or reductive) treatments of determinables.\nOne might wonder whether the motivations for taking determinables to\nexist might be presented independently of the motivations for taking\ndeterminables to be irreducible; this proves difficult, however, for\nthere typically isn\u2019t enough daylight between the initial\nmotivations for existence and for irreducibility to prise them apart.\nThe presentation thus reflects that the motivations for reducibility\n(or for anti-realism) come later, as pushing against taking the prima\nfacie appearances of irreducible determinables at face value.\n",
