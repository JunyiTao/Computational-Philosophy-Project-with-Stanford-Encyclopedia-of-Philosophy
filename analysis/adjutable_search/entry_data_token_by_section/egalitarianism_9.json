    "main_text": "Equality of Condition: Equality of What? || Conclusion: A Test Case\n3.7 Conclusion: A Test Case\n\n\nPhilosophical discussions of what should be equalized if we care\nabout equality of condition raise dust that has not yet settled in any\nsort of consensus. All the rival views canvassed encounter\ndifficulties, the seriousness of which is at present hard to\ndiscern.\n\n\nIt should be noted that the issue, how to measure people's condition\nfor purposes of a theory of equality, connects to a broader issue, how\nto measure people's condition for purposes of a theory of fair\ndistribution. Equality is just one of the possible views that might be\ntaken as to what fair treatment requires. (For example, the\nsufficientarian and prioritarian principles discussed in the text below\nboth admit of resourcist and welfarist and \u201ccapabilitist\u201d\nvariants.) Any theory of distributive justice that says that sometimes\nbetter off persons should improve the situation of worse off persons\nrequires an account of the basis of interpersonal comparisons that\nenables us to determine who is better off and who is worse off.\n\n\nFinally, the reader might wish to test the merits of rival answers\nto the equality-of-what question by considering a social justice issue\ndifferent in character from the issues considered so far. Suppose a\nsociety is divided into two or more linguistic communities, one being\nby far the most populous. The language of the dominant community is the\nofficial language of public life, and a minority linguistic group\ndemands redress in the name of social equality. The minority group\nseeks government action to help sustain and promote the survival and\nflourishing of the minority linguistic community. For another example,\nsuppose a modern democratic society contains more or less intact\nremnants of hunter-gatherer bands who claim in the name of social\nequality the right to withdraw from the larger surrounding society and\npractice their traditional way of life and run their affairs\nautonomously. How should a society committed to an ideal of equality of\ncondition handle this type of issue? (See Kymlicka 1995, Young 1990,\nAnderson 1999, and Barry 2001.)\n",
