It was Prior\u2019s\n1956 John Locke lectures at Oxford and the ensuing book Time and\nModality (published in 1957) that brought Prior\u2019s\ndiscoveries in tense and modal logic before a wider audience. A number\nof logicians\u2014notably Thomas, Geach, Lemmon, Meredith and\nKripke\u2014took an immediate interest in Priorean modal logic, in\nparticular his Diodoran system and his system \\(Q\\), a multivalued\nlogic admitting the existence of contingent beings. Less immediate\nattention was paid to his tense logic. The bibliography of the subject\nin Prior\u2019s 1968 volume Papers on Time and Tense reveals\nthat up until 1965 the only publications in the field were either by\nPrior himself or were reviews of his work (chiefly of Time and\nModality). Yet a momentum was slowly gathering.\n\n\nAt a colloquium on modal and many-valued logics held in Helsinki, in\n1962, Hintikka proposed a tense-logical construal of his possible\nworlds semantics, maintaining that \u2018if we do not want to tie our\nlogic to old-fashioned physics, we are undoubtedly wiser if we \u2026\nno longer require that the alternativeness relation (in this case it\ncould perhaps be more appropriately termed \u201cfuturity\nrelation\u201d) effect a linear ordering\u2019 (1963: 76). Prior had\nhappily tied his 1954 \\(l\\)-relation to \u2018old-fashioned\nphysics\u2019: he later made it clear that he did not think much of\nthe view of time embodied in twentieth century physics (1996b:\n49\u201351).\n\n\nA pupil of von Wright, Hintikka had been stimulated by the\nlatter\u2019s proposals for the wide application of modal logic (see\nthe next Section) and had come to appreciate the possibility of\napplying modal notions to the study of the logic of time before he\nlearned of Prior\u2019s sophisticated work (through reading Time\nand Modality, which he reviewed in 1958). Hintikka was perhaps the\nfirst to stress the importance of a semantical approach to the tenses.\nDuring the early 1960s, he travelled regularly between Helsinki and\nCalifornia and his ideas on tense influenced a number of logicians\nworking in California, in particular Dana Scott.\n\n\n1962 was a significant year for tense logic. As well as\nHintikka\u2019s talk in Helsinki, Scott gave a lecture on tense logic\nin Amsterdam (Hans Kamp, then an undergraduate, was among his\naudience). Scott\u2019s work on tense logic was one aspect of his\nstudy of the semantics of natural language, which he pursued in close\ncollaboration with Richard Montague. Scott was aware of Prior\u2019s\nwork, and was also influenced in his understanding of tense by\nReichenbach\u2019s 1947 analysis (the latter was a powerful figure at\nUCLA until his death in 1953). Prior himself was critical of\nReichenbach\u2019s analysis of the tenses, describing it as having\nbeen \u2018in some ways a hindrance rather than a help to the\nconstruction of a logic of tenses\u2019 (Prior 1967a: 13).\nScott\u2019s work in tense logic was different in style from\nPrior\u2019s. He established the completeness and decidability of\nvarious axiomatic tense logics, and also showed that the temporal\npredicate logic of the reals is non-axiomatisable. His work in tense\nlogic is widely cited but remains unpublished. Prior learned of\nScott\u2019s work in January 1964, in a letter from Lemmon (who the\nprevious year had left Oxford for Claremont, near Los Angeles).\n\n\nIn 1965 Prior visited California for several months, as Flint\nProfessor of Philosophy at UCLA. For the first time he found himself\namong a group of enthusiasts for tense logic. Shortly after the visit\nended he was to write: \u2018I suppose that California is the most\nlogically mature place in the world, and now that the logic of tenses\nis pursued so widely and so vigorously there, its raw pioneering days\ncan be considered over\u2019 (1967a: vi). When Prior arrived at UCLA,\nNino Cocchiarella was just completing a Ph.D. thesis on quantified\nmodal and tense logic, under Montague\u2019s supervision (\u2018Tense\nand Modal Logic: A Study in the Topology of Temporal Reference\u2019).\nCocchiarella\u2019s interest in the philosophy of time had initially\nbeen aroused by Reichenbach\u2019s work on space and time, but it was\nhis acquaintance with Prior\u2019s Time and Modality that\nswept him into tense-logical research. (Only later did he learn of\nScott\u2019s work.) Prior\u2019s visit also coincided with Hans\nKamp\u2019s arrival at UCLA as a graduate student. Kamp attended\nPrior\u2019s lectures on tense logic in his first semester and became\ndeeply interested in the subject. The lectures led more or less\ndirectly to the topic of Kamp\u2019s Ph.D. thesis, written under\nMontague\u2019s supervision and entitled \u2018On Tense Logic and the\nTheory of Order\u2019 (1968). In Kamp\u2019s work the development of\ntense logic achieved a new level of formal sophistication. Segerberg,\ntoo, had just arrived in California, to study under Scott at Stanford.\nSegerberg had become interested in tense logic in Finland in 1964, at a\nseries of summer seminars given by von Wright, who was independently\npursuing a tense logic arising from his study of the logic of action,\nand later shown to be equivalent to a system Prior had discussed in\nTime and Modality (Prior 1957: 23\u20134; see von Wright 1965 and\nSegerberg 1967, 1989).\n\n\nIn December 1965 Scott delivered his famous talk to the Hume Society\nat Stanford entitled \u2018The Logic of Tenses\u2019. A multilith of\nScott\u2019s handwritten notes for this talk has been circulating ever\nsince among tense logicians. Four days later Prior himself addressed\nthe Society, again on tense logic. It was in this fecund atmosphere\nthat Prior completed the manuscript of his book Past, Present and\nFuture, which remains to this day one of the most important\nreferences in the field.\n\n\nThe years 1965\u20137 saw the publication of work in tense logic by\n\u00c5qvist, Bull, Clifford, Cocchiarella, Garson, Geach, Hamblin,\nLuce, Makinson, Rescher, Segerberg, von Wright\u2014and, of course,\nPrior. In a little over a decade Prior\u2019s invention had become an\ninternationally pursued branch of logic.\n\n\nPrior always had a firm belief that his tense logic would one day find\nuseful applications in other disciplines (possibly in mathematical\nphysics, he thought). When the outside demand for tense logic did\ncome, it was from linguistics (via Montague\u2019s papers, especially\nhis 1970) and from computer science. An early and influential computer\nscience application was by Pnueli, who employed tense logic in formal\nreasoning about the behaviour of concurrent programs (Pnueli 1977).\nPnueli is sometimes mistakenly credited with having originated tense\nlogic, but in fact he first learned of it from the classic 1971 volume\nTemporal Logic by Rescher and Urquhart\n(\u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and Hasle 1995: 344)\u2014a book dedicated to\nPrior and which is an elegant introduction to his work. The citation\nfor Pnueli\u2019s 1996 A. M. Turing Award begins \u2018For seminal\nwork introducing temporal logic into computing\nscience\u2019. (Goldblatt 1987 surveys the connections between\ntemporal logic and computer science that were emerging during the\ndecade following Pnueli 1997.)\n\n\nPrior would not have been completely surprised to learn how useful\ntense logic has proved to be in computer science. He himself took\nlittle interest in computing, beyond including material on elementary\nboolean circuit theory in his undergraduate lectures, but a number of\nthe logicians with whom he was in touch were more deeply involved (Dov\nGabbay and Dana Scott, for instance). Through others Prior knew\nsomething of the potential. He wrote \u2018There are practical gains\nto be had from this study too, for example in the representation of\ntime-delay in computer circuits\u2019 (1996a: 46). In Past,\nPresent and Future he remarked concerning logics of discrete time\nthat their usefulness \u2018does not depend on any serious\nmetaphysical assumption that time is discrete; they are\napplicable in limited fields of discourse in which we are concerned\nonly with what happens next in a sequence of discrete states, e.g. in\nthe workings of a digital computer\u2019 (1967a: 67). Other logics\nfrom a wide group that Prior and von Wright pioneered are also finding\ncomputational applications, for example epistemic logic in artificial\nintelligence and knowledge-base engineering, and the logic of action in\nprogramming theory. It is pleasant to reflect that two major forces in\nthe genesis of these software technologies were Prior\u2019s love of\nancient and medieval logic and his concern to make conceptual room for\nfreedom of the human will.\n",
