    "main_text": "Theological Wrinkles || Free Will and God\u2019s Power, Knowledge, and Goodness\n4.1 Free Will and God\u2019s Power, Knowledge, and Goodness\n\nA large portion of Western philosophical work on free will has been\nwritten within an overarching theological framework, according to\nwhich God is the ultimate source, sustainer, and end of all else. Some\nof these thinkers draw the conclusion that God must be a sufficient,\nwholly determining cause for everything that happens; all of them\nsuppose that every creaturely act necessarily depends on the\nexplanatorily prior, cooperative activity of God. It is also commonly\npresumed by philosophical theists that human beings are free and\nresponsible (on pain of attributing evil in the world to God alone,\nand so impugning His perfect goodness). Hence, those who believe that\nGod is omni-determining typically are compatibilists with respect to\nfreedom and (in this case) theological determinism. Edwards (1754\n[1957]) is a good example. But those who suppose that God\u2019s\nsustaining activity (and special activity of conferring grace) is only\na necessary condition on the outcome of human free choices need to\ntell a more subtle story, on which omnipotent God\u2019s cooperative\nactivity can be (explanatorily) prior to a human choice and yet the\noutcome of that choice be settled only by the choice itself. For\nimportant medieval discussions\u2014the apex of philosophical\nreflection on theological concerns\u2014see the relevant portions of\nAl-Ghazali IP, Aquinas BW and Scotus QAM.\nThree positions (given in order of logical strength) on God\u2019s\nactivity vis-\u00e0-vis creaturely activity were variously defended\nby thinkers of this area: mere conservationism, concurrentism, and\noccasionalism. These positions turn on subtle distinctions, which have\nrecently been explored by Freddoso (1988), Kvanvig and McCann (1991),\nKoons (2002), Grant (2016 and 2019), and Judisch (2016).\n\nMany suppose that there is a challenge to human freedom stemming not\nonly from God\u2019s perfect power but also from his perfect\nknowledge. A standard argument for the incompatibility of free will\nand causal determinism has a close theological analogue. Recall van\nInwagen\u2019s influential formulation of the \u2018Consequence\nArgument\u2019:\n\n\nIf determinism is true, then our acts are the consequences of the laws\nof nature and events in the remote past. But it is not up to us what\nwent on before we were born, and neither is it up to us what the laws\nof nature are. Therefore, the consequences of these things (including\nour present acts) are not up to us. (van Inwagen 1983, 16)\n\n\nAnd now consider an argument that turns on God\u2019s comprehensive\nand infallible knowledge of the future:\n\n\nIf infallible divine foreknowledge is true, then our acts are the\n(logical) consequences of God\u2019s beliefs in the remote past.\n(Since God cannot get things wrong, his believing that\nsomething will be so entails that it will be so.) But it is not up to\nus what beliefs God had before we were born, and neither is it up to\nus that God\u2019s beliefs are necessarily true. Therefore, the\nconsequences of these things (including our present acts) are not up\nto us.\n\n\nAn excellent discussion of these arguments in tandem and attempts to\npoint to relevant disanalogies between causal determinism and\ninfallible foreknowledge may be found in the introduction to Fischer\n(1989). See also the entry on\n foreknowledge and free will.\n\n\nAnother issue concerns how knowledge of God, the ultimate Good, would\nimpact human freedom. Many philosophical theologians, especially the\nmedieval Aristotelians, were drawn to the idea that human beings\ncannot but will that which they take to be an unqualified good. (As\nnoted above, Duns Scotus is an exception to this consensus, as were\nOckham and Suarez subsequently, but their dissent is limited.) Hence,\nif there is an afterlife, in which humans \u2018see God face to\nface,\u2019 they will inevitably be drawn to Him. Following\nPascal, Murray (1993, 2002) argues that a good God would choose to\nmake His existence and character less than certain for human beings,\nfor the sake of preserving their freedom. (He will do so, the argument\ngoes, at least for a period of time in which human beings participate\nin their own character formation.) If it is a good for human beings\nthat they freely choose to respond in love to God and to act in\nobedience to His will, then God must maintain an \u2018epistemic\ndistance\u2019 from them lest they be overwhelmed by His goodness or\npower and respond out of necessity, rather than freedom. (See also the\nother essays in Howard-Snyder and Moser 2002.)\n\nIf it is true that God withholds our ability to be certain of his\nexistence for the sake of our freedom, then it is natural to conclude\nthat humans will lack freedom in heaven. And it is anyways common to\ntraditional Jewish, Christian, and Muslim theologies to maintain that\nhumans cannot sin in heaven. Even so, traditional Christian theology\nat least maintains that human persons in heaven are free. What sort of\nfreedom is in view here, and how does it relate to mundane freedom?\nTwo good recent discussions of these questions are Pawl and Timpe\n(2009) and Tamburro (2017).\n",
