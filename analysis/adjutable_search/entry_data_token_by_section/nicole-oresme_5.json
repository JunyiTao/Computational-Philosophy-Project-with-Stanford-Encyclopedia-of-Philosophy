Similarly, Oresme proves\nthe possibility of a plurality of worlds, but ultimately keeps to the\nAristotelian tenet of a single cosmos (Clagett 1974, 224\u2013225;\nHarvey 2011).\n\nOresme was a determined opponent of astrology, which he attacked on\nreligious and scientific grounds. In De proportionibus\nproportionum Oresme first examined raising rational numbers to\nrational powers before extending his work to include irrational\npowers. The results of both operations he termed irrational\nratios, although he considered the first type commensurable with\nrational numbers, and the latter not. His motivation for this study\nwas a suggestion of Thomas Bradwardine that the relationship between\nforces \\((F)\\), resistances \\((R)\\), and velocities \\((V)\\) is\nexponential (Grant 1966, 24\u201340; Clagett 1974, 224). In modern\nterms: \n\n\\[ \\frac{F_2}{R_2} = \\left( \\frac{F_1}{R_1} \\right)^{(V_2 /V_1)} \\]\n\n\nOresme then asserted that the ratio of any two celestial motions is\nprobably incommensurable (Grant 1971, 67\u201377). This excludes\nprecise predictions of successively repeating conjunctions,\noppositions, and other astronomical aspects, and he subsequently\nclaimed, in Ad pauca respicientes (its name derives from the\nopening sentence \u201cConcerning some matters \u2026\u201d), that\nastrology was thereby refuted (Grant 1966, 83\u2013111). In his\nLivre de divinacions and his Tractatus contra\nastronomos Oresme tries to show that astrology is \u201cmost\ndangerous to those of high estate, such as princes and lords to whom\nappertains the government of the commonwealth\u201d (Coopland 1952,\n51). As with astrology, he fought against the widespread belief in\noccult and \u201cmarvelous\u201d phenomena by explaining them in\nterms of natural causes. Oresme\u2019s writings against astrology and\nmagic were due to his concern over the king\u2019s and his\ncourt\u2019s addiction to these practices. Interestingly, in the\nfirst redaction of his Questions on Meteorology Oresme does not yet\nturn out to be the resolute opponent of astrology as we know him from\nhis later works, but, quite the contrary, adheres to its principles\n(Panzica 2021, 2).\n\nIn his De visione stellarum Oresme departs from the standard\nview of earlier authors in optics such as Ptolemy (2nd\ncentury), Ibn al-Haytham (965\u2013c. 1040), Roger Bacon (c.\n1214\u2013c. 1292), and Witelo (c. 1230/35\u2013after 1275), who all\nheld that refraction can only occur at the interface of two media of\ndiffering densities and thus would not take place in a single medium\nof uniformly varying density. He states \u2013 more than 300 years\nbefore Robert Hooke (1635\u20131703) and Newton \u2013 that\natmospheric refraction occurs along a curve and proposes to\napproximate the curved path of a ray of light in a medium of uniformly\nvarying density, in this case the atmosphere, by an infinite series of\nline segments each representing a single refraction (Burton 2007,\n33\u201364).\n\nIn the first redaction of his Commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Meteorology\nOresme stated the supralunar location of comets, a unique opinion for\na medieval philosopher (Kirschner 2000c; for the identification of the\nanonymous manuscript as Oresmian see Panziza 2015). Oresme\u2019s view of\nthe celestial nature of the Milky Way was also unconventional,\notherwise only held by Albert the Great and Henry of Langenstein.\n",
