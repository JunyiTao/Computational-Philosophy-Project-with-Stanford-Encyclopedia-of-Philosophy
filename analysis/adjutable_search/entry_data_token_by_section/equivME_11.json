First, as we have\nsuggested, some of the interpretations of mass-energy equivalence seem\nto assume implicitly certain features of matter. Second, some\nphilosophers and physicists, notably Einstein and Infeld (1938) and\nZahar (1989), have argued that mass-energy equivalence has\nconsequences concerning the nature of matter. In this\nsection, we will discuss the first of these two relationships between\n\\(E_o = mc^2\\) and hypotheses concerning the nature of matter. We\ndiscuss the second relationship in the next section\n (Section 2.5).\n\nTo explain how some interpretations of mass-energy equivalence rest on\nassumptions concerning the nature of matter, we need first to\nrecognize, as several authors have pointed out, e.g., Rindler (1977),\nStachel and Torretti (1982), and Mermin and Feigenbaum (1990), that\nthe relation one actually derives from the special relativity is:\n\n\n\\[\\tag{7}\nE_o = (m - q)c^2 + K,\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(K\\) is merely an additive factor that fixes the zero-point of\nenergy and is conventionally set to zero and \\(q\\) is also routinely\nset to zero. However, unlike the convention to set \\(K\\) to zero,\nsetting \\(q = 0\\) involves a hypothesis concerning the nature of\nmatter, because it rules out the possibility that there exists matter\nthat has mass but which is such that some of its mass can never be\n\u201cconverted\u201d into energy.\n\nThe same-property interpretation of mass-energy equivalence rests\nsquarely on the assumption that \\(q = 0\\). Mass and energy cannot be\nthe same property if there exists matter that has mass some of which\ncannot ever, under any conditions, be \u201cconverted\u201d into\nenergy. However, one could argue that although the same-property\ninterpretation makes this assumption, it is not an\nunjustified assumption. Currently, physicists do not have any\nevidence that there exists matter for which \\(q\\) is not equal to\nzero. Nevertheless, it seems important, from a philosophical point of\nview, to recognize that the same-property interpretation depends not\nonly on what one can derive from the postulates of special relativity,\nbut also on evidence from \u201coutside\u201d this theory.\n\nInterpretations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\) that hold that mass and energy are\ndistinct properties of physical systems need not, of course, assume\nthat \\(q\\) is different from zero. Such interpretations can simply\nleave the value of \\(q\\) to be determined empirically, for as we have\nseen such interpretations argue for treating mass and energy as\ndistinct properties on different grounds. Nevertheless, the\nBondi-Spurgin interpretation does seem to adopt implicitly a\nhypothesis concerning the nature of matter.\n\nAccording to Bondi and Spurgin, all purported conversions of mass and\nenergy are cases where one type of energy is transformed into another\nkind of energy. This in turn assumes that we can, in all cases,\nunderstand a reaction by examining the constituents of physical\nsystems. If we focus on reactions involving sub-atomic particles, for\nexample, Bondi and Spurgin seem to assume that we can always explain\nsuch reactions by examining the internal structure of sub-atomic\nparticles. However, if we ever find good evidence to support the view\nthat some particles have no internal structure, as it now\nseems to be the case with electrons for example, then we either have\nto give up the Bondi-Spurgin interpretation or use the interpretation\nitself to argue that such seemingly structureless particles actually\ndo contain an internal structure. Thus, it seems that the\nBondi-Spurgin interpretation assumes something like the infinite\ndivisibility of matter, which is clearly a hypothesis that lies\n\u201coutside\u201d special relativity.\n",
