    "main_text": "Can there be an explanatory framework for the question?\n3. Can there be an explanatory framework for the question?\n\nSome disagree with Peter van Inwagen\u2019s assumption that each\npossible world is as likely as any other (Kotzen 2013). There have\nbeen metaphysical systems that favor less populated worlds.\n\nIndeed, the original purveyor of possible worlds, Gottfried Leibniz,\npictured possible things as angling to become actual. The more a thing\ncompetes with other things, the more likely that there will be\nsomething that stops it from becoming real. The winners in\nLeibniz\u2019s struggle for existence are cooperative. They uniquely\nfit the niche formed by other things. This key hole into existence\nimplicitly conveys information about everything. The little bit that\nis not, tells us about all that there is.\n\nOn the one hand, this metaphysical bias in favor of simplicity is\nheartening because it suggests that the actual world is not too\ncomplex for human understanding. Scientists have penetrated deeply\ninto the physical world with principles that emphasize parsimony and\nuniformity: Ockham\u2019s razor, the least effort principle, the\nanthropic principle, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, Leibniz worried that the metaphysical bias for\nsimplicity, when driven to its logical conclusion, yields the\nembarrassing prediction that there is nothing. After all, an empty\nworld would be free of objects trying to elbow each other out. It is\nthe world that requires the least effort to produce (Just do nothing!)\nand sustain (Continue doing nothing!). So why is there something\nrather than nothing? Even if there were previously something, why is\nthere still something? Why is so much still going on? To\navoid an answer that assigns us a special position in history, we\nwould have to model the universe as a perpetual motion machine. \n\nWhen worried by the bias in favor of simplicity, Leibniz pictures each\nnominee for existence as in a limbo between being and non-being. The\nleast complicated election is for none of the nominees to win a post.\nAny other election is arbitrary. But this election is superfluous if\nthere are no degrees of being. Given that existence is discrete, there\nis no boundary between non-existent things and existent things. \n\nLeibniz\u2019s limbo illustrates an explanatory trap. To explain why\nsomething exists, we standardly appeal to the existence of something\nelse. There are mountain ranges on Earth because there are plates on\nits surface that slowly collide and crumple up against each other.\nThere are rings around Saturn because there is an immense quantity of\nrubble orbiting that planet. This pattern of explanation is not\npossible for \u2018Why is there something rather than\nnothing?\u2019. For instance, if we answer \u2018There is something\nbecause the Universal Designer wanted there to be something\u2019,\nthen our explanation takes for granted the existence of the Universal\nDesigner. Someone who poses the question in a comprehensive way will\nnot grant the existence of the Universal Designer as a starting\npoint.\n\nIf the explanation cannot begin with some entity, then it is hard to\nsee how any explanation is feasible. Some philosophers conclude\n\u2018Why is there something rather than nothing?\u2019 is\nunanswerable. They think the question stumps us by imposing an\nimpossible explanatory demand, namely, Deduce the existence of\nsomething without using any existential premises. Logicians\nshould feel no more ashamed of their inability to perform this\ndeduction than geometers should feel ashamed at being unable to square\nthe circle.\n\nDavid Hume offers a consolation prize: we might still be able to\nexplain the existence of each event even if it is impossible to\nexplain everything all together. Suppose that the universe is\npopulated with an infinite row of dominoes. The fall of each domino\ncan be explained by the fall of its predecessor.\n\nBut what is responsible for the arrangement to begin with? Why is\nthere anything in our domain of discourse? This kind of comprehensive\nquestioning has long been alleged to commit the fallacy of\ncomposition. Questions that can be asked of elements within a system\nneed not be questions that can be asked of the system itself. Taking a\nstep back to the bigger picture is fine. But when the philosopher\nsteps back to get the biggest picture, he loses his footing. According\nto Immanuel Kant, the fall is misgauged as deep inquiry. \n\nIn the twentieth century, Russell\u2019s set paradox raised another\nchallenge. If there is a set for every property, there should be a set\nthat contains all only those sets that do not contain themselves as a\nmember. But the existence of such a set would imply a contradiction.\nSo set theory needed to preclude this universal set. This raises\nconcern about other totalities. The universe is, well, universal. When\nthe monist says there is exactly one thing, he imposes an endogenous\ndemand on that thing (Do not be two things!) and an exogenous demand\non everything else (Do not exist!). This exogenous demand involves\nabsolute generality. Normally, quantification is restricted to a\ndomain of discourse. If this normal relativity is actually mandatory,\nwe cannot ask the question that the monist seeks to answer: How many\nthings are there? Any number, including zero, would require\nunrestricted quantification. \n\n\u2018How many things are there?\u2019 also seems viciously\nabstract. A sortal such as KITTEN tells us the nature of a thing,\nthereby supplying criteria for counting and persistence. THING is a\ndummy sortal. How many things do you have when you have a capped pen?\nThe question cannot be answered because you have not been given\ncriteria governing whether the cap and the pen count as separate\nobjects. All questions about existence must be relativized to sorts.\nConsequently, the question of why there is something rather than\nnothing is incomplete. Once we remedy the incompleteness with a\nsortal, the question will be answered by science.\n\nEmpiricists such as Hume deny that the existence of anything could be\nproved by reason alone. Rationalists have been more optimistic. Many\nhave offered a priori proofs of God\u2019s existence. Such a\nproof would double as an explanation of why there is something. If God\nexists, then something exists. After all, God is something.\n\nBut would God be the right sort of something? If we are only seeking\nan a priori proof of something (anything at all!),\nthen why not rest content with a mathematical demonstration that there\nexists an integer between a square and a cube? There must exist\nsuch an integer because 25 is a square and 27 is a cube and only one\ninteger can be between 25 and 27. Therefore, something exists.\nWhy does this come off as a mathematical joke?\n",
