    "main_text": "One Object or Two? || Identity between appearances and things in themselves\n5.1 Identity between appearances and things in themselves\n\nAs Henry Allison and others have pointed out, it is not clear that\nthere is any content to the question of whether an appearance is\nnumerically identical to a thing in itself, outside of moral\n contexts.[58]\n It is relatively clear that in the context of his moral philosophy,\nKant wants to assert that one and the same object, a rational agent,\ncan be considered as an appearance and as a thing in itself.\nConsidered as an appearance, a rational agent is subject to conditions\nof experience (space, time, and the categories). Considered as a thing\nin itself, a rational agent can at least consistently be thought of as\nfree (because independent of the deterministic causal order of space\nand time), while practical reason gives us warrant for positively\nasserting that the agent is free. Kant typically expresses this\nsolution to the problem of freedom and determinism in terms of the\nnumerical identity of the appearance of the agent and the agent as\nthing in itself (e.g., Ak. 5: 105, 114). Practical reason gives both\ncontent and warrant to the assertion of numerical identity:\ncontent, because the assertion of numerical identity means\nthat one and the same noumenal agent is the cause of and therefore\nresponsible for the actions of an empirical rational agent\nover time, and warrant, because this assumption of the unity\nof a noumenal agent over time is a presupposition of our ordinary\nmoral cognition of blame and praise. But neither of these seem to hold\nin the theoretical use of reason. It is not clear that within the\ntheoretical use of reason we can give any content to the\nclaim of the numerical identity (or distinctness) of appearances and\nthings in themselves, nor any warrant for asserting or denying\n it.[59]\n\nIn defense of the contentfulness of these identity claims, one might\nargue that the term \u201cappearance\u201d and \u201cthing in\nitself\u201d each has an extension, a set of objects, and the\nquestion of identity is perfectly well-formed: do these two sets have\na non-empty intersection? If so, at least one appearance is identical\nto a thing in itself. But this argument begs the question by assuming\nthat the question of whether the set of appearances and the set of\nthing in themselves has an intersection is itself well-formed; whether\nthis is the case is precisely what is at issue.\n\nWhile many interpreters (notably Adams 1997: 822) think that we can\nhave no warrant for asserting the identity or non-identity of\nappearances and things in themselves in general, and thus think the\nidentity/non-identity debate (at least in theoretical contexts)\nconcerns something about which Kant must be agnostic, there are those\nwho disagree (Stang 2014; cf. Walker 2010). In texts quoted earlier,\nKant claims that appearances would cease to exist if there were not\nminds to experience them. On the assumption that this is not true of\nthings in themselves, consider the following argument:\n\n(P1) \n For any x, if x is an appearance, x\nwould not exist if there were no minds to experience it.\n (P2) \n For any x, if x is a thing in itself,\nx would exist if there were no minds to experience it.\n (C) \n For any x, if x is an appearance, x is\nnot a thing in itself.\n\n\nThis argument purports to show that, since appearances and things in\nthemselves have different modal properties, they must be distinct.\nSince (P1) and (P2) are claims Kant makes in the context of his\ntheoretical philosophy, this argument provides warrant for denying\nidentity on purely theoretical grounds.\n",
