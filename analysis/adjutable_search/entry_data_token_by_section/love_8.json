    "main_text": "Emotion Views || Love as Emotion Proper\n5.1 Love as Emotion Proper\n\nAn emotion proper is a kind of\n\u201cevaluative-cum-motivational response to an object\u201d; what\ndoes this mean? Emotions are generally understood to have several\nobjects. The target of an emotion is that at which the\nemotion is directed: if I am afraid or angry at you, then you are the\ntarget. In responding to you with fear or anger, I am implicitly\nevaluating you in a particular way, and this evaluation\u2014called\nthe formal object\u2014is the kind of evaluation of the\ntarget that is distinctive of a particular emotion type. Thus, in\nfearing you, I implicitly evaluate you as somehow dangerous, whereas\nin being angry at you I implicitly evaluate you as somehow offensive.\nYet emotions are not merely evaluations of their targets; they in part\nmotivate us to behave in certain ways, both rationally (by motivating\naction to avoid the danger) and arationally (via certain\ncharacteristic expressions, such as slamming a door out of anger).\nMoreover, emotions are generally understood to involve a\nphenomenological component, though just how to understand the\ncharacteristic \u201cfeel\u201d of an emotion and its relation to\nthe evaluation and motivation is hotly disputed. Finally, emotions are\ntypically understood to be passions: responses that we feel imposed on\nus as if from the outside, rather than anything we actively do. (For\nmore on the philosophy of emotions, see entry on\n emotion.)\n\nWhat then are we saying when we say that love is an emotion proper?\nAccording to Brown (1987, p. 14), emotions as occurrent mental states\nare \u201cabnormal bodily changes caused by the agent\u2019s\nevaluation or appraisal of some object or situation that the agent\nbelieves to be of concern to him or her.\u201d He spells this out by\nsaying that in love, we \u201ccherish\u201d the person for having\n\u201ca particular complex of instantiated qualities\u201d that is\n\u201copen-ended\u201d so that we can continue to love the person\neven as she changes over time (pp. 106\u20137). These qualities,\nwhich include historical and relational qualities, are evaluated in\nlove as\n worthwhile.[12]\n All of this seems aimed at spelling out what love\u2019s formal\nobject is, a task that is fundamental to understanding love as an\nemotion proper. Thus, Brown seems to say that love\u2019s formal\nobject is just being worthwhile (or, given his examples, perhaps:\nworthwhile as a person), and he resists being any more specific than\nthis in order to preserve the open-endedness of love. Hamlyn (1989)\noffers a similar account, saying (p. 228):\n\nWith love the difficulty is to find anything of this kind [i.e., a\nformal object] which is uniquely appropriate to love. My thesis is\nthat there is nothing of this kind that must be so, and that this\ndifferentiates it and hate from the other emotions.\n\n\nHamlyn goes on to suggest that love and hate might be primordial\nemotions, a kind of positive or negative \u201cfeeling\ntowards,\u201d presupposed by all other\n emotions.[13]\n\nThe trouble with these accounts of love as an emotion proper is that\nthey provide too thin a conception of love. In Hamlyn\u2019s case,\nlove is conceived as a fairly generic pro-attitude, rather than as the\nspecific kind of distinctively personal attitude discussed\nhere. In Brown\u2019s case, spelling out the formal object of love as\nsimply being worthwhile (as a person) fails to distinguish love from\nother evaluative responses like admiration and respect. Part of the\nproblem seems to be the rather simple account of what an emotion is\nthat Brown and Hamlyn use as their starting point: if love is an\nemotion, then the understanding of what an emotion is must be enriched\nconsiderably to accommodate love. Yet it is not at all clear whether\nthe idea of an \u201cemotion proper\u201d can be adequately enriched\nso as to do so. As Pismenny & Prinz (2017) point out, love seems\nto be too varied both in its ground and in the sort of experience it\ninvolves to be capturable by a single emotion.\n",
