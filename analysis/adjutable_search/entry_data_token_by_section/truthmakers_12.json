    "main_text": "What Motivates the Doctrine of Truth-makers? || Truth Depends on Being\n3.2 Truth Depends on Being\n\nDoes this mean that we should join Bigelow in his retreat to\n(Truth Supervenes Upon Being) or step back with Lewis to\n(Subject Matter)? The problem is that these supervenience\nprinciples don\u2019t seem a satisfactory resting place either, not\nif our concern is to understand how true representations can touch\nupon an independent reality, i.e., something non-representational.\nFirst, it is familiar point that just appealing to a systematic\npattern of modal co-variation between truths and their subject\nmatters\u2014so that there is no difference in the former without a\ndifference in the latter\u2014doesn\u2019t provide us within any\ninsight into the underlying mechanism or mechanisms that sustains this\ndependency (Molnar 2000: 82\u20133; Heil 2003: 67; Daly 2005:\n97\u20138; Melia 2005: 82\u20133). Second, if possible worlds are\nconceived as maximal representations then these supervenience\nprinciples (understood in the idiom of possible worlds) fail to\narticulate what it is for a representation to touch upon being,\nsomething non-representational: \u201cFor the idea that every truth\ndepends on being is not the idea that every truth is\nentailed by propositions of a certain sort\u201d (Merricks\n2007: 86).\n\nA third reason for being unsatisfied with Lewis\u2019 (Subject\nMatter) is based upon the observation that the supervenience\ninvolved is symmetric. Just as there is no difference in the\ndistribution of truth-values amongst the body of propositions without\na reciprocating difference in their subject matter, there is no\ndifference in their subject matter without a difference in the\ndistribution of their truth-values (Armstrong 2004: 7\u20138). But we\nalso have the firm intuition that the truth or falsity of a\nproposition depends upon the state of the world in a way in which the\nstate of the world doesn\u2019t depend upon the proposition\u2019s\ntruth or falsity. This means that a supervenience principle like\n(Subject Matter) cannot be used to articulate the asymmetric\nway in which truth so depends upon being; for this, it is argued, we\nneed to rely upon a robust asymmetric notion of truth-making\n(Rodriguez-Pereyra 2005: 18\u201319). Bricker (2015: 180\u2013183)\nreplies on Lewis\u2019s behalf that the oft-heard complaint that\nsupervenience by itself is not a dependence or ontological priority\nrelation is besides the point. Rather, Bricker argues, the\nmetaphysical punch of Lewis\u2019s doctrine that truth supervenes\nupon being \u201chas little to do with the \u2018supervenience\npart\u2019 and everything to do with the \u2018being\u2019 part and\nthe conception of fundamentality that informs it\u201d, where by\n\u2018fundamental\u2019 Bricker means Lewis\u2019s theory of\nnatural properties and relations.\n\nBut is there really anything so problematic or mysterious about the\nasymmetric dependence of truth upon being that we need anything as\nheavy duty as truth-making or supervenience+naturalness to explain it?\nA number of proposals have been made for explaining the felt asymmetry\nin other terms. Horwich (1998: 105; 2008: 265\u201366) argues that\nasymmetric dependence of truth upon being arises from the fact that we\ncan deduce p from the proposition that p is true. But we\ncan equally deduce p from p is true so this fails to\nestablish an asymmetric dependence (K\u00fcnne 2003: 151\u201352;\nRodriguez-Pereyra 2005: 27). \n\nHornsby argues instead that there is explanatory asymmetry between its\nbeing the case that p and the proposition that p is\ntrue, because the latter requires more to be the case than the\nformer, (e.g.) that there are propositions (Hornsby 2005: 44). Dodd\nsuggests a cognate alternative: that the felt asymmetry of truth upon\nbeing arises from the fact that the identity of the proposition that p\nis partially determined by the worldly items it\u2019s about, so we\ncan\u2019t understand what is required for the proposition that p\nto be true without already having an understanding of what it is for\np to be the case (Dodd 2007: 398\u2013400).\n\nMacBride (2014) offers a purely semantic account of the felt asymmetry\nin terms of the interlocking mechanism of reference and satisfaction\nthat explains the truth of a proposition. Whilst we can deduce from\nthe truth of the proposition that p that p is the case,\nMacBride argues that we can\u2019t (ultimately) explain its being the\ncase that p in terms of the truth of the proposition that\np because its being the case that p is already assumed\nby the truth of that proposition, that is, has already performed a\nrole in the semantic mechanism whereby the truth-value is determined.\nBy contrast, MacBride continues, its being the case that p\nisn\u2019t determined by a semantic mechanism but by whatever worldly\nfactors, if any, that gave rise to p\u2019s being the case. Saenz\n(2018) replies that whilst reference and satisfaction may be used to\nexplain that propositions are true, they still \u201cdo not, in any\nsense, account for the world \u2018making it\u2019 [sic] that\npropositions are some way\u201d (a similar point is made by Mulligan\net al 1984: 288, see sec. 3.5 below for further discussion). But Saenz\nrisks begging the question by making the additional demand on the\ncharacter of the felt asymmetry of truth and being that it consists in\nmore than an asymmetric relationship between truth and being. Saenz\nholds that the felt asymmetry consists in the requirement that the\nworld makes propositions true but whether we need to appeal to the\nidea of the world making propositions true in the first place is the\npoint at issue. Finally, Liggins (2012) argues that the felt asymmetry\nbetween truth and being is best explained in terms of the asymmetry of\ngrounding, although, as we have seen, the asymmetry of grounding is\ncontested (see sec. 1.6 above for further discussion). \n",
