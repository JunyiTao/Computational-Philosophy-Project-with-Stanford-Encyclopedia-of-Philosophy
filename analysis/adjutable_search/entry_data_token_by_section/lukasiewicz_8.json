    "main_text": "Many-Valued Logic || More than Three Values\n5.3 More than Three Values\n\nOnce the spell of bivalence was broken, a natural next step was to\nconsider logic with more than three values. In 1922 \u0141ukasiewicz\nindicated how to give truth-tables for the standard connectives in\nsystems with finitely or infinitely many truth values, according to\nthe following principles, where the truth-values are numbers in the\ninterval [0,1]: \n\\[ \\begin{aligned}\n\\tval{Cpq} & = \\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if } \\tval{p} \\le \\tval{q} \\\\\n (1 - \\tval{p}) + \\tval{q}, & \\text{if } \\tval{p} \\gt \\tval{q} \n\\end{cases} \\\\\n \\tval{Np} & = 1 - \\tval{p} \n\\end{aligned} \\]\n\n\nIn proposing logics with infinitely many values, \u0141ukasiewicz was\nthus the inventor of what was much later (43 years later, to be exact)\nto be called \u2018fuzzy logic\u2019. Commenting on these systems in\n1930, \u0141ukasiewicz wrote\n\nit was clear to me from the outset that among all the many-valued\nsystems only two can claim any philosophical significance: the\nthree-valued one and the infinite-valued ones. For if values other\nthan \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d are interpreted as \u201cthe\npossible\u201d, only two cases can reasonably be distinguished:\neither one assumes that there are no variations in degrees of the\npossible and consequently arrives at the three-valued system; or one\nassumes the opposite, in which case it would be most natural to\nsuppose, as in the theory of probabilities, that there are infinitely\nmany degrees of possibility, which leads to the infinite-valued\npropositional calculus. I believe that the latter system is preferable\nto all others. Unfortunately this system has not yet been investigated\nsufficiently; in particular the relations of the infinite-valued\nsystem to the calculus of probabilities awaits further inquiry.\n(SW, 173)\n\n\nWe will discuss this philosophical attitude below.\n",
