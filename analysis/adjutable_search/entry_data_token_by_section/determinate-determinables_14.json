Are determinates metaphysically prior to determinables?\n\nIt is commonly assumed that determinables, if they exist, are less\nfundamental than determinates. Of course, this assumption is true on\nreductionist\n accounts;[37]\n but even those taking determinables to be irreducible to determinates\noften suppose that the latter are prior to the former. In this section\nwe canvass reasons for and against taking determinates to be\nmetaphysically prior to determinables.\n",
