The Finitary Point of View\n\nThe cornerstone of Hilbert\u2019s philosophy of mathematics, and the\nsubstantially new aspect of his foundational thought from\n 1922b\n onward, consisted in what he called the finitary standpoint. This\nmethodological standpoint consists in a restriction of mathematical\nthought to those objects which are \u201cintuitively present as\nimmediate experience prior to all thought,\u201d and to those\noperations on and methods of reasoning about such objects which do not\nrequire the introduction of abstract concepts, in particular, without\nappeal to completed infinite totalities.\n\nThere are several basic and interrelated issues in understanding\nHilbert\u2019s finitary standpoint:\n\nWhat are the objects of finitary reasoning?\nWhat are the finitarily meaningful propositions?\nWhat are the finitarily acceptable methods of construction and\nreasoning?\n\n",
