    "main_text": "Marriage and Oppression: Gender, Race, and Class || Feminist Approaches\n5.1 Feminist Approaches\n\nA major theme in feminist political philosophy has been the exclusion\nof the marital family from justice. Political philosophy has tended to\nrelegate family life to natural hierarchy or affection (Okin 1979,\n1989). Historically, this meant that the private sphere of marriage,\nto which women were confined, was also the zone of state\nnon-interference, so that what happened to women there was not subject\nto norms of justice. Gradually, law and political philosophy have come\nto recognize that equal rights and liberties should be upheld within\nthe private sphere as outside it, but many political philosophers\nstill resist applying principles of justice directly within the\nprivate sphere. However, feminists argue that gender-structured\nmarriage contributes to, or is even the mainstay of, women\u2019s\neconomic inequality and disempowerment, and that justice must\ntherefore regulate its terms\u2014even, perhaps, to the point of\ninterfering with voluntary marital relations (Okin 1989, Ferguson\n2016). At the same time, marriage has been a crucial site of socially\nvaluable care work, which often falls disproportionately on women, and\nrecent feminist work has focused on how the state can support that\nwork more equitably (Metz 2010, Bhandary 2018).\n\nAs noted above, one persistent rationale for excluding the family from\nnorms of justice is that its natural relations of affection and trust\nare superior to merely just relations and likely to be threatened by\nconstruing the family in terms of justice (Hegel 1821, \u00a775,\n\u00a7161A; Sandel 1982, 31\u201335). But abuse within marriage and\ninequality on dissolution are significant problems, the gravity of\nwhich should, according to critics, outweigh these finer virtues;\nrights within marriage protect spouses when affection fails (Waldron\n1988, Okin 1989). Moreover, it is not clear that affection and justice\nmust conflict; a commitment to treating one\u2019s spouse justly\ncould be part of marital love (Kleingeld 1998). Finally, marriage is\npart of the basic structure of society, and thus, at least within\nRawlsian liberalism, is subject to principles of justice. This does\nnot determine, however, how principles of justice should constrain\nmarriage; the default liberal presumption is that marriage, as a\nvoluntary association, should be ordered as spouses choose\u2014so\nlong as these choices do not lead to injustice (Rawls 1997, 792). We\nwill return to this below.\n\nMarriage is a focus of feminist concern due to its effects on\nwomen\u2019s life chances. Continuing disadvantage accruing to women\nin marriage has been widely documented, and in some feminist analyses,\nundergirds gender inequality (rival accounts place greater emphasis on\nsexual objectification or workplace discrimination). Wives, even those\nwho work full-time outside the home, perform more housework than\nhusbands\u2014this \u2018second shift\u2019 affecting their\nworkplace competitiveness. The social assignment of primary\nresponsibility for childcare to women, combined with the difficulty of\ncombining childcare with paid work, also undermine the workplace\ncompetitiveness of women with children (Okin 1989, Chapter 7). The\ngendered division of labor and the fact that \u2018women\u2019s\nwork\u2019 is less well-paid than men\u2019s together make it more\nlikely that married women, rather than their husbands, will downgrade\ntheir careers, choose part-time work, or stay home to facilitate\nchild-rearing or when the spouses\u2019 careers conflict. These\nchoices make women \u201cvulnerable by marriage\u201d: economic\ndependence, and dependence on marriage for benefits such as health\ninsurance, fosters power inequality and makes exit difficult, in turn\nfacilitating abuse (Okin 1989, Chapter 7, Narayan 1995, Card 1996,\nBrake 2016, Ferguson 2016).\n\nAs discussed in 4.2, rationales of equality or equal opportunity are\ngiven for addressing economic inequalities arising within marriage\nthrough divorce law (Okin 1989, Chapters 7 and 8; Shanley 2004,\n3\u201330, Rawls 1997, 787\u2013794). However, divorce law does not\naddress non-economic sources of power imbalances (such as gender role\nsocialization) within on-going marriages, nor does it address the\nsystemic way in which such inequalities arise. Equal opportunity seems\nto require changing social norms related to marriage in ways which\ndivorce law does not. First, the gendered division of labor within\nongoing marriages is costly for women (Kleingeld 1998). Second, power\nimbalances within marriage limit girls\u2019 expectations and teach\nchildren to accept gendered inequality (Okin 1989, Chapter 7, Okin\n1994). Third, anticipation of marriage affects women\u2019s\ninvestment in their earning ability before marriage (Okin 1989,\nChapter 7). (But for an argument that some hierarchy and inequality in\nmarriage is just, see Landau 2012.)\n\nSuch social norms could be addressed through education or through\nmedia campaigns promoting the equitable division of housework. Legal\nmeasures such as requiring all marital income to be held equally could\nencourage power equality within marriage (Okin 1989, Chapter 8).\nHowever, state interference in on-going marriages arguably conflicts\nwith spouses\u2019 liberties (Rawls 1997, 787\u2013794). This seems\nto raise a theoretical problem for liberal feminism. Recent liberal\nfeminist approaches to marriage focus on how a just law of marriage\ncan protect women\u2019s interests as well as supporting a fairer\ndistribution of care work, which often falls on women (Metz 2010,\nBrake 2012, Hartley and Watson 2012, Ferguson 2016, Bhandary 2018; see\nalso reform proposals in 4.4 above).\n\nWhile many feminists have focused on the reform of marriage, others\nhave argued for its abolition as a legal status (Metz 2010, Chambers\n2013, 2017). It is sometimes claimed that marriage is inherently\nstructured by sexist social norms, precluding the possibility of\nfeminist reform \u2014 and that marriage also reinforces stigma\nagainst the unmarried (Chambers 2017). On such views, abolishing\nmarriage is necessary to reshape social expectations and change\npatterns of choice accompanying it. For example, legal marriage may\nencourage women\u2019s economic dependence by enabling and providing\nincentives for it. Thus, the legal structure of marriage, in\ncombination with social norms, is taken to encourage choices which\ndisempower women relative to men. Moreover, legal recognition of\nmarriage itself endorses an ideal of a central, exclusive love\nrelationship which, on the views of some feminists, encourages women\nto make disadvantageous choices by inculcating an exaggerated\nvaluation of such relationships\u2014at the expense of women\u2019s\nother aspirations. Thus, in The Second Sex, feminist\nphilosopher Simone de Beauvoir (1908\u201386) identified the\nexpectations surrounding marriage as one of the primary means by which\nwomen are socialized into a femininity which, in her view, was\nlimiting: marriage \u201cis the destiny traditionally offered to\nwomen by society\u201d (de Beauvoir 1949 [1989], 425; see also Okin\n1989), leading women to focus on their attractiveness as\nmates\u2014and not on study, career, or other ambitions. For this\nreason, some feminists have rejected ideals of romantic, exclusive\nlove relationships, arguing that women should choose non-monogamy or\nlesbian separatism (Firestone 1970; see also Card 1996). The idea that\nmarriage is essentially tied to such an ideal of romantic love will\nrequire further examination in the next section.\n",
