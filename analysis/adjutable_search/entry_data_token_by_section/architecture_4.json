    "main_text": "What is Architecture? || Architecture and Essential Features\n2.2 Architecture and Essential Features\nA contrasting definitional approach suggests that, as a matter of\nreasoned judgment, we can attribute to architectural practice\u2014or\nto the domain of architectural objects\u2014core or even essential\nfeatures. A dominant reading of the Vitruvian tradition has it that\narchitecture embodies and is best understood through the three aspects\nof beauty, structural integrity, and utility. An essentialist variant\nsuggests that architects must observe all three aspects or that any\nstructure aspiring to architectural status features all three. Other\nprominent views advance a single aspect, generally function or form,\nas primary. Thus, functionalist architectural doctrine places function\nor utility at the heart of the architectural enterprise, with other\naspects of architecture subordinate thereto.\nA hard-line functional essentialist holds that, if a built\nstructure has no function, then it is not architecture. As a modest\ndissent, Graham (1989) proposes that such a structure is an\narchitectural work\u2014but a failure at such. One brand of\nmore radical rejection suggests that some architectural\nobjects\u2014perhaps including follies, memorials, or\nmonuments\u2014need have no function at all. As a competing\nessentialism, formalist architectural doctrine suggests that an object\nis architectural just in case it features forms proper to the\ndomain. A common interpretation says that forms proper to architecture\ncan be chosen off a stylistic menu (or combination of menus), leaving\narchitects great latitude while upholding the possibility of\ncontrasting, non-architectural forms (this is difficult to square,\nhowever, with some experimental architecture).\nIn weighting architecture\u2019s aspects as essential, core, or\nsome lesser status, a related question is whether one or another\naspect is primary or necessary to any of the others. As Graham notes\n(1989), the traditional question in architectural theory of whether\nform trumps or precedes function may be cast in such terms.\nAgainst these traditional brands of essentialism, two further kinds\nof doubt may be cast. First, it may be that the Vitruvian triad, or\nsome single aspect thereof, does not represent the right list\u2014we\nshould include either further aspects or different aspects\naltogether. Alternatives might include dimensions such as context,\nrelations among architectural objects, systemic features,\nsustainability, and psychological or social features. Some theorists\npropose other candidates as essential architectural aspects, including\nspace (Zevi 1978) or the organizing concept of the parti\n(Malo 1999).\nSecond, it may be that essentialism represents a false start.  On\none non-essentialist view, the nature of an architectural object is as\nwe experience it, a matter upon which we may agree but which depends\nin part on subjective perception and reception of, and interaction\nwith, the work (Scruton 1979/2013). This leaves open the possibility\nthat architecture has essential aspects but we simply don\u2019t\nexperience them as such. A more determined nominalist has it that\ndiversity among architectural objects is sufficient to quash the\nprospect that they share any essential aspects.\n",
