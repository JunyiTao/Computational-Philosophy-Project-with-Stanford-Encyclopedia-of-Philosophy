    "main_text": "The Good Person || Spectrum of Virtues\n3.2 Spectrum of Virtues\n\nWe can see, therefore, why educating for character has never been\nstraightforward. William Bennett pushes for the virtues of patriotism,\nloyalty, and national pride; Amy Gutmann wants to see toleration of\ndifference and mutual respect. Can a pacifist in a time of war be a\npatriot? Is the rebel a hero or simply a\n troublemaker?[10]\n Can idealized character types speak to all of our students and to the\nvariegated contexts in which they will find themselves?\n\nShould our teachers teach a prescribed morality, often closely linked\nto certain religious ideas and ideals? Should they teach a content\nonly of secular values related to democratic character? Or should they\nteach a form of values clarification in which children\u2019s moral\npositions are identified but not criticized?\n\nThese two approaches\u2014a prescribed moral content or values\nclarification\u2014appear to form the two ends of a character\neducation spectrum. At one end is the method of indoctrination of\nprescribed values and virtues, regardless of sacred or secular\norientation. But here some citizens will express concern about just\nwhose values are to be taught or, to some,\n imposed.[11]\n At the same time, some will see the inculcation of specified values\nand virtues as little more than teaching a \u201cmorality of\ncompliance\u201d (Nord, 2001, 144).\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum is values\n clarification,[12]\n but this seems to be a kind of moral relativism where everything goes\nbecause nothing can be ruled out. In values clarification there is no\nright or wrong value to hold. Indeed, teachers are supposed to be\nvalue neutral so as to avoid imposing values on their students and to\navoid damaging students\u2019 self-esteem. William Damon calls this\napproach \u201canything-goes constructivism\u201d (1996), for such a\nposition may leave the door open for students to approve racism,\nviolence, and \u201cmight makes right.\u201d\n\nIs there a middle of the spectrum that would not impose values or\nsimply clarify values? There is no middle path that can cut a swath\nthrough imposition on one side and clarification on the other. Perhaps\nthe closest we can get is to offer something like Gutmann\u2019s or\nGalston\u2019s teaching of critical thinking. Here students can think\nabout and think through what different moral situations require of\npersons. With fascists looking for hiding Jews, I lie; about my\nwife\u2019s new dress, I tell the truth (well, usually). Even\ncritical thinking, however, requires students to be critical about\nsomething. That is, we must presuppose the existence, if not prior\ninculcation, of some values about which to be critical.\n\nWhat we have, then, is not a spectrum but a sequence, a developmental\nsequence. Character education, from this perspective, begins with the\ninculcation in students of specific values. But at a later date\ncharacter education switches to teaching and using the skills of\ncritical thinking on the very values that have been inculcated.\n\nThis approach is in keeping with what William Damon, an expert on\ninnovative education and on intellectual and moral development, has\nobserved: \u201cThe capacity for constructive criticism is an\nessential requirement for civic engagement in a democratic society;\nbut in the course of intellectual development, this capacity must\nbuild upon a prior sympathetic understanding of that which is being\ncriticized\u201d (2001, 135).\n\nThe process, therefore, would consist of two phases, two developmental\nphases. Phase One is the indoctrination phase. Yet which values do we\ninculcate? Perhaps the easiest way to begin is to focus first on those\nbehaviors that all students must possess. In fact, without first\ninsisting that students \u201cbehave,\u201d it seems problematic\nwhether students could ever learn to think critically. Every school,\nin order to conduct the business of education, reinforces certain\nvalues and behaviors. Teachers demand that students sit in their\nseats; raise their hands before speaking; hand assignments in on time;\ndisplay sportsmanship on the athletic field; be punctual when coming\nto class; do not cheat on their tests or homework; refrain from\nattacking one another on the playground, in the hallways, or in the\nclassroom; be respectful of and polite to their elders (e.g.,\nteachers, staff, administrators, parents, visitors, police); and the\nlike. The teachers\u2019 commands, demands, manner of interacting\nwith the students, and own conformity to the regulations of the\nclassroom and school establish an ethos of behavior\u2014a way of\nconducting oneself within that institution. From the ethos come the\nrequisite virtues\u2014honesty, cooperation, civility, respect, and\nso\n on.[13]\n\nAnother set of values to inculcate at this early stage is that\nassociated with democracy. Here the lessons are more didactic than\nbehavioral. One point of civic education in a democracy is to raise\nfree and equal citizens who appreciate that they have both rights and\nresponsibilities. Students need to learn that they have freedoms, such\nas those found in Bill of Rights (press, assembly, worship, and the\nlike) in the U. S. Constitution. But they also need to learn that they\nhave responsibilities to their fellow citizens and to their country.\nThis requires teaching students to obey the law; not to interfere with\nthe rights of others; and to honor their country, its principles, and\nits values. Schools must teach those traits or virtues that conduce to\ndemocratic character: cooperation, honesty, toleration, and\nrespect.\n\nSo we inculcate in our students the values and virtues that our\nsociety honors as those that constitute good citizenship and good\ncharacter. But if we inculcate a love of justice, say, is it the\njustice found in our laws or an ideal justice that underlies all laws?\nObviously, this question will not arise in the minds of most, if any,\nfirst graders. As students mature and develop cognitively, however,\nsuch questions will arise. So a high-school student studying American\nHistory might well ask whether the Jim Crow laws found in the South\nwere just laws simply because they were the law. Or were they only\njust laws until they were discovered through argument to be unjust? Or\nwere they always unjust because they did not live up to some ideal\nconception of justice?\n\nThen we could introduce Phase Two of character education: education in\njudgment. Judgment is based on weighing and considering reasons and\nevidence for and against propositions. Judgment is a virtue that\nrelies upon practical wisdom; it is established as a habit through\npractice. Judgment, or thoughtfulness, was the master virtue for\nAristotle from whose exercise comes an appreciation for those other\nvirtues: honesty, cooperation, toleration, and respect.\n\nBecause young children have difficulty taking up multiple\nperspectives, as developmental psychologists tell us, thinking and\ndeliberating that require the consideration of multiple perspectives\nwould seem unsuitable for elementary-school children. Additionally,\nyoung children are far more reliant on the teacher\u2019s involvement\nin presenting problem situations in which the children\u2019s\nknowledge and skills can be applied and developed. R. S. Peters offers\nan important consideration in this regard:\n\nThe cardinal function of the teacher, in the early stages, is to get\nthe pupil on the inside of the form of thought or awareness with which\nhe is concerned. At a later stage, when the pupil has built into his\nmind both the concepts and the mode of exploration involved, the\ndifference between teacher and taught is obviously only one of degree.\nFor both are participating in the shared experience of exploring a\ncommon world (1966, 53).\n\n\nThe distinction between those moving into \u201cthe inside\u201d of\nreflective thinking and those already there may seem so vast as to be\na difference of kind, not degree. But the difference is always one of\ndegree. Elementary-school students have yet to develop the skills and\nknowledge, or have yet to gain the experience, to participate in\nphase- two procedures that require perspectivism.\n\nIn this two-phased civic education teachers inculcate specific virtues\nsuch as patriotism. But at a later stage this orientation toward\nsolidifying a conventional perspective gives way to one of critical\nthinking. The virtue of patriotism shifts from an indoctrinated\nfeeling of exaltation for the nation, whatever its actions and\nmotives, to a need to examine the nation\u2019s principles and\npractices to see whether those practices are in harmony with those\nprinciples. The first requires loyalty; the second, judgment. We teach\nthe first through pledges, salutes, and oaths; we teach the second\nthrough critical inquiry.\n\nHave we introduced a significant problem when we teach students to\njudge values, standards, and beliefs critically? Could this approach\nlead to students\u2019 contempt for authority and tradition? Students\nneed to see and hear that disagreement does not necessarily entail\ndisrespect. Thoughtful, decent people can disagree. To teach students\nthat those who disagree with us in a complicated situation like\nabortion or affirmative action are wrong or irresponsible or weak is\nto treat them unfairly. It also conveys the message that we think that\nwe are infallible and have nothing to learn from what others have to\nsay. Such positions undercut democracy.\n\nWould all parents approve of such a two-phased civic education? Would\nthey abide their children\u2019s possible questioning of their\nfamilies\u2019 values and religious views? Yet the response to such\nparental concerns must be the same as that to any authority figure:\nWhy do you think that you are always right? Aren\u2019t there times\nwhen parents can see that it is better to lie, maybe even to their\nchildren, than to tell the truth? This, however, presupposes that\nparents, or authority figures, are themselves willing to exercise\ncritical judgment on their own positions, values, and behaviors. This\npoint underscores the need to involve other social institutions and\npersons in character education.\n",
