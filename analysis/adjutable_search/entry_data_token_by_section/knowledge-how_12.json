    "main_text": "The Action Theory Argument and the Question of Joint Action\n5. The Action Theory Argument and the Question of Joint Action\n\nRyle is often interpreted as claiming that knowledge-how ascriptions\nare nothing more than ascriptions of an ability or a complex of\ndispositions to act in a skilled or intelligent manner (though see\nHornsby 2011: 82 and Waights Hickman 2019 for dissent). This\ninterpretation is based on passages in the Concept of Mind,\nsuch as the following:\n\n\nWhen a person is described by one or other of the intelligence\nepithets such as \u201cshrewd\u201d or \u201csilly\u201d,\n\u201cprudent\u201d or \u201cimprudent\u201d, the description\nimputes to him not the knowledge or ignorance of this or that truth,\nbut the ability, or inability, to do certain sorts of things. (Ryle\n1949: 27)\n\n\nEarly intellectualists argued that knowledge-how does not entail\nability (Ginet 1975; Stanley & Williamson 2001; Snowdon 2004). For\nexample, a pianist who lost their arms in a car accident may have lost\nher ability to play but still preserve her knowledge-how to play the\npiano (cf. Snowdon\u2019s 2004: 8 expert omelette maker); or a ski\ninstructor might know how to do a ski stunt and, according to Stanley\n& Williamson (2001), still fail to have the ability to do it. By\ncontrast, anti-intellectualists argue that it is important to\ndistinguish between knowing how to perform a task, which corresponds\nto a general ability, and being (actually and circumstantially) able\nto perform it (No\u00eb 2005; Glick 2012; Setiya 2012). So the pianist\nmight have both general ability as well as knowledge-how, though they\nlack circumstantial ability. By contrast, the ski instructor does not\nclearly have knowledge-how to perform the ski stunt themselves, while\nthey know how one, in general, can do it. Recent\nintellectualist views also take knowledge-how to go together with\nabilities (understood along Hawley\u2019s 2003 notion of\ncounterfactual success) and argue that rightly construed\nintellectualism can vindicate this connection (Pavese 2015b; Cath\n2020). \n\nYet, everybody agrees that while knowledge-how might entail ability,\nability is not sufficient for knowledge-how, as demonstrated by an\nexample from Hawley (2003):\n\n\nAnnoyance. Susie is attempting to annoy Joe; she\nthinks smoking will do the trick. Whenever she smokes, she\nunconsciously and inadvertently taps on her cigarette pack.\nUnbeknownst to Susie, Joe does not mind cigarette smoke, but finds her\ntapping obnoxious.\n\n\nSusie has the ability to annoy Joe, since she has the disposition to\nannoy Joe whenever she attempts to do so. But, intuitively, she does\nnot know how to annoy him. A natural explanation of this is that she\ncannot annoy him intentionally (for structurally similar\ncases, see Carr 1979, 1981 and Bengson, Moffett, & Wright 2009).\nPretty much all sides of the dispute agree on the following claim\n(Ryle 1949; Stanley & Williamson 2001; Hawley 2003; Hornsby 2004,\n2011; Stanley 2011b; Setiya 2012):\n\n\n(Knowledge-how/Intentionality): If S intentionally\n\u03a6s, S knows how to \u03a6.\n\n\nMany also endorse the biconditional (Knowledge-how/Ability\nIntentional) (Hawley 2003; Setiya 2012):\n\n\n(Knowledge-how/Ability Intentional): S has the ability\nto intentionally \u03a6 if and only if S knows how to \u03a6.\n\n\n\nNow, suppose that knowing how to \u03a6 does require the ability to\nintentionally perform \u03a6. If so, whether knowledge-how requires a\npropositional attitude depends on whether or not one can intentionally\n\u03a6 without having a propositional attitude about how to \u03a6. But\naccording to many influential views of intentional action,\nintentionally \u03a6-ing does require a propositional attitude, namely\na belief about how to \u03a6. In particular, intentionally \u03a6-ing\nrequires having an action plan, which is characterizable in terms of a\nbelief about how to perform \u03a6. For example, on Goldman\u2019s\n(1970) view, one intentionally \u03a6s when one has a plan to \u03a6,\nwhere a plan to \u03a6 is a belief that specifies the means to \u03a6\n(see, also, e.g., Harman 1976; Audi 1986; Bratman 1987; Velleman 1989;\nGinet 1990; Mele & Moser 1994; Gibbons 2001). From this, we\nget:\n\n\n(Intentionality/Belief): If S intentionally \u03a6s,\nthen there are some means \\(m_1\\), \u2026, \\(m_n\\) to \u03a6 such\nthat S truly believes that \\(m_1\\), \u2026, \\(m_n\\) are means\nfor oneself to \u03a6.\n\n\nSome intellectualists have argued on these bases that knowledge-how to\n\u03a6 requires at least a propositional attitude about the means to\n\u03a6 (Cath 2015b).\n\nBut is propositional knowledge of means to ends required for\nintentional action, over and above true belief? Gibbons (2001)\nprovides several examples to buttress the necessity of knowledge for\nintentional action. For example, one cannot plausibly intentionally\nwin a fair lottery , nor can one intentionally defuse a bomb if one\nunintentionally and fortuitously chooses the correct wire; in both\ncases, a plausible explanation for the lack of intentionality is that\nthe subjects does not have the relevant propositional knowledge about\nhow to accomplish those tasks. These cases buttress the claim that\nintentional action requires knowledge of the means to execute it:\n\n\n(Intentionality/Knowledge): If S intentionally \u03a6s,\nthen there are some means \\(m_1\\), \u2026, \\(m_n\\) to \u03a6 such\nthat s knows that \\(m_1\\), \u2026, \\(m_n\\) are means for oneself to\n\u03a6.\n\n\nWith these assumptions in the background, here is a non-linguistic\nargument for intellectualism. Start from\n(Knowledge-how/Intentionality): if S intentionally\n\u03a6s, S knows how to \u03a6. Furthermore, suppose that\n(Intentionality/Knowledge) is true so that the intentionality\nof an action is to be explained at least in part in terms of\npropositional knowledge. Then, by these two premises, we get that if\none intentionally \u03a6s, one both knows how to \u03a6 and one has\npropositional knowledge of the means to \u03a6:\n\n\n(Knowledge-how, Intentionality, Knowledge): If S\nintentionally \u03a6s, S both knows how to \u03a6 and for some\nmeans \\(m_1\\), \u2026, \\(m_n\\), S knows that means \\(m_1\\) ,\n\u2026, \\(m_n\\) are means for oneself to \u03a6.\n\n\nNow, according to standard formulations of intellectualism, one knows\nhow to \u03a6 only if, for some means m to \u03a6, one knows that\nm is a means for one to \u03a6:\n\n\n(Intellectualism about Knowledge-How): S knows how to\n\u03a6 is at least in part of a matter of knowing, for some means\nm to \u03a6, S knows that m is a means for oneself\nto \u03a6.\n\n\nSo, the argument from intentional action for intellectualism maintains\nthat the intellectualist picture provides the best explanation for why\n(Knowledge-How, Intentionality, Knowledge) should hold.\nAccording to this explanation, (Knowledge-How, Intentionality,\nKnowledge) is true not just because of a coincidental alignment\nof propositional knowledge and knowledge-how in intentional action.\nRather, its truth is grounded on the very nature of knowledge-how: one\nknows how to \u03a6 in virtue of knowing, for some means\nm to \u03a6, that m is a means for oneself to \u03a6. \n\nThe view that intentional action requires belief has been challenged\nfor the particular case of basic actions. Setiya (2012)\nobserves that one can perform a basic action of clenching one\u2019s\nfist without even having the belief that one can succeed at doing it.\nFor example, someone might have had a paralyzing injury, fail to\nbelieve they have healed, and still form the intention to clench their\nfist. Intellectualists might reply that, although that subject does\nnot believe that one will succeed, they might have a sufficiently high\ncredence and that credence can amount to knowledge too (Pavese 2020).\n(For other possible responses to the idea that intentional action\nrequires knowledge or belief, see Elzinga forthcoming).\n\nA further related question is how to think of knowledge-how in the\ncase of joint actions. When two agents act jointly towards a goal, as\nwhen they row a boat together, they responsively coordinate and\nmonitor each other\u2019s movements in ways that produce a joint\naction. What kind of knowledge-how is manifested by successful joint\naction? It must be possible for the agents to coordinate without each\nhaving to know the different ways in which each must act to achieve\ntheir common goals: you and I can jointly make risotto even if I do\nnot know how to season it and you do. Correspondingly, Birch (2019)\nsuggests that joint knowledge-how must be accounted for\ndistributively. If this is correct, then the agents can\njointly know how to do something without each having a belief\nabout how they jointly do it, but only in virtue of having a\ncollective, or group, belief about how to do it. (For more discussion\non group knowledge-how, see Palermos & Tollefsen 2018 and\nStrachan, Knoblich & Sebanz 2020)\n",
