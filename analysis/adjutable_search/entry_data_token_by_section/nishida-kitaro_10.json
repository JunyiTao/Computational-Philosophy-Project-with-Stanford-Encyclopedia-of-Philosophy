Political Theory: Religion, Culture, and Nations\n\n\nNishida\u2019s discussion of the absolute and the finite self does not\nneglect the notion of religion and its relation to culture and the\nnation-state. These themes already formed an integral part of his\ntheory of the historical world, but became all the more pressing in a\ntime of world war. The concern with death was perhaps as much a\npolitical as a personal matter for Nishida, whose health in 1945 was quickly\nfailing. In one respect, he distanced himself from his milieu, where\neveryday life was dominated by an authoritarian state. In his last completed essay, he focuses on\nthe individual in relation to an absolute that in no way is subject to\nan absolutist state. His notion of the essentiality of religion is\nremarkably individualistic, removed from all social contingencies. He\nlocates the core of religion in the heart of the individual: religious\nawareness arises in one\u2019s knowing one\u2019s own death.\n\n\nOn the other hand, Nishida recognizes that religion is a social and\ncultural phenomenon, and that the contemporary individual is a subject\nof a state. He seems however to reverse any implied priority of\nculture over religion and state over individual: it is because culture\nis religious in its core that we find religion in every culture; and\nobedience to the nation must be based on true religious awareness. To\nbe sure, writing under a totalitarian government in 1945, Nishida\ncouches his statements carefully in language that would deter his\nimprisonment on grounds of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9. He also says,\nfor example, that insofar as the individual self is historically\nformed it must be understood as a nationally identified self; and\nfurther that it is selfish merely to seek one\u2019s own peace of mind. In\nthe end, Nishida remains ambiguous about the extent to which\nindividuals are, or should be, formed by the will of the state, and\nwhether religion can or should criticize the state or society.\n\n\nTo say that culture is essentially religious means that it, too, is an\n\u201caffirmation of the self-negating absolute\u201d (NKZ XI,\n458). Religion and culture are each framed in the singular here, as\nsomething essential to all religions and cultures in the plural. At\nthis level culture and religion function almost as regulative\nideas. They are not the result but the telos of the one world forming\nits self-identity. Nishida\u2019s formulations recapitulate much of his\ntheory of the historical world.  As the various ethnic peoples in the\nworld become aware of themselves as constituents of a global world,\nthat is, as they become \u201cworld-historical\u201d nations, they\nmirror the formation of the historical world. As self-aware and globally historical, the world will be mirrored\nvariously in each nation.\n\n\nIf we hear Hegelian echoes in these formulations, we should also\nnote Nishida\u2019s difference from Hegel: the formation of the\n\u201cworld-historical\u201d world does not imply a hierarchy of\ncultures evolving as forms of increasing rationality; and it is\nexemplified in the everyday, as Nishida says, not the\nexceptional. Nishida\u2019s global world seems more open to a genuine\npluralism of cultures, world religions and national identities. Each\ncan retain its uniqueness but to do so each must become self-aware by\nbecoming aware of the plurality, by relativizing or negating itself.\nThis self-negation creates the space in which true intercultural\nencounter can take place. Nishida implies that the proper relation\nbetween cultures is parallel to that between \u201cI and Thou.\u201d\nIn simpler language: \u201cA true world culture will be formed only\nby various cultures preserving their own respective viewpoints, but\nsimultaneously developing themselves through global mediation\u201d\n(NKZ VII, pp. 452\u20133).\n\n\nNevertheless a special place is accorded the nation of Japan. The\nJapanese nation is in a position to foster not only an awareness of\nthe East but also a global awareness on the part of every nation. For\nJapan is the nation in Asia that has best retained Asian traditions\nwhile adapting Western technology and values. In the new world order\nJapan can stand for Asia, and stand against the domination of the\nWest.  Nishida\u2019s language, perhaps deliberately ambiguous to avoid his\nincarceration, ostensibly wavers as to whether this special mission\ndescribes Japan\u2019s calling, what it can be for the world, or refers to\nits current practice in its war-time struggle with other nations. A\ncharitable reading of Nishida\u2019s statements on the special place of\nJapan interprets them as advocating that his country overcome its\noutdated vision of itself as a colonizing nation, and embrace a global\nconception of itself as a nation interacting with other nations in a\nworld of mutually defining\n equals.[4] \n A more critical reading interprets these statements as falsely\nabsolutizing the particular nation of Japan, suggesting that\nJapan embraces other nations of the East which is abstractly\nopposed to the West. Similar challenges face us in the\ntwenty-first century not only in a world of continuing imperialism and contesting nations with different religious and cultural traditions, but also in single nations\nof multicultural composition.\n",
