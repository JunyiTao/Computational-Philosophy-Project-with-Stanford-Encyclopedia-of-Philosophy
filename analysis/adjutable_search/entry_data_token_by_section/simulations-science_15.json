    "main_text": "Computer Simulation and the structure of scientific theories\n6. Computer Simulation and the structure of scientific theories\n\n\nPaul Humphreys (2004) has argued that computer simulations\nhave profound implications for our understanding of the structure of\ntheories; he argues that they reveal inadequacies with both the\nsemantic and syntactic views of scientific theories. This claim has\ndrawn sharp fire from Roman Frigg and Julian Reiss (2009). Frigg and\nReiss argue that whether a model admits of analytic solution or not has\nno bearing on how it relates to the world. They use the example of the\ndouble pendulum to show this. Whether or not the pendulum\u2019s inner\nfulcrum is held fixed (a fact which will determine whether the relevant\nmodel is analytically solvable) has no bearing on the semantics of the\nelements of the model. From this, they conclude that the semantics of a\nmodel, or how it relates to the world, is unaffected by whether or not\nthe model is analytically solvable.\n\n\n This was not responsive, however,\nto the most charitable reading of what Humphreys was pointing at. The\nsyntactic and semantic views of theories, after all, were not just\naccounts of how our abstract scientific representations relate to the\nworld. More particularly, they were not stories about the\nrelation between particular models and the world, but rather about the\nrelation between theories and the world, and the role, if any,\nthat models played in that relation.\n\n\nThey were also stories that had a lot to say about where the\nphilosophically interesting action is when it comes to scientific\ntheorizing. The syntactic view suggested that scientific practice could\nbe adequately rationally reconstructed by thinking of theories as\naxiomatic systems, and, more importantly, that logical deduction was a\nuseful regulative ideal for thinking about how inferences from theory\nto the world are drawn. The syntactic view also, by omission, made if\nfairly clear that modeling played, if anything, only a\nheuristic role in science. (This was a feature of the\nsyntactic view of theories that Frederick Suppe, one of its most ardent\ncritics, often railed against.) Theories themselves had nothing\nto do with models, and theories could be compared directly to\nthe world, without any important role for modeling to play.\n\n\nThe semantic view of theories, on the other hand, did emphasize an\nimportant role for models, but it also urged that theories were\nnon-linguistic entities. It urged philosophers not to be distracted by\nthe contingencies of the particular form of linguistic expression a\ntheory might be found in, say, a particular textbook.\n\n\nComputer simulations, however, do seem to illustrate that both of\nthese themes were misguided. It was profoundly wrong to think that\nlogical deduction was the right tool for rationally reconstructing the\nprocess of theory application. Computer simulations show that there are\nmethods of theory application that vastly outstrip the inferential\npower of logical deduction. The space of solutions, for example, that\nis available via logical deduction from the theory of fluids is\nmicroscopic compared with the space of applications that can be\nexplored via computer simulation. On the flip side, computer\nsimulations seem to reveal that, as Humphreys (2004) has urged, syntax\nmatters. It was wrong, it turns out, to suggest, as the semantic\nview did, that the particular linguistic form in which a scientific\ntheory is expressed is philosophically uninteresting. The syntax of the\ntheory\u2019s expression will have a deep effect on what inferences\ncan be drawn from it, what kinds of idealizations will work well with\nit, etc. Humphreys put the point as follows: \u201cthe\nspecific syntactic representation used is often crucial to the\nsolvability of the theory\u2019s equations\u201d (Humphreys 2009,\np.620). The theory of fluids can be used to\nemphasize this point: whether we express that theory in Eulerian or\nLagrangian form will deeply affect what, in practice, we can calculate\nand how; it will affect what idealizations, approximations, and\ncalculational techniques will be effective and reliable in which\ncircumstances. So the epistemology of computer simulation needs\nto be sensitive to the particular syntactic formulation of a theory,\nand how well that particular formulation has been credentialed. \nHence, it does seem right to emphasize, as Humphreys (2004) did, that\ncomputer simulations have revealed inadequacies with both the syntactic\nand semantic theories.\n",
