    "main_text": "The Dispute over the Highest Sort of Demonstration\n5. The Dispute over the Highest Sort of Demonstration\n\n\nThomas Aquinas argued that the highest sort of demonstration had as\nits middle term the real definition of the subject term (Comm. on\nPA II 1.9, 7, 19). This led him to claim that the fourth way in\nwhich something can be per se pertained to demonstration, since it\nindicates an efficient causal connection, and the minor premise will be\ntrue in a demonstration because of the efficient causal connection\nbetween the essence of the subject, as expressed in its real\ndefinition, and the attribute proven of it, making it per se in the\nfourth way.\n\n\nAlbert the Great, with his more Aristotelian metaphysics, had argued\nthat a demonstration of the highest sort would have the definition of\nthe attribute as its middle term. This sort of definition is sometimes\ncalled a causal definition, and is the rough equivalent of a real\ndefinition for an attribute. In actuality, an attribute is an accident,\nand so has no proper real definition, indicating what it is\nentirely in itself, since what it is involves its belonging to\nan appropriate subject, and it actually belongs to such a subject only\nunder favorable conditions. So a \u201creal\u201d definition for the\nattribute would have to express things extrinsic to the attribute, its\nsubject and that which brings it to actuality in the subject. For this\nreason, Ockham insists that the definition of an attribute is a nominal\ndefinition, not a real one, and Aquinas holds that the conclusion of a\ndemonstration of the highest sort will be per se both in the second way\n(presupposing the subject) and the fourth (indicating efficient\ncausation) (Aquinas, Commentary on P.A. I 10). Albert's\npreference for the definition of the attribute follows Averroes's\nopinion that the highest sort of demonstration should demonstrate not a\nmere potentiality, but an actual state of affairs. Aquinas and the\nothers who held to his view recognized that a demonstrable attribute in\na natural thing would have to be a potentiality, though, of course, an\nactuality could be demonstrated in a mathematical demonstration, where\nefficient causation is not at issue, and an occurrent attribute can be\nshown to inhere in the subject necessarily and at every time.\n\n\nThere actually seems to be a good deal more support for Albert's\nview than for Thomas's in the Posterior Analytics. Albert\nrelies in particular on Aristotle's reference to the sort of definition\nthat includes every part of a demonstration, but arranged in a\ndifferent order (Posterior Analytics II 10), which he takes to\nbe the definition of the passion which is the middle term in a\ndemonstration, and on the examples of demonstration discussed in\nPosterior Analytics II 8. Aquinas finds little support for his\nposition in the Posterior Analytics, and resorts to De\nAnima I 1 to prove his point, so that much of his more detailed\ndiscussion of demonstration of the highest sort is in fact to be found\noutside the commentary on the Posterior Analytics.\n\n\nAlbert's position was defended after Aquinas by Giles of Rome, who\nwrote an extensive literal commentary on the Posterior\nAnalytics in 1285, with many questions embedded in it, as well as\nan opusculum What is the Middle Term in Demonstration\n(1276-77). Giles follows Albert closely. Thomas had argued that\nAlbert's candidate for the highest sort of demonstration could not be\naccepted, because it assumed as its major premise that the definition\nof the attribute belongs to the subject. This, however, is\ndemonstrable, for the definition of the attribute belongs to the\nsubject only because of the subject's essential nature, if it in fact\nalways belongs to the subject, and if it does not always belong to the\nsubject, then the demonstration needs an additional premise, which is\nnot a necessary truth at all, to the effect that the external\nconditions needed for the subject to have its attribute are present. So\nprior to the proposed demonstration is a demonstration that the\ndefinition of the attribute belongs to the subject, because it belongs\nto whatever has the real definition of the subject. Giles's objection\nto this is that the major premise in such a demonstration is, as it\nwere, tautologous, there being no real distinction between the subject\nand its essence, and so the purported demonstration begs the question.\nIn order to avoid begging the question, both premisses would have to be\nsuch that there is a real distinction between subject and predicate.\nThe argument had been made against Albert's position that the\ndefinition of the attribute and the attribute itself were identical, so\nthat Albert's candidate for demonstration of the highest sort begged\nthe question, but Giles (and Ockham after him) points out that the\ndefinition of the attribute, being a causal definition of something\nwhose existence depends on other things, refers obliquely to things\nother than the attribute itself, and so is not in fact really identical\nwith it. The same point cannot be made in defense of the affirmation of\nthe real definition of the subject of the subject, and so Giles turned\nthe tables on his opponents.\n\n\nThis was a powerful objection. The standard reply to it is developed\nin John of Cornwall's Questions on the Posterior Analytics\n(1298-1300), and Walter Burleigh's Questions and\nCommentary on the Posterior Analytics (1300-10). John\nof Cornwall's work was at one time thought to be Scotus's, and it\ncertainly seems to reflect Scotus's thinking on this point (Opus\nOxoniensis I, Distinction 2, Question 2). The defense is to claim\nthat there are two sorts of concepts possible of a substance,\nquidditative concepts, which are captured in the real definition, and\nconcepts that express the quiddity only confusedly. Someone who does\nnot know what the quiddity of a lion is nonetheless may have a concept\nof lion if he has encountered lions, but his concept is\nnon-quidditative. To avoid begging the question in a demonstration of\nthe highest sort, one must assert the quidditative concept of the\nnon-quidditative concept of a substance. So, if one says that a lion\n(as commonly conceived) is in fact an animal with a certain genetic\ncode, say, this is not a mere tautology, for the notion of the genetic\ncode is not included in the everyday, non-quidditative concept of lion.\nGiles's reply is to the effect that the confused, simple concept of a\nsubstance possessed by the ordinary fellow in fact refers to the same\nreality as the real definition does, so that asserting the real\ndefinition of the confused concept simply asserts that the reality is\nitself, and so is a triviality, after all. This, of course, is not true\nof the definition of an attribute, since it obliquely refers to things\nother than the reality that is the attribute, namely its causes. So to\ndiscover the real definition of human and assert it of the simple,\nconfused concept of human being is not to convey new information. To\nsee the point of this reply, we must see that the standard way of\nidentifying the real nature of a human being is simply to place it in\nits genus and identify its specific difference, but it is arguable that\ndoing this in the case of a substance gives us no new information, but\nonly places the thing in the right spot in a scheme of classification.\nIt is a little hard to see how \u201ca human being is a\nrational animal\u201d does anything more than identify what we want to\ntalk about. Of course, to say that this concrete\nthing is a rational animal is informative, but does it give us any\ndifferent information than the assertion that this concrete thing is a\nhuman being? On the other hand, the causal definition of an attribute\nreally does add to our information about it, as when we find that the\nnoise-in-the-cloud, i.e. thunder, is a\nnoise-in-the-cloud-produced-by-the-extinction-of-fire. These two\nnotions are really distinct, for the one refers obliquely to fire, and\nthe other does not.\n\n\nGiles's objection to the view that the definition of the subject is\nthe middle term in the highest sort of demonstration would be\nparticularly difficult for Thomas to meet, since Thomas agreed with\nGiles on the unicity of substantial form. Ockham and the Franciscan\ntradition in general, which rejects this doctrine, might hold that the\nreal definition of human being, say, does refer to real parts that need\nnot be referred to in a confused, simple concept of human being.\nScotus, of course, has an additional resource available, for he can\ndeploy a formal distinction between the individual and its essence here\n(which would not be recognized by Ockham or Thomas), even when the\nindividual has but a single substantial form.\n",
