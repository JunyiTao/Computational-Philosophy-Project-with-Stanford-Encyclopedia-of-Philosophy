    "main_text": "Modality and Existence || The Results of the Analysis\n4.3 The Results of the Analysis\n\nIn sum, the analysis of the thinkability of existence demonstrates\nthat: \n\n existence and necessity are related or even coincident: every\nexistent is necessary, either per se or per aliud;\n\nby virtue of this correlation existents are divided into two\ngeneral categories: those that, considered in themselves require no\n(causal) connection with anything other than themselves, and those\nthat, as they do need a (causal) link with something other, are not\n(in themselves) necessary; \n independence and dependence on some other correspond respectively\nto the necessity and non-necessity of \u201cbeing\u201d or the\nexistent; \n everything that is not necessary in itself and is not made\nnecessary by something other, is possible as regards both existence\nand non-existence: as such, without a necessitating cause it does not\nexist; the possible is thus exactly what must establish a causal\nrelation as regards its own existence, which ultimately leads us back\nto a necessary and absolute cause; \nthe ontological field of what is in itself necessary can\ncomprehend only one being, simple and absolutely one and unique: the\nintellect can conceive of only one being whose existence is unrelated\nto a cause, while it conceives of things as multiple only by virtue of\na relation or a connection to a\n cause;[9]\n\nthe relationship between two things always implies a causal\nrelation (of two separate things, either one is the cause of the\nother, or both are caused by a third entity), which clearly shows the\nneed of a vertical causality (from a superior to an inferior level of\nbeing). \n\n\nThis general law governs Avicenna\u2019s emanative theory: it is\nalways a third and superior cause that accounts for two apparently\ncorrelated existing elements (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 7, 39,\n16\u201342).\n",
