    "main_text": "Varieties of Anarchism || Theoretical Anarchism\n1.3 Theoretical Anarchism\n\nAnarchist rejection of authority has application in epistemology and\nin philosophical and literary theory. One significant usage of the\nterm shows up in American pragmatism. William James described his\npragmatist philosophical theory as a kind of anarchism: \u201cA\nradical pragmatist is a happy-go-lucky anarchistic sort of\ncreature\u201d (James 1907 [1981: 116]). James had anarchist\nsympathies, connected to a general critique of systematic philosophy\n(see Fiala 2013b). Pragmatism, like other anti-systematic and\npost-Hegelian philosophies, gives up on the search for an\narch\u00e9 or foundation.\n\nAnarchism thus shows up as a general critique of prevailing methods.\nAn influential example is found in the work of Paul Feyerabend, whose\nAgainst Method provides an example of \u201ctheoretical\nanarchism\u201d in epistemology and philosophy of science (Feyerabend\n1975 [1993]). Feyerabend explains:\n\n\nScience is an essentially anarchic enterprise: theoretical anarchism\nis more humanitarian and more likely to encourage progress than its\nlaw-and-order alternatives. (Feyerabend 1975 [1993: 9])\n\n\nHis point is that science ought not be constrained by hierarchically\nimposed principles and strict rule following.\n\nPost-structuralism and trends in post-modernism and Continental\nphilosophy can also be anarchistic (see May 1994). So-called\n\u201cpost-anarchism\u201d is a decentered and free-flowing\ndiscourse that deconstructs power, questions essentialism, and\nundermines systems of authority. Following upon the deconstructive and\ncritical work of authors such as Derrida, Deleuze, Foucault, and\nothers, this critique of the arch\u00e9 goes all the way\ndown. If there is no arch\u00e9 or foundation, then we are\nleft with a proliferation of possibilities. Emerging trends in\nglobalization, cyber-space, and post-humanism make the anarchist\ncritique of \u201cthe state\u201d more complicated, since\nanarchism\u2019s traditional celebration of liberty and autonomy can\nbe critically scrutinized and deconstructed (see Newman 2016).\n\nTraditional anarchists were primarily interested in sustained and\nfocused political activism that led toward the abolition of the state.\nThe difference between free-flowing post-anarchism and traditional\nanarchism can be seen in the realm of morality. Anarchism has\ntraditionally been critical of centralized moral authority\u2014but\nthis critique was often based upon fundamental principles and\ntraditional values, such as autonomy or liberty. But\npost-structuralism\u2014along with critiques articulated by some\nfeminists, critical race theorists, and critics of\nEurocentrism\u2014calls these values and principles into\nquestion.\n",
