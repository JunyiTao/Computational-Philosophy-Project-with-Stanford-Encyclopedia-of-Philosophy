In addition economists and philosophers have worked on the\nproblem of providing a formal characterization of freedom so as to\nbring tools of economic analysis to bear (Pattanaik and Xu 1990, Sen\n1988, 1990, 1991, Carter 1999, Sugden 2018). Others have developed\nformal characterizations of social welfare functions that prioritize\nthe interests of those who are less well off or that favor equality of\nresources, opportunity, and outcomes and that separate individual and\nsocial responsibility for inequalities (Pazner and Schmeidler 1974,\nVarian 1974, 1975, Roemer 1986b, 1987, Fleurbaey 1995, 2008, Fleurbaey\nand Maniquet 2014, Greaves 2015, McCarthy 2015, 2017). John Roemer has\nput contemporary economic modeling to work to offer precise\ncharacterizations of exploitation (1982). Amartya Sen and Martha\nNussbaum have not only developed novel interpretations of the proper\nconcerns of normative economics in terms of capabilities (Sen 1992,\nNussbaum and Sen 1993, Nussbaum 2000), which Sen has linked to\ncharacterizations of egalitarianism and to operational measures of\ndeprivation (1999). There are many lively interactions between\nnormative economics and moral philosophy. See also the entries on\n libertarianism,\n paternalism,\n egalitarianism,\n and\n economics [normative] and economic justice.\n",
