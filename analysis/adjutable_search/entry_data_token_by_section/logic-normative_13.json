    "main_text": "Further challenges || Consistency and coherence\n5.2 Consistency and coherence\n\nAt the outset we identified two logical properties as the two central\nprotagonists in any story about the normative status of logic:\nconsistency and logical consequence. So far our focus has been almost\nexclusively on consequence. Let us now briefly turn to norms of\nconsistency.\n\nThe most natural and straightforward argument for consistency is that\nthe corresponding norm\u2014something along the lines of\n CON\u2014is\n entailed by the truth norm for belief:\n\n(TN)  For any\nproposition \\(A\\), if an agent \\(S\\) considers or has reason to consider\n\\(A\\), \\(S\\) ought to believe \\(A\\) if and only if \\(A\\) is\n true.[21]\n \n\n\nThe truth norm entails the consistency norm (given certain\nassumptions):\n\n(CN) For any\nagent \\(S\\), the set of propositions believed by \\(S\\) at any given\ntime ought to be logically consistent. \n\n\nFor if the set of propositions I believe at a particular point in time\nis inconsistent, they cannot all be true, which is to say that I am\nviolating the truth norm with respect to at least one of my\nbeliefs.\n\nSome objections to the consistency norm are closely related to the\nconsiderations of\n Excessive Demands.\n And even in cases where it would be within our powers to discover an\ninconsistency given our resources of computational power, time and so\non, it may still be reasonable to prioritize other cognitive aims\nrather than expending significant resources to resolve a minor\ninconsistency (Harman 1986). However, many authors who invoke\n (CN)\n do so in a highly idealized context. They think of the norm not as\nreason-giving or as a basis for attributing blame, but merely as an\nevaluative norm: an agent with an inconsistent belief set is less than\nperfectly\n rational.[22]\n\n\nAnother reason for rejecting\n CON\n is dialetheism (see entry on\n dialetheism).\n Clearly, if there are true contradictions, there are special cases in which one ought to have inconsistent beliefs.\n\nBut there is a further worry about consistency borne out of less\ncontroversial assumptions. It stems from the aforementioned fact that\nwe do not only evaluate our beliefs according to their truth status\nbut also in terms of their reasonableness in light of the evidence.\nAccordingly, there would seem to be an epistemic norm, like\n (EN)\n in the supplement on Bridge Principles,\n  that one ought to (or may) believe a proposition only if that\nproposition is likely to be true given the evidence. But if that is\nso, the following well-known scenario may arise: it may be that, for a\nset of propositions, I ought to (may) believe each of them in light of\nthe evidence, yet\u2014because evidential support is not\nfactive\u2014the resulting belief set turns out to be inconsistent.\nTherefore, if rationality demands that I align my beliefs with the\nevidence, rationality is no guarantee for logical consistency. Of\ncourse, it is precisely this clash between our (local) evidential norm\nand the (global) coherence norm of logical consistency that is\ndramatized in the Preface and in the Lottery paradoxes.\n\nIn light of such considerations, no small number of\nauthors have come to reject the consistency norm (see inter\nalia Kyburg 1970 and Christensen 2004). A particularly\ninteresting positive alternative proposal was recently made by Branden\nFitelson and Kenny Easwaran (Fitelson and Easwaran 2015, Easwaran 2015). They advance\na range of sub-consistency coherence norms for full belief inspired by\nJoyce-style accuracy-dominance arguments for probabilism as a norm for\ncredences (see Joyce 1998, 2009 and also the entry on\n epistemic utility arguments for probabilism).\n One important such norm is based on the following conception of\ncoherence. Roughly, a belief set is coherent just in case there is no\nalternative belief set that outperforms it in terms of its lower\nmeasure of inaccuracy across all possible worlds, i.e., just in case\nit is not weakly dominated with respect to accuracy.\n",
