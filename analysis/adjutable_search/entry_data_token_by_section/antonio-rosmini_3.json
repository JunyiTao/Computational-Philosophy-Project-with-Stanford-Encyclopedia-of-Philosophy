The Dignity of the Human Person\n\n\nIt is already clear from what has been said that Rosmini, in his\nsolution to the basic problem of knowledge, has offered a perspective\nwhich places human dignity on a transcendent level. Human beings are\nmade such, he would maintain, by the intuition of being which\naccompanies them from the first moment of their existence. Through this\nintuition, they share in the finality of being itself and in some\nfinite way participate in its infinite characteristics. Nevertheless,\nthe subjective element proper to the human being neither can nor should\nbe denied. Indeed, it has to be examined thoroughly if a rational\naccount is to be rendered of the essential unitary make-up of human\nnature. This examination was carried out initially in Rosmini\u2019s A\nNew Essay concerning the Origin of Ideas as part of his\nexplanation of what he called \u2018impure\u2019 ideas, that is, ideas\nwhich, as perceptive (not simply intellective), require for their\norigin some sense experience. He pursued the investigation in his\nAnthropology as an Aid to Moral Science and in\nPsychology where in four volumes entitled The Essence of\nthe Human Soul, The Development of the Human Soul,\nLaws of Animality and Opinions about the Human Soul,\nhe observed and discussed at length the animal, as well as the\nintellectual side of human nature.\n\n\nThe first fact presented by observation on ourselves is the\nessential distinction in human beings between that which feels and that\nwhich is felt. According to Rosmini, these are quite different and\nunconfusible elements with opposite characteristics. That which feels\nis an immaterial principle (soul); that which is felt is the term\n(body) of this principle. Together feeler and felt constitute feeling,\nthe underlying subject of reflection when attention is concentrated on\n\u2018myself\u2019 and those elements which constitute\n\u2018myself\u2019. The chief action of body is to produce an\nundetermined, shapeless extension which enables that which feels to\nexperience determined sensations of various kinds. This\n\u2018fundamental feeling\u2019, with its permanent perception of\nunlimited space, is that in which all other feelings are perceived, and\nruns parallel, as it were, with the idea of being in which all other\nideas are intuited. Reaction to perceived feelings constitutes vital\ninstinct (relative to the fundamental feeling) and sensuous instinct\n(relative to the adventitious sensations). All feeling and instinct is\nper se unknown in Rosmini\u2019s view, and comes to be known\nthrough the formation in the knowing subject of ideas and perceptions\nwhich depend upon the illumination provided by the idea of being. Thus,\nfor Rosmini, the human being is a knowing and feeling subject, having\nwithin itself a principle which, formed by the light of being, knows\nand reacts to what it knows through the faculties of intellect and\nwill, and feels and reacts to what it feels through the faculties of\nsense and instinct. Within the human subject, the will - which reacts\nto what is known\u2014is the supreme active principle and as such\nconstitutes \u2018person\u2019 in the individual. The dignity of the\nhuman being lies within the will as such, in the first place, and then\nwithin the will\u2019s choice to second whatever the intellect knows. This\nis also the foundation of genuine freedom within the human subject.\nFree to adhere to or reject what is known, human beings cannot be\ncoerced by attempted external pressure or used as a means by others\nwithout prejudice to the inviolable truth in which they share innately\nthrough their participation in the light of being and which they attain\nadventitiously through the direct perception that unfolds determined\ntruths to their intellectual gaze.\n",
