    "main_text": "Modality and the causal relation || Averroes on causal necessity in nature\n3.3 Averroes on causal necessity in nature\n\nIn the Incoherence of the Incoherence, Averroes challenges\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s portrayal of the philosophers\u2019 account\nof causal necessity as follows:\n\n\n[A]re the acts which proceed from all things absolutely necessary for\nthose in whose nature it lies to perform them, or are they only\nperformed in most cases or in half the cases? This is a question which\nmust be investigated, since one single action-and-passivity between\ntwo existent things occurs only through one relation out of an\ninfinite number, and it happens often that one relation hinders\nanother. Therefore it is not absolutely certain that fire acts when it\nis brought near a sensitive body, for surely it is not improbable that\nthere should be something which stands in such a relation to the\nsensitive thing as to hinder the action of the fire, as is asserted of\ntalc and other things. But one need not therefore deny fire its\nburning power so long as fire keeps its name and definition. (Averroes\nITI: 318\u201319)\n\n\nAverroes affirms that natural substances, such as fire, are causes.\nYet, he claims that, given fire\u2019s nearness to cotton, it is not\n\u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d, nor \u201cabsolutely\ncertain\u201d that the cotton burns. In this sentence, he seems to\ndeny that causal connections are necessary connections. On the other\nhand, the reason he denies that fire\u2019s nearness to cotton\nnecessitates the burning of the cotton is that there may be an\nimpediment: the cotton could be covered in talc, which hinders the\naction of the fire. And he suggests that, absent this impediment, the\nburning would certainly take place. So, while he initially seems to\ndeny that causal connections are necessary connections, his overall\nargument suggests that he affirms this claim. Furthermore, his account\nof causal necessity involves a more nuanced version of\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s claim (iii) above (that the affirmation\nof contact between fire and cotton entails the affirmation of the\nburning of the cotton). According to Averroes\u2019 account of causal\nnecessity, the affirmation of contact between fire and cotton, and the\naffirmation that there are no impediments, together entail the\naffirmation of the burning of the cotton.\n\nIn sum, Averroes responds to al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s \u201cno\nnecessary connection\u201d argument as follows. He claims that\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b misreports the philosophers\u2019 account of\ncausal necessity in nature. Furthermore, he suggests that his revised\nversion of their account is true. So, the philosophers\u2019 account\nof causal necessity in nature, properly understood, is not\nmistaken.\n\nIt is worth noting that Averroes\u2019 own account of causal\nnecessity in nature is roughly in accord with Avicenna\u2019s. As\ndiscussed above (in\n \u00a73.1),\n Avicenna holds that \u201cwith the existence of its cause, the\nexistence of the effect is necessary\u201d. He also holds, however,\nthat the existence of a sublunary substance, which functions as a\ncause, is, typically, not sufficient for the exercise of its causality\nand, thus, typically, not sufficient for the existence of the effect\nof its causality. For example, fire functions as a cause of the\nburning of cotton only when its power to burn is actualized in the\ncotton. This not only requires that contact between agent (fire) and\npatient (cotton) be unimpeded but also that the patient (cotton) is\nitself in a suitable state, e.g., the cotton is not wet.\n",
