    "main_text": "Frege\u2019s Theory of Extensions: Basic Law V || Basic Law V for Concepts\n2.4 Basic Law V for Concepts\n\nWe can now represent the special case of Frege\u2019s Basic Law V\nthat applies to concepts, using our \\(\\epsilon\\) notation:\n\nBasic Law V (Special Case):\n\n\\(\\epsilon F\\eqclose \\epsilon G \\equivwide \\forall x(Fx \\equiv Gx)\\)\n\n\nIn this special case, Basic Law V asserts: the extension of the\nconcept \\(F\\) is identical to the extension of the concept \\(G\\) if\nand only if all and only the objects that fall under \\(F\\) fall under\n\\(G\\) (i.e., if and only if the concepts \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are\nmaterially equivalent). In more modern guise, Frege\u2019s Basic Law\nV asserts that the set of \\(F\\)s is identical to the set of \\(G\\)s if\nand only if \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are materially equivalent:\n\n\\(\\{x\\mid Fx\\}\\eqclose \\{y\\mid Gy\\} \\equivwide \\forall z(Fz \\equiv\nGz)\\) \n\nThe example discussed above can now be seen as an instance of Basic\nLaw V:\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n&\\epsilon[\\lambda y \\, y + 4 = 5] = \\epsilon[\\lambda y \\, y+2^{2} = 5] \\equiv\\\\\n&\\quad \\forall x([\\lambda y \\, y+4 = 5]x\\equiv [\\lambda y \\, y+2^{2} = 5]x)\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nThis asserts that the extension of the concept that which added\nto 4 yields 5 is identical to the extension of the\nconcept that which added to \\(2^{2}\\) yields 5 if\nand only if all and only the objects that when added to 4 yield 5 are\nobjects that when added to \\(2^{2}\\) yield 5.\n\nThere are two important corollaries to Law V that play a role in what\nfollows: the Law of Extensions and the Principle of Extensionality.\nThe Law of Extensions (cf. Gg I, \u00a755, Theorem 1)\nasserts that an object is a member of the extension of a concept if\nand only if it falls under that concept:\n\nLaw of Extensions:\n\n\\(\\forall F \\forall x(x \\in\\epsilon F \\equiv Fx)\\) \n\n (Derivation of the Law of Extensions)\n\nBasic Law V also correctly implies the Principle of Extensionality.\nThis principle asserts that if two extensions have the same members,\nthey are identical. Let us define \u2018\\(x\\) is an\nextension\u2019 as follows:\n\n\\(\\mathit{Extension}(x) \\eqdef \\exists F (x = \\epsilon F)\\) \n\nThen we may formally represent and derive the principle of\nextensionality as follows:\n\nPrinciple of Extensionality:\n\n\\(\\mathit{Extension}(x) \\amp \\mathit{Extension}(y) \\to [\\forall z(z\n\\in x\\equiv z\\in y) \\to x\\eqclose y]\\) \n\n (Derivation of the Principle of Extensionality)\n\nThe above facts about Basic Law V will be used in the next subsections\nto show why it may not be consistently added to second-order\nlogic with comprehension. Frege was made aware of the inconsistency by\nBertrand Russell, who sent him a letter formulating\n\u2018Russell\u2019s Paradox\u2019 just as the second volume of\nGg was going to press. Frege quickly added an\nAppendix to the second volume, describing two distinct ways of\nderiving a contradiction from Basic Law V. He also suggested a way of\nrepairing Law V, but Quine (1995) later showed that such a repair was\ndisastrous, since it would force the domain of objects to contain at\nmost one object.\n\nIn the next subsections, we describe the two ways of deriving a\ncontradiction from Basic Law V that Frege described in the Appendix to\nGg. The first establishes the contradiction directly, without\nany special definitions. The second deploys the membership relation\nand more closely follows Russell\u2019s Paradox. As we shall see, the\nfollowing combination is a volatile mix: (a) the Comprehension\nPrinciple for concepts, which ensures that there is a concept\ncorresponding to every formula with free variable \\(x\\), (b) the\nExistence of Extensions principle, which ensures every concept is\ncorrelated with an extension, and (c) Basic Law V, which ensures that\nthe correlation of concepts with extensions behaves in a certain\nway.\n",
