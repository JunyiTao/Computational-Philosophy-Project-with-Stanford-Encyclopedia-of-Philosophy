    "main_text": "Archytas and the Sciences || The Value of the Sciences\n3.1 The Value of the Sciences\n\nArchytas B1 is the beginning of his book on harmonics, and most of it\nis devoted to the basic principles of his theory of acoustics and, in\nparticular, to his theory of pitch described in section 2.2 above. In\nthe first five lines, however, Archytas provides a proem on the value\nof the sciences (math\u00eamata) in general. There are\nseveral important features of this proem. First, Archytas identifies a\nset of four sciences: astronomy, geometry, \u201clogistic\u201d\n(arithmetic) and music. B1 is thus probably the earliest text to\nidentify the set of sciences that became known as the\nquadrivium in the middle ages and that constitute four of the\nseven liberal arts. Second, Archytas does not present this\nclassification of sciences as his own discovery but instead begins\nwith praise of his predecessors who have worked in these fields. Some\nscholars argue that, when he praises \u201cthose concerned with the\nsciences,\u201d he is thinking only of the Pythagoreans (e.g., Zhmud\n1997, 198 and Lasserre 1954, 36), but this is wrongly to assume that\nall early Greek mathematics is Pythagorean. Archytas gives no hint\nthat he is limiting his remarks to Pythagoreans, and, in areas where\nwe can identify those who influenced him most, these figures are not\nlimited to Pythagoreans (e.g., Hippocrates of Chios in geometry, see\nsection 2.1). He praises his predecessors in the sciences, because,\n\u201chaving discerned well about the nature of wholes, they were\nlikely also to see well how things are in their parts\u201d and to\n\u201chave correct understanding about individual things as they\nare.\u201d It is here that Archytas is putting forth his own\nunderstanding of the nature and value of the sciences; because of the\nbrevity of the passage, much remains unclear. Archytas appears to be\npraising those concerned with the sciences for their discernment,\ntheir ability to make distinctions (diagign\u00f4skein). He\nargues that they begin by distinguishing the nature of wholes, the\nuniversal concepts of a science, and, because they do this well, they\nare able to understand particular objects (the parts). Archytas\nappears to follow exactly this procedure in his Harmonics. He\nbegins by defining the most universal concept of the science, sound,\nand explains it in terms of other concepts such as impact, before\ngoing on to distinguish between audible and inaudible sounds and\nsounds of high and low pitch. The goal of the science is not the\nmaking of these distinctions concerning universal concepts, however,\nbut knowledge of the true nature of individual things. Thus,\nArchytas\u2019 harmonics ends with the mathematical description of\nthe musical intervals that we hear practicing musicians use (see\nsection 2.2 above). Astronomy will end with a mathematical description\nof the periods, risings and settings of the planets. One way to\nunderstand Archytas\u2019 project is to see him as working out the\nprogram suggested by his predecessor in the Pythagorean tradition,\nPhilolaus. One of Philolaus\u2019 central theses was that we only\ngain knowledge of things insofar as we can give an account of them in\nterms of numbers (DK 44 B4). While Philolaus only took the first steps\nin this project, Archytas is much more successful in giving an account\nof individual things in the phenomenal world in terms of numbers, as\nhis description of the musical intervals shows.\n\nPlato\u2019s account of the sciences in Book VII of the\nRepublic can be seen as a response to Archytas\u2019 view of\nthe sciences. First Plato identifies a group of five rather than four\nsciences and decries the neglect of his proposed fifth science,\nstereometry (solid geometry), with a probable allusion to Archytas\n(see section 2.1). Plato quotes with approval Archytas\u2019\nassertion that \u201cthese sciences seem to be akin\u201d (B1),\nalthough he applies it just to harmonics and astronomy rather than to\nArchytas\u2019 quadrivium and does not mention him by name.\nIn the same passage, however, Plato pointedly rejects the Pythagorean\nattempt to search for numbers in \u201cheard harmonies.\u201d In\ndoing so Plato is disagreeing with Archytas\u2019 attempt to\ndetermine the numbers that govern things in the sensible world. For\nPlato, the value of the sciences is their ability to turn the eye of\nthe soul from the sensible to the intelligible realm. Book VII of the\nRepublic with its elaborate argument for the distinction\nbetween the intelligible and sensible realm, between the cave and the\nintelligible world outside the cave, may be in large part directed at\nArchytas\u2019 attempt to use mathematics to explain the sensible\nworld. As Aristotle repeatedly emphasizes, the Pythagoreans differed\nfrom Plato precisely in their refusal to separate numbers from things\n(e.g., Metaph. 987b27).\n3.2 Logistic as the Master Science\n\nIn B4, Archytas asserts that \u201clogistic seems to be far superior\nindeed to the other arts in regard to wisdom.\u201d What does\nArchytas mean by \u201clogistic\u201d? It appears to be\nArchytas\u2019 term for the science of number, which was mentioned as\none of the four sister sciences in B1. There is simply not enough\ncontext in B4 or other texts of Archytas to determine the meaning of\nlogistic from Archytas\u2019 usage alone. It is necessary to rely to\nsome extent on Plato, who is the only other early figure to use the\nterm extensively. A later conception of logistic, as something that\ndeals with numbered things rather than numbers themselves, which is\nfound in, e.g., Geminus, should not be ascribed to Plato or Archytas\n(Klein 1968; Burkert 1972a, 447 n. 119). In Plato,\n\u201clogistic\u201d can refer to everyday calculation, what we\nwould call arithmetic (e.g. 3 \u00d7 700 = 2,100; see, Hp.\nMi. 366c). In other passages, however, Plato defines logistic in\nparallel with arithm\u00eatik\u00ea, and treats the two of\nthem as together constituting the science of number, on which\npractical manipulation of number is based (Klein 1968, 23\u201324).\nBoth arithm\u00eatik\u00ea and logistic deal with the even\nand the odd. Arithm\u00eatik\u00ea focuses not on\nquantities but on kinds of numbers (Grg. 451b), beginning\nwith the even and the odd and presumably continuing with the types we\nfind later in Nicomachus (Ar. 1.8 \u2013 1.13), such as\nprime, composite and even-times even. Logistic, on the other hand,\nfocuses on quantity, the \u201camount the odd and even have both in\nthemselves and in respect to one another\u201d (Grg. 451c).\nAn example of one part of logistic might be the study of various sorts\nof means and proportions, which focus on the quantitative relations of\nnumbers to one another (e.g., Nicomachus, Ar. II. 21 ff.). In\nB2, Archytas would probably consider himself to be doing logistic,\nwhen he defines the three types of means which are relevant to music\n(geometric, arithmetic, and harmonic). The geometric mean arises\nwhenever three terms are so related that, as the first is to the\nsecond, so the second is to the third (e.g., 8 : 4 :: 4 : 2) and the\narithmetic, when three terms are so related that the first exceeds the\nsecond by the same amount as the second exceeds the third (e.g., 6 : 4\n:: 4 : 2). Archytas, like Plato (R. 525c), uses logistic not\njust in this narrow sense of the study of relative quantity, but also\nto designate the entire science of numbers including\narithm\u00eatik\u00ea.\n\nWhy does Archytas think that logistic is superior to the other\nsciences? In B4, he particularly compares it to geometry, arguing that\nlogistic (1) \u201cdeals with what it wishes more vividly than\ngeometry\u201d and (2) \u201ccompletes demonstrations\u201d where\ngeometry cannot, even \u201cif there is any investigation concerning\nshapes.\u201d This last remark is surprising, since the study of\nshapes would appear to be the proper domain of geometry. The most\ncommon way of explaining Archytas\u2019 remark is to suppose that he\nis arguing that logistic is mathematically superior to geometry, in\nthat certain proofs can only be completed by an appeal to logistic.\nBurkert sees this as a reason for doubting the authenticity of the\nfragment, since the exact opposite seems to be true. Archytas could\ndetermine the cube root of two geometrically, through his solution to\nthe duplication of the cube, but could not do so arithmetically, since\nthe cube root of two is an irrational number (1972a, 220 n. 14). Other\nscholars have pointed out, however, that certain proofs in geometry do\nrequire an appeal to logistic (Knorr 1975, 311; Mueller 1992b, 90 n.\n12), e.g., logistic is required to recognize the incomensurability of\nthe diagonal with the side of the square, since incommensurability\narises when two magnitudes \u201chave not to one another the ratio\nwhich number has to number\u201d (Euclid X 7). These\nsuggestions show that logistic can be superior to geometry in certain\ncases, but they do not explain Archytas\u2019 more general assertion\nthat logistic deals with whatever problems it wants more clearly than\ngeometry.\n\nHowever, it may be that B4 is not in fact comparing logistic to the\nother sciences as sciences \u2013 in terms of their relative success\nin providing demonstrations. The title of the work from which B4 is\nsaid to come, Discourses (Diatribai), is most\ncommonly used of ethical treatises. Moreover, it is specifically with\nregard to wisdom (sophia) that logistic is said to be\nsuperior, and, while sophia can refer to technical expertise,\nit more commonly refers to the highest sort of intellectual\nexcellence, often the excellence that allows us to live a good life\n(Arist., EN 1141a12; Pl., R. 428d ff.). Is there any\nsense in which logistic makes us wiser than the other sciences? Since\nArchytas evidently agreed with Philolaus that we only understand\nindividual things in the world insofar as we grasp the numbers that\ngovern them, it seems quite plausible that Archytas would regard\nlogistic as the science that makes us wise about the world. It is in\nthis sense that logistic will always be superior to geometry, even\nwhen dealing with shapes. Perhaps the most famous statue of the\nclassical period is the Doryphoros by the Argive sculptor Polyclitus,\nwhich he also referred to as the Canon (i.e., the standard). Although\nPolyclitus undoubtedly made use of geometry in constructing this\nmagnificent shape, in a famous sentence from his book, also entitled\nCanon, he asserts that his statue came to be not through many\nshapes but \u201cthrough many numbers\u201d (DK40 B2, see\nHuffman 2002a). Geometrical relations alone will not determine the\nform of a given object, we have to assign specific proportions,\nspecific numbers. Archytas also thought that numbers and logistic were\nthe basis of the just state and hence the good life. In B3 he argues\nthat it is rational calculation (logismos) that produces the\nfairness on which the state depends. Justice is a relation that needs\nto be stated numerically and it is through such a statement that rich\nand poor can live together, each seeing that he has what is fair.\nLogistic will always be superior to the other sciences, because those\nsciences will in the end rely on numbers to give us knowledge of the\nsounds we hear, the shapes we see and the movements of the heavenly\nbodies which we observe.\n3.3 Optics and Mechanics\n\nAristotle is the first Greek author to mention the sciences of optics\nand mechanics, describing optics as a subordinate science to geometry\nand mechanics as a subordinate science to solid geometry\n(APo. 78b34). Archytas does not mention either of these\nsciences in B1, when describing the work of his predecessors in the\nsciences, nor does Plato mention them. This silence suggests that the\ntwo disciplines may have first developed in the first half of the\nfourth century, when Archytas was most active, and it is possible that\nhe played an important role in the development of both of them. In a\nrecently identified fragment from his book on the Pythagoreans\n(Iamblichus, Comm. Math. XXV; see Burkert 1972a, 50 n. 112),\nAristotle assigns a hitherto unrecognized importance to optics in\nPythagoreanism. Just as the Pythagoreans were impressed with the fact\nthat musical intervals were based on whole number ratios, so they were\nimpressed that the phenomena of optics could be explained in terms of\ngeometrical diagrams. In addition to being an accomplished\nmathematician, Archytas had a theory of vision and evidently tried to\nexplain some of the phenomena involved in mirrors. In contrast to\nPlato, who argued that the visual ray, which proceeded from the eye,\nrequires the support of and coalesces with external light, Archytas\nexplained vision in terms of the visual ray alone (A25). It is\ntempting, then, to suppose that Archytas played a major role in the\ndevelopment of the mathematically based Pythagorean optics, to which\nAristotle refers. On the other hand, when Aristotle refers to\nPythagoreans, he generally means Pythagoreans of the fifth century.\nElsewhere he treats Archytas independently of the Pythagorean\ntradition, writing works on Archytas which were distinct from his work\non the Pythagoreans. It would thus be more natural to read\nAristotle\u2019s reference to Pythagorean optics as alluding to\nfifth-century Pythagoreans such as Philolaus. Archytas will then have\nbeen responsible for developing an already existing Pythagorean\noptical tradition into a science, rather than founding such a\ntradition.\n\nDiogenes Laertius reports that Archytas was \u201cthe first to\nsystematize mechanics by using mathematical first principles\u201d\n(VIII 83 = A1), and Archytas is accordingly sometimes hailed by modern\nscholars as the founder of the science of mechanics. There is a\npuzzle, however, since, no ancient Greek author in the later\nmechanical tradition (e.g., Heron, Pappus, Archimedes, Philon) ever\nascribes any work in the field to Archytas. What did the ancients mean\nby mechanics? A rough definition would be \u201cthe description and\nexplanation of the operation of machines\u201d (Knorr 1996). The\nearliest treatise in mechanics, the Mechanical Problems\nascribed to Aristotle, begins with problems having to do with a simple\nmachine, the lever. Pappus (AD 320) refers to machines used to lift\ngreat weights, machines of war such as the catapult, water lifting\nmachines, amazing devices (automata), and machines that served as\nmodels of the heavens (1024.12 \u2013 1025.4, on Pappus, see Cuomo\n2000). Pappus emphasizes, however, that, in addition to this practical\npart of mechanics, there is a theoretical part that is heavily\nmathematical (1022. 13\u201315). Given his interest in describing\nphysical phenomena in mathematical terms, it might seem logical that\nArchytas would make important contributions to mechanics. The actual\nevidence is less conclusive. A great part of the tendency to assign\nArchytas a role in the development of mechanics can be traced to\nPlutarch\u2019s story about the quarrel between Plato and Archytas\nover Archytas\u2019 supposed mechanical solution to the problem of\ndoubling the cube. This story is likely to be false (see 2.1 above).\nSome scholars have argued that Archytas devised machines of war (Diels\n1965; Cambiano 1998), as Archimedes did later, but this conclusion is\nbased on questionable inferences and no ancient source ascribes such\nmachines to Archytas. The only mechanical device that can with some\nprobability be assigned to Archytas, apart from the children\u2019s\ntoy known as a \u201cclapper\u201d (A10), is an automaton in the\nform of a wooden dove, which was connected to a pulley and\ncounterweight and \u201cflew\u201d up from a lower perch to a higher\none, when set in motion by a puff of air (A10a). Kingsley is deeply\ncritical of scholars who see these inventions as toys and suggests\nconnections to earlier Chinese inventors who produced a wooden bird\nthat could fly for military purposes (2014: 155\u20139). Others have\nsuggested that, since ancient siege devices were called by the names\nof animals (e.g., \u201ctortoise\u201d and \u201ccrow\u201d),\nArchytas\u2019 \u201cdove\u201d might have been an early catapult\nof his devising, or a projectile hurled by such a catapult, which was\nlater misunderstood to be a mechanical dove (Berryman 2003: 355; 2009:\n78). However, no ancient source explains the dove in this way. A\ncomplicating factor here is that Diogenes Laertius reports (A1) that\nthere was a book on mechanics in circulation, which some thought to be\nby a different Archytas, so that it is possible that the flying dove\nis, in fact, the work of a separate Archytas. Archytas\u2019 solution\nto the duplication of the cube, although it was not mechanical itself,\nwas of enormous importance for mechanics, since the solution to the\nproblem allows one not just to double a cube but also to construct\nbodies that are larger or smaller than a given body in any given\nratio. Thus, the solution permits the construction of a full-scale\nmachine on the basis of a working model. Pappus cites the solution to\nthe duplication of the cube as one of the three most crucial\ngeometrical theorems for practical mechanics (Math. Coll.\n1028. 18\u201321). It may then be that Archytas\u2019 primary\ncontribution to mechanics was precisely his solution to the\nduplication of the cube and that it is this solution which constituted\nthe mathematical first principles which Archytas provided for\nmechanics. For a recent discussion of these issues seen Berryman 2009:\n87\u201397. It is more doubtful that Archytas wrote a treatise on\nmechanics. Schofield has recently argued that the evidence for\nArchytas\u2019 work both in optics and in mechanics is so meagre that\nwe should \u201cbe skeptical about Archytas\u2019 alleged\nrole\u201d (2014: 86).\n4. Definitions\n\nIn the Metaphysics, Aristotle praises Archytas for having\noffered definitions which took account of both form and matter\n(1043a14\u201326 = A22). The examples given are\n\u201cwindlessness\u201d (n\u00eanemia), which is defined\nas \u201cstillness [the form] in a quantity of air [the\nmatter],\u201d and \u201ccalm-on-the-ocean\u201d\n(gal\u00ean\u00ea), which is defined as \u201clevelness\n[the form] of sea [the matter].\u201d The terms form and matter are\nAristotle\u2019s, and we cannot be sure how Archytas conceptualized\nthe two parts of his definitions. A plausible suggestion is that he\nfollowed his predecessor Philolaus in adopting limiters and unlimiteds\nas his basic metaphysical principles and that he saw his definitions\nas combinations of limiters, such as levelness and stillness, with\nunlimiteds, such as air and sea. The oddity of\n\u201cwindlessness\u201d and \u201ccalm-on-the-sea\u201d as\nexamples suggests that they were not the by-products of some other\nsort of investigation, e.g. cosmology, but were chosen precisely to\nillustrate principles of definition. Archytas may thus have devoted a\ntreatise to the topic. Aristotle elsewhere comments on the use of\nproportion in developing definitions and uses these same examples\n(Top. 108a7). The ability to recognize likeness in things of\ndifferent genera is said to be the key. \u201cWindlessness\u201d and\n\u201ccalm-on-the-ocean\u201d are recognized as alike, and this\nlikeness can be expressed in the following proportion: as\nn\u00eanemia is to the air so gal\u00ean\u00ea is\nto the sea. It is tempting to suppose that Archytas, who saw the world\nas explicable in terms of number and proportion, also saw proportion\nas the key in developing definitions. This would explain another\nreference to Archytas in Aristotle. At Rhetoric\n1412a9\u201317 (= A12) Aristotle praises Archytas precisely for his\nability to see similarity, even in things which differ greatly, and\ngives as an example Archytas\u2019 assertion that an arbitrator and\nan altar are the same. DK oddly include this text among the testimonia\nfor Archytas\u2019 life, but it clearly is part of Archytas\u2019\nwork on definition. The definitions of both an altar and an arbitrator\nwill appeal to their common functions as a refuge, while recognizing\nthe different context and way in which this function is carried out.\nFor doubts about this reconstruction of Archytas\u2019 theory of\ndefinition, see Barker 2006, 314\u2013318 and Schofield 2014, 80.\n5. Cosmology and Physics\n\nWe have very little evidence for Archytas\u2019 cosmology, yet he was\nresponsible for one of the most famous cosmological arguments in\nantiquity, an argument which has been hailed as \u201cthe most\ncompelling argument ever produced for the infinity of space\u201d\n(Sorabji 1988, 125). The argument is ascribed to Archytas in a\nfragment of Eudemus preserved by Simplicius (= A24), and it is\nprobably to Archytas that Aristotle is referring when he describes the\nfifth and \u201cmost important\u201d reason that people believe in\nthe existence of the unlimited (Ph. 203b22 ff.). Archytas\nasks anyone who argues that the universe is limited to engage in a\nthought experiment (this is one of the first recorded thought\nexperiments in antiquity): \u201cIf I arrived at the outermost edge\nof the heaven, could I extend my hand or staff into what is outside or\nnot? It would be paradoxical [given our normal assumptions about the\nnature of space] not to be able to extend it.\u201d The end of the\nstaff, once extended will mark a new limit. Archytas can advance to\nthe new limit and ask the same question again, so that there will\nalways be something, into which his staff can be extended, beyond the\nsupposed limit, and hence that something is clearly unlimited. Neither\nPlato nor Aristotle accepted this argument, and both believed that the\nuniverse was limited. Nonetheless, Archytas\u2019 argument had great\ninfluence and was taken over and adapted by the Stoics, Epicureans\n(Lucretius I 968\u2013983), Locke and Newton, among others, while\neliciting responses from Alexander and Simplicius (Sorabji 1988,\n125\u2013141). For a discussion of the relation between\nArchytas\u2019 thought experiment and other thought experiments in\nantiquity see Ierodiakonou 2011. Not all scholars have been impressed\nby the argument (see Barnes 1982, 362), and modern notions of space\nallow for it to be finite without having an edge, and without an edge\nArchytas\u2019 argument cannot get started (but see Sorabji 1988,\n160\u2013163). Beyond this argument, there is only exiguous evidence\nfor Archytas\u2019 system of the physical world. Eudemus praises\nArchytas for recognizing that the unequal and uneven are not identical\nwith motion as Plato supposed (see Ti. 52e and 57e) but\nrather the causes of motion (A23). Another testimonium suggests that\nArchytas thought that all things are moved in accordance with\nproportion (Arist., Prob. 915a25\u201332 = A23a). The same\ntestimonium indicates that different sorts of proportion defined\ndifferent sorts of motion. Archytas asserted that \u201cthe\nproportion of equality\u201d (arithmetic proportion?) defined natural\nmotion, which he regarded as curved motion (for a different account of\nthe proportion of equality see De Groot 2014: 195\u2013207). This\nexplanation of natural motion is supposed to explain why certain parts\nof plants and animals (e.g. the stem, thighs, arms and trunk) are\nrounded rather than triangular or polygonal. Some scholars argue that\nit was the influence of Archytas that led Plato and Eudemus to\nemphasize uniform circular movement in explaining the heavens (Zhmud\n2006: 97). An explanation of motion in terms of proportion fits well\nwith the rest of evidence for Archytas, but the details remain\nobscure.\n6. Ethics and Political Philosophy\n\nArchytas\u2019 search for the numbers in things was not limited to\nthe natural world. Political relationships and the moral action of\nindividuals were also explained in terms of number and proportion. In\nFr. 3, rational calculation is identified as the basis of the stable\nstate:\n\nOnce calculation (logismos) was discovered, it stopped\ndiscord and increased concord. For people do not want more than their\nshare, and equality exists, once this has come into being. For by\nmeans of calculation we will seek reconciliation in our dealings with\nothers. Through this, then, the poor receive from the powerful, and\nthe wealthy give to the needy, both in the confidence that they will\nhave what is fair on account of this.\n\nThis glorification of calculation is reminiscent of Plato\u2019s\npraise for \u201cgeometrical equality\u201d in the Gorgias\n(507e6\u2013508a8) and Plato may be thinking of Archytas Fr. 3\n(Palmer 2014: 205\u20136; Huffman 2013: 259\u201361). The emphasis\non equality (isotas) and fairness (to ison) suggests\nthat Archytas envisages rational calculation (logismos) as\nheavily mathematical. On the other hand, logismos is not\nidentical to the technical science of number (logistic \u2013 see 3.2\nabove) but is rather a practical ability to understand numerical\ncalculations, including basic proportions, an ability that is shared\nby most human beings. It is the clarity of calculation and proportion\nthat does away with the constant striving for more\n(pleonexia), which produces discord in the state. Since the\nstate is based on a widely shared human ability to calculate, an\nability that the rich and poor share, Archytas was led to support a\nmore democratic constitution (see 1.3 above) than Plato, who\nemphasizes the expert mathematical knowledge of a few (R.\n546a ff.). Zhmud (2006: 60\u201376) points out connections between B3\nand Isocrates and argues that Isocrates is referring to Archytas, when\nhe says that some praise the sciences for their utility and others try\nto demonstrate that they contribute greatly to virtue\n(Busiris 23). However, Archytas seems to accept both of these\nviews about the sciences, while Isocrates refers to two different\ngroups of people. Isocrates\u2019 reference is also very general and\nmakes no allusion to the central terms of B3 so that it is doubtful\nthat he has Archytas in mind. For further discussion of the argument\nof B3 see Huffman 2005: 182\u2013224 and Schofield 2008. \n\nMost of our evidence for Archytas\u2019 ethical views is,\nunfortunately, not based on fragments of his writings but rather on\nanecdotes, which probably ultimately derive from Aristoxenus\u2019\nLife of Archytas. The good life of the individual, no less\nthan the stability of the state, appears to have been founded on\nrational calculation. Aristoxenus presented a confrontation between\nthe Syracusan hedonist, Polyarchus, and Archytas. Polyarchus\u2019\nlong speech is preserved by Athenaeus and Archytas\u2019 response by\nCicero (A9 = Deip. 545a and Sen. XII 39\u201341\nrespectively). Schofield (2014: 70, n.2) raises doubts about whether\nCicero really preserves Archytas\u2019 response (See Huffman 2005:\n323\u201337). Horky (2011: 120) assumes without argument that\nAristoxenus presented Archytas as delivering his speech in the\npresence of Plato and the Samnite C. Pontius, but this is part of\nCicero\u2019s frame story and there is no evidence that it derives\nfrom Aristoxenus. Polyarchus\u2019 defense of always striving for\nmore (pleonexia) and of the pursuit of pleasure is\nreminiscent of Plato\u2019s presentations of Callicles and\nThrasymachus, but is not derived from those presentations and is\nbetter seen as an important parallel development (Huffman 2002b).\nArchytas bases his response on the premise that reason (= rational\ncalculation) is the best part of us and the part that should govern\nour actions. Polyarchus might grant such a premise, since his is a\nrational hedonism. Archytas responds once again with a thought\nexperiment. We are to imagine someone in the throes of the greatest\npossible bodily pleasure (sexual orgasm?). Surely we must agree that a\nperson in such a state is not able to engage in rational calculation.\nIt thus appears that bodily pleasure is in itself antithetical to\nreason and that, the more we succeed in obtaining it, the less we are\nable to reason. Aristotle appears to refer to this argument in the\nNicomachean Ethics (1152b16\u201318). Archytas\u2019\nargument is specifically directed against bodily pleasure and he did\nnot think that all pleasure was disruptive; he enjoyed playing with\nchildren (A8) and recognized that the pleasures of friendship were\npart of a good life (Cicero, Amic. XXIII 88). Other anecdotes\nemphasize that our actions must be governed by reason rather than the\nemotions: Archytas refused to punish the serious misdeeds of his\nslaves, because he had become angry and did not want to act out of\nanger (A7); he restrained himself from swearing aloud by writing his\ncurses on a wall instead (A11). Palmer argues that Archytas was\nworking with a Pythagorean conception of the soul as divided into two\nparts: the intellect and a part responsible for the affective states\nsuch as emotions and appetites (2014: 209). \n7. Importance and Influence\n\nArchytas fits the common stereotype of a Pythagorean better than\nanyone else does. He is by far the most accomplished Pythagorean\nmathematician, making important contributions to geometry,\nlogistic/arithmetic and harmonics. He was more successful as a\npolitical leader than any other ancient philosopher, and there is a\nrich anecdotal tradition about his personal self-control. It is\nstriking, however, that there are essentially no testimonia connecting\nArchytas to metempsychosis or the religious aspect of Pythagoreanism.\nArchytas is a prominent figure in the rebirth of interest in\nPythagoreanism in first century BC Rome: Horace, Propertius and Cicero\nall highlight him. As the last prominent member of the early\nPythagorean tradition, more pseudo-Pythagorean works came to be forged\nin his name than any other Pythagorean, including Pythagoras himself.\nHis name, with the spelling Architas, continued to exert power in\nMedieval and Renaissance texts, although the accomplishments assigned\nto him in those texts are fanciful.\n\nScholars have typically emphasized the continuities between Plato and\nArchytas (e.g., Kahn 2001, 56), but the evidence suggests that\nArchytas and Plato were in serious disagreement on a number of issues.\nPlato\u2019s only certain reference to Archytas is part of a\ncriticism of his approach to harmonics in Book VII of the\nRepublic, where there is probably also a criticism of his\nwork in solid geometry. Plato\u2019s attempt to argue for the split\nbetween the intelligible and sensible world in Books VI and VII of the\nRepublic may well be a protreptic directed at Archytas, who\nrefused to separate numbers from things. It is sometimes thought that\nthe eponymous primary speaker in Plato\u2019s Timaeus, who\nis described as a leading political figure and philosopher from\nsouthern Italy (20a), must be a stand-in for Archytas. The\nTimaeus, however, is a most un-Archytan document (Huffman\n2013: 263-8). It is based on the split between the sensible and\nintelligible world, which Archytas did not accept. Plato argues that\nthe universe is limited, while Archytas is famous for this argument to\nshow that it is unlimited. Plato constructs the world soul according\nto ratios that are important in harmonic theory, but he uses\nPhilolaus\u2019 ratios rather than Archytas\u2019. Plato does adopt\nArchytas\u2019 theory of pitch with some modification, but Archytas\nand Plato disagree on the explanation of sight. For a different view\nof the relation between Plato and Archytas see Kingsley 2014:\n156\u20137. Archytas\u2019 refusal to split the intelligible from\nthe sensible may have made him a more attractive figure to Aristotle,\nwho devoted four books to him (Huffman 2005: 583\u2013594) and\npraised his definitions for treating the composite of matter and form,\nnot of form separate from matter (Metaph. 1043a14\u201326).\nArchytas\u2019 vision of the role of mathematics in the state is\ncloser to Aristotle\u2019s mathematical account of distributive and\nredistributive justice (EN 1130b30 ff.) than to Plato\u2019s\nemphasis on the expert mathematical knowledge of the guardians.\nClearly Archytas was an important influence on both Plato and\nAristotle, but the exact nature of those philosophical relationships\nis complex.",
