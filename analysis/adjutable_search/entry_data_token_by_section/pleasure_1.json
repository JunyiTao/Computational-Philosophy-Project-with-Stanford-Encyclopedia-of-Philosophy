    "main_text": "A Feature of Momentary Experience || Pleasure as a Simple but Powerful Feeling\n1.1 Pleasure as a Simple but Powerful Feeling\n\nPleasure most commonly backgrounds the experience of someone cheerful\nby temperament or in a good mood. Such baseline affect and small\ndeviations from it cumulatively matter most to the affective quality\nof life (Watson\u00a02000; Diener, Sandvik, and Pavot \u00a01991; cf.\nCoan and Allen 2003, Rachels 2004). That pleasure includes these has\nbeen prominently noted (e.g.: Duncker, 1941, 404; Alston, 1967, 341;\nGosling, 1969, 135 ff.) but often slips from mind. Exclusive focus on\nsalient episodes with acute onset caused by typically pleasant\nstimulation, as from sweets and caresses, may mislead one to think\nsuch episodes or sensations are the main topic of hedonic discussion\nor to misread others as making this mistake.\n\nPleasure neither easily fits, nor has been widely thought by theorists\nto fit, the standard paradigms of sensation, whether of qualities of\noutward things or of those of either localized or diffuse bodily\nsensation, since it seems any typically pleasant sensory state or\nquality may be enjoyed less or even not at all on occasions, while its\nsensory quality and intensity remain much the same (Ryle 1949, p. 109;\n1954a, p. 58; 1954b, p. 136). The pleasantness of tastes is modulated\nby nutritional state and experience (Young 1959, Cabanac 1971, Bolles\n1991). And differences in mood, temperament, personal history, and how\none feels toward a particular person in a specific social context may\nmake all the difference between feeling great pleasure or great\ndistress from what seems the same sensation of touch (cf. Helm 2000\npp. 93\u201394; 2002, pp.\u00a023\u201324). Both science and\nreflection on everyday experience thus distinguish mere\nsensation proper from hedonic reaction (cf. Aydede 2000). Allowing\nthat there may be \u2018sensations of pleasure\u2019, its\noccasionally accompanying somatic symptoms, is consistent with this\ndistinction between sensation, narrowly conceived, and affective\nresponse. John Locke\u2019s (1700/1979, II, xx, 1) picture of\npleasure and pain as \u201csimple ideas\u201d learned and understood\n\u201conly by experience\u201d of \u201cwhat we feel in\nourselves\u201d, distinguishable from any \u201csensation barely in\nitself\u201d they may accompany, seems consistent with this\ndistinction between affective feeling and sensation proper made more\nprominently\n later.[2]\n\nLocke and many of his time and tradition seem to have held views close\nto the simple picture of pleasure (of this entry\u2019s\nsecond introductory paragraph), joined to an empiricist picture of our\nconcepts of pleasure and good as similarly simple because acquired\nfrom the simple experience of pleasure. Their view that pleasure is an\n(at least cognitively) isolable conscious event or feature has\ncounterparts among those ancient hedonist materialist philosophers who\nthought of pleasure as some smooth or gentle stimulation, motion, or\nphysiological change (see Gosling and Taylor 1982, pp.\u00a041, 394)\nand also among those nowadays who regard it as some short-term\nactivity of the brain. Hedonist views that explain human value,\nmotivation, and concepts of good and evil in terms of such supposedly\nsimple affective feelings of pleasure and pain (e.g., Locke 1700/1979,\nEssay II, xx and xxi, 31 ff.) were also widespread,\nespecially among writers in English, in the following two centuries.\nPleasure was widely taken for granted as foundational in this way by\nthe nascent behavioral and social sciences, until more demanding\nstandards, first for stricter introspection and later for more\nobjective (in this use: not based in experimental subjects\u2019\njudgments on the topic) methods, were\n adopted.[3]\n\n",
