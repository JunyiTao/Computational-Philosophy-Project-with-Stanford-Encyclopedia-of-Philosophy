    "main_text": "\n\n\u201cThe problem of universals\u201d in general is a historically\nvariable bundle of several closely related, yet in different\nconceptual frameworks rather differently articulated metaphysical,\nlogical, and epistemological questions, ultimately all connected to\nthe issue of how universal cognition of singular things is possible.\nHow do we know, for example, that the Pythagorean theorem holds\nuniversally, for all possible right triangles?\nIndeed, how can we have any awareness of a potential infinity of all\npossible right triangles, given that we could only see a finite number\nof actual ones? How can we universally indicate all possible right\ntriangles with the phrase \u2018right triangle\u2019? Is there\nsomething common to them all signified by this phrase? If so, what is\nit, and how is it related to the particular right triangles? The\nmedieval problem of universals is a logical, and historical,\ncontinuation of the ancient problem generated by\nPlato\u2019s (428\u2013348 B.C.E.) theory answering such a bundle of\nquestions, namely, his theory of Ideas or Forms.\n",
