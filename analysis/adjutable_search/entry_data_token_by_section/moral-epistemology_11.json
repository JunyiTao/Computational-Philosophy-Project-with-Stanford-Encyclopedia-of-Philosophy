    "main_text": "Methodological: Epistemology Naturalized, Reflective Equilibrium, Rational Choice, and Pragmatic Naturalism || Reflective Equilibrium and Rational Choice\n5.2 Reflective Equilibrium and Rational Choice\n\n\nTwo allied methodologies need to be mentioned that arose along side\nof naturalized epistemology in the last century. Goodman introduced the\nconcept of a reflective equilibrium in addressing the problem of\njustifying induction (Goodman 1955). Rules of inference would be\nformulated to explain what one takes to be valid scientific reasoning,\nmuch as one might formulate deductive inference rules to explain valid\ninferences of mathematicians. Application of these rules may, however,\nyield conclusions that are contrary to one\u2019s considered judgment in a\ngiven case. Then a choice is necessary between revising one\u2019s judgment\nto bring it into line with the systematic implications of the other\nspecific judgments, or else revising the rules (with the possible\nconsequence that a similar problem will arise in another quarter). One\nproceeds until reaching (for the time being) a reflective equilibrium\nin considered judgments, including judgments about the rules that best\nexplain one\u2019s inferences. The proposed methodology is like that of\nnaturalized epistemology. It begins by taking for granted, at least\ninitially, that the methods of science are sound and then attempts to\nformulate the principles that explain it by working within science,\nrevising the principles or the practice as necessary to achieve a more\ncoherent overall understanding. A significant difference is that the\nmethod seeks explicitly to arrive at acceptable normative\nprinciples.\n\n\nRawls self-consciously applies the concept of reflective equilibrium\nin explaining the method of justification underlying his theory of\nsocial justice (Rawls 1971). Rawls applies the methodology, of course,\nto justify considered moral judgments found outside of science.\nHowever, he takes no judgments to be established simply a priori. The\nclaims about justice are justified in part by their implications when\ntaken together with what we assume to be known in psychological,\nsocial, and economic theory. Others have elaborated this methodology\nso that a \u201cwide reflective equilibrium\u201d would be reached\nonly after consideration of relevant background assumptions, regarding\nsuch things as personal identity and rational choice, as well as\nrelevant alternative theories (Daniels 1976). Still others argue that\nwide reflective equilibrium reasoning should not be confused with a\ndifferent but complementary reasoning that directly compares opposing\nmoral judgments about particular but similar cases without reference\nto general principles. Moral consistency reasoning, as it is called,\ncan support but it can also undermine wide reflective equilibrium\nreasoning. Both may be needed to reach morally defensible conclusions\n(Campbell 2014).\n\n\nA complication is that the justification of moral claims in Rawls\nproceeds also by arguing that rational persons in a hypothetical\n\u201coriginal position\u201d of freedom and equality would be rational to choose\ncertain principles of social justice. Though in this appeal to rational\nchoice Rawls is explicitly engaged in a social contract theory of\njustice and thus a particular type of normative theory, the\nimplications are more general. The larger suggestion is that moral\ntruth is based significantly on which moral norms can be rationally\nchosen by members of a given society as norms under which they would be\nprepared to live. (Compare the accounts of moral truth in Brandt 1979,\nCopp 1995, and Braybrooke 2001, none of which defend social contract\ntheory, but all of which base moral truth on rational choice. Gauthier\n1986 appeals to rational choice to determine which moral norms are\njustified but without supposing that moral judgments have truth\nvalue.)\n\n\nThe methodology of basing moral truth on rational choice and the\nmethodology of invoking the ideal of a reflective equilibrium of\nconsidered judgments both endeavor to square moral knowledge with a\nscientific world view and as such are allied with naturalized\nepistemology. Both, however, explicitly make room for normative claims\nand so avoid the charge that the normative dimension is missing from\ntheir account of moral knowledge. Unfortunately they face the charge of\nmaking moral truth more likely than not to reflect the moral status quo.\nLet us allow that a person may come to revise many beliefs, including\nmany moral beliefs, before reaching a wide reflective equilibrium in\njudgments. Why should we think that the most stubborn moral judgments\nin a given reflective equilibrium are more likely to be true than the\nones that gave way to them in the process of reaching a reflective\nequilibrium (Copp 1985)? The reply may be that this approach is no\nworse off than naturalized epistemology, since we must take some moral\nclaims for granted, at least tentatively, and proceed until there is\nreason to revise our judgments given their lack of fit with everything\nelse we think we know. Moral conservatism is also a problem for the\nmethodology that bases moral truth on rational choice, since rational\nchoice turns on individual preferences and these are inevitably shaped\nby the moral status quo (Babbitt 1996 and Campbell 1998).\n",
