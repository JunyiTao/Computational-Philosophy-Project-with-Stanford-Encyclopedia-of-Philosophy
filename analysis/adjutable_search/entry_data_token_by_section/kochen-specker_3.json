    "main_text": "Statement and Proof of the KS Theorem || A Quick KS Argument in Four Dimensions (Cabello et al.)\n3.2 A Quick KS Argument in Four Dimensions (Cabello et al.)\n\n\nA particularly easy KS argument proceeds in a four-dimensional Hilbert\nspace H4. We will use the following, which will be proved\nin the next section: \n\n\n(1) From KS2 we can derive a constraint on value assignments to\nprojection operators, namely that for every set of projection\noperators P1, P2,\nP3, P4, corresponding to the\nfour distinct eigenvalues q1,\nq2, q3, q4\nof an observable Q on H4 the following holds:\n(VC1\u2032)\u00a0\u00a0\nv(P1) +\nv(P2) +\nv(P3) +\nv(P4) = 1, where\nv(Pi) = 1 or 0, for i =\n1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n\n((VC1\u2032) is a variant of (VC1) which\nwe prove explicitly in the next section.) This means in effect that\nof every set of four orthogonal rays in H4 exactly one is assigned\nthe number 1, the others 0.\n\n\n(2) Although the Hilbert space mentioned in the theorem, in order to\nbe suited for QM, must be complex, it is enough, in order to\nshow the inconsistency of claims KS1 and KS2, to consider a\nreal Hilbert space of the same dimension. So, instead of H4\nwe consider a real Hilbert space R4 and translate VC1\u2032 into the\nrequirement: Of every set of orthogonal rays in R4, exactly one is\nassigned the number 1 and the others 0. As usual in the literature, we\ntranslate all this into the following colouring problem: Of every\nset of orthogonal rays in R4 exactly one must be coloured white, the\nothers black. This, however, is impossible, as is shown\nimmediately by the following table (Cabello et al. 1996):\n\n\n0,0,0,1\n0,0,0,1\n1,\u22121,1,\u22121\n1,\u22121,1,\u22121\n0,0,1,0\n1,\u22121,\u22121,1\n1,1,\u22121,1\n1,1,\u22121,1\n1,1,1,\u22121\n\n\n0,0,1,0\n0,1,0,0\n1,\u22121,\u22121,1\n1,1,1,1,\n0,1,0,0\n1,1,1,1\n1,1,1,\u22121\n\u22121,1,1,1\n\u22121,1,1,1\n\n\n1,1,0,0\n1,0,1,0\n1,1,0,0\n1,0,\u22121,0\n1,0,0,1\n1,0,0,\u22121\n1,\u22121,0,0\n1,0,1,0\n1,0,0,1\n\n\n1,\u22121,0,0\n1,0,\u22121,0\n0,0,1,1\n0,1,0,\u22121\n1,0,0,\u22121\n0,1,\u22121,0\n0,0,1,1\n0,1,0,\u22121\n0,1,\u22121,0\n\n\n\n\nThere are 4 x 9 = 36 entries in this table. These entries are taken\nfrom a set of 18 rays and every ray appears twice.  It is easy\nto verify that every column in the table represents a set of four\northogonal rays.  Since there are 9 columns, we must end up\nwith an odd number of the table\u2019s entries coloured\nwhite. However, since every ray appears twice any time we colour one\nof them white, we commit ourselves to colouring an even number of the\nentries white. It follows that the total number of table entries\ncoloured white must be even, not odd. Thus, a colouring of\nthese 18 rays in accordance with VC1\u2032 is impossible.  (Note for\nfuture reference that the first part of the argument \u2014 the\nargument for \u2018odd\u2019 \u2014 uses only VC1\u2032, while\nthe second \u2014 the argument for \u2018even\u2019 \u2014 relies\nessentially on NC, by assuming that occurrences of the same ray in\ndifferent columns are assigned the same number!)\n",
