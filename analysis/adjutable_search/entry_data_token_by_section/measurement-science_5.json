    "main_text": "Mathematical Theories of Measurement (\u201cMeasurement Theory\u201d) || The measurability of sensation\n3.3 The measurability of sensation\n\nOne of the main catalysts for the development of mathematical theories\nof measurement was an ongoing debate surrounding measurability in\npsychology. The debate is often traced back to Gustav Fechner\u2019s\n(1860) Elements of Psychophysics, in which he described a\nmethod of measuring intensities of sensation. Fechner\u2019s method\nwas based on the recording of \u201cjust noticeable\ndifferences\u201d between sensations associated with pairs of\nstimuli, e.g., two sounds of different intensity. These differences\nwere assumed to be equal increments of intensity of sensation. As\nFechner showed, under this assumption a stable linear relationship is\nrevealed between the intensity of sensation and the logarithm of the\nintensity of the stimulus, a relation that came to be known as\n\u201cFechner\u2019s law\u201d (Heidelberger 1993a: 203; Luce and\nSuppes 2004: 11\u20132). This law in turn provides a method for\nindirectly measuring the intensity of sensation by measuring the\nintensity of the stimulus, and hence, Fechner argued, provides\njustification for measuring intensities of sensation on the real\nnumbers.\n\nFechner\u2019s claims concerning the measurability of sensation\nbecame the subject of a series of debates that lasted nearly a century\nand proved extremely fruitful for the philosophy of measurement,\ninvolving key figures such as Mach, Helmholtz, Campbell and Stevens\n(Heidelberger 1993a: Ch. 6 and 1993b; Michell 1999: Ch. 6). Those\nobjecting to the measurability of sensation, such as Campbell,\nstressed the necessity of an empirical concatenation operation for\nfundamental measurement. Since intensities of sensation cannot be\nconcatenated to each other in the manner afforded by lengths and\nweights, there could be no fundamental measurement of sensation\nintensity. Moreover, Campbell claimed that none of the psychophysical\nregularities discovered thus far are sufficiently universal to count\nas laws in the sense required for derived measurement (Campbell in\nFerguson et al. 1940: 347). All that psychophysicists have shown is\nthat intensities of sensation can be consistently ordered, but order\nby itself does not yet warrant the use of numerical relations such as\nsums and ratios to express empirical results.\n\nThe central opponent of Campbell in this debate was Stevens, whose\ndistinction between types of measurement scale was discussed above.\nStevens defined measurement as the \u201cassignment of numerals to\nobjects or events according to rules\u201d (1951: 1) and claimed that\nany consistent and non-random assignment counts as measurement in the\nbroad sense (1975: 47). In useful cases of scientific inquiry, Stevens\nclaimed, measurement can be construed somewhat more narrowly as a\nnumerical assignment that is based on the results of matching\noperations, such as the coupling of temperature to mercury volume or\nthe matching of sensations to each other. Stevens argued against the\nview that relations among numbers need to mirror qualitative empirical\nstructures, claiming instead that measurement scales should be\nregarded as arbitrary formal schemas and adopted in accordance with\ntheir usefulness for describing empirical data. For example, adopting\na ratio scale for measuring the sensations of loudness, volume and\ndensity of sounds leads to the formulation of a simple linear relation\namong the reports of experimental subjects: loudness = volume \u00d7\ndensity (1975: 57\u20138). Such assignment of numbers to sensations\ncounts as measurement because it is consistent and non-random, because\nit is based on the matching operations performed by experimental\nsubjects, and because it captures regularities in the experimental\nresults. According to Stevens, these conditions are together\nsufficient to justify the use of a ratio scale for measuring\nsensations, despite the fact that \u201csensations cannot be\nseparated into component parts, or laid end to end like measuring\nsticks\u201d (1975: 38; see also Hempel 1952: 68\u20139).\n",
