    "main_text": "Central Results || Social diversity\n4.4 Social diversity\n\nAs we have seen in\n Section 2.4,\n ABMs were introduced to study two issues that concern social\ndiversity in the context of science: first, epistemic effects of\nsocially diverse scientific groups, and second, factors that can\nundermine social diversity or disadvantage members of minorities in\nscience.\n\nConcerning the former question, Fazelpour and Steel (2022) developed a\nnetwork epistemology bandit model (see\n Section 3.2)\n to study effects of social (or demographic) diversity on collective\ninquiry. The model examines how different degrees of trust between\nsocially distinct sub-groups impact the performance of the scientific\ncommunity. The simulations show that social diversity can improve\ngroup inquiry by reducing the excessive trust scientists may place in\neach other\u2019s findings. This is particularly relevant in cases of\ndifficult inquiry in tightly connected communities, where a high\ndegree of trust may lead to a premature endorsement of an objectively\nfalse hypothesis. The authors also demonstrate how social diversity\ncan counteract negative effects of conformity in the choice of\nresearch paths, under the condition that the tendency to conform\nisn\u2019t too high. Using a similar bandit framework, Wu (2023)\nexamines how a marginalized group learns in environments in which\nmembers of the dominant group ignore or devalue results coming from\nthe former. She shows that in such situations, members of the\nmarginalized group can achieve an epistemic advantage in the sense of\nforming more accurate beliefs than the members of the dominant group.\nIn this way, the model aims to explain the \u201cinversion\nthesis\u201d from standpoint epistemology, according to which\nmarginalized groups may have an epistemically privileged status (Wylie\n2003).\n\nWith regard to the latter question, we previously mentioned the model\nby Rubin and Schneider (2021), which shows how minority members can\nbecome disadvantaged due to the priority rule in science and the\nstructure of the scientific community\n (Section 4.1).\n In a follow-up model, Rubin (2022) demonstrates how the\norganizational structure of the scientific community can also\ninfluence the emergence of \u201ccitation gaps\u201d, where\npublications by members of underrepresented and minority groups are\ncited less than those by members of the majority. The impact of one\u2019s\nminority status on one\u2019s position in scientific collaborations was\nmainly studied by means of evolutionary game-theoretic models of\nbargaining (see\n Section 3.4).\n The models show different ways in which minorities can become\ndiscriminated against merely due to their minority status and the\nimpact of such a status on the bargaining and collaborative practices\n(Rubin & O\u2019Connor 2018; O\u2019Connor & Bruner 2019;\nVentura 2023). Moreover, the results show that such an outcome may\nhave a negative impact on scientific progress, and it may help to\nexplain why gender and racial minorities tend to cluster in academic\nsubdisciplines (O\u2019Connor & Bruner 2019; Rubin &\nO\u2019Connor 2018). We will revisit these models below in\n Section 4.7,\n devoted to the issue of scientific collaboration.\n",
