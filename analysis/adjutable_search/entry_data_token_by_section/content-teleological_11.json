    "main_text": "Problems for Teleosemantics || Liberalism\n4.3 Liberalism\n\nComplete teleosemantic theories not only say how the content of a\nstate R is determined, given that R is a representation (thereby\nanswering the content-determination question), they also say what it\ntakes for R to qualify as a representation in the first place (thereby\nanswering the representational status question). Hence, such theories\nentail claims about which systems count as possessing representational\nstates, and which do not. Accordingly, they can be criticized as\nbeing too restrictive or too liberal (or as too\nrestrictive in certain respects and too liberal in others). The\nSwampman objection, for example, aims to show that standard\nteleosemantic theories are too restrictive in one respect, since they\nentail that Swampman does not qualify as a representational system,\neven though he should.\n\nOther theorists have criticized standard teleosemantics as being too\nliberal. A very influential objection along these lines has been\nraised by Tyler Burge (2010, 303\u2013307, 315\u2013319; 2014; see also Rescorla\n2013). Burge starts from the assumption that a theory of\nrepresentation should attribute representational states to a system\nonly if such attributions have genuine explanatory value (due to the\nfact that they can figure in distinctively psychological\nexplanations). He then argues that teleosemantic theories, as well as\nall other naturalistic (\u201cdeflationary\u201d) theories,\nattribute representational states to very simple organisms, e.g. to\nplants, protists and bacteria, where it is clear that such\nattributions have no explanatory value. This leads him to conclude\nthat teleosemantic theories invariably attribute representational\nstates \u201ctoo broadly\u201d \u2013 or, in other words, that\nteleosemantic theories are too \n liberal.[22]\n\n\nNow, Burge is certainly right in claiming that many prominent\nteleosemantic theories are very liberal in attributing\nrepresentational states. Millikan\u2019s biosemantics, for instance,\narguably entails that all living beings are representational systems.\nShea\u2019s theory is not quite as liberal, but it still seems to\nimply that many plants, protists and bacteria qualify as having\nrepresentations (see \n section 3.5). \n Hence, it is no surprise that many\nproponents of teleosemantics seek to defend representational\nliberalism against Burge\u2019s criticism. Artiga (2016), for\ninstance, who endorses a radical liberalism along Millikanian lines,\naims to show that Burge\u2019s case against the explanatory value of\nrepresentational characterizations of simple organisms begs the\nquestion against teleosemantics (for discussion, cf. Schulte 2019a),\nand he also gives a positive argument for the value of such\ncharacterizations in his \n (2021).[23]\n In a similar vein, Shea (2018) argues at length that his (moderately)\nliberal theory allows us to make sense of the explanatory role of\ncontent attributions in cognitive science. \n\nOther theorists have challenged Burge\u2019s assumption that they are\ncommitted to some form of representational liberalism. Schulte (2015)\nstarts from Burge\u2019s (2010) positive thesis that it is the\npossession of sensory systems with constancy mechanisms (e.g. size\nconstancy, color constancy, shape constancy or motion constancy) that\nmarks the distinction between representational and\nnon-representational organisms. If that is right, Schulte argues, then\nthere is a natural way for proponents of teleosemantics to incorporate\nthat insight into their account: they can require producers of sensory\nrepresentations to be systems with constancy mechanisms (where this is\nspelled out in a naturalistic \n way)[24] \n and maintain that non-sensory representations presuppose the\nexistence of sensory \n ones.[25]\n By Burge\u2019s own standards, such a theory would not be\ntoo liberal. An alternative non-liberal version of teleosemantics has\nbeen proposed by Butlin (2020a): he argues that sensory\nrepresentations need not satisfy Schulte\u2019s constancy-mechanism\nrequirement as long as they have an \u2018active consumer\u2019,\ni.e. a consumer system where distinct processes are responsible for\ngenerating behavior and for coordinating behavior with environmental\nconditions.\n",
