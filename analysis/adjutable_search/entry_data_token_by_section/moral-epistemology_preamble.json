    "main_text": "\n\n\nHow is moral knowledge possible? This question is central in moral\nepistemology and marks a cluster of problems. The most important are\nthe following.\n\nSociological: The best explanation of the depth of moral\ndisagreements and the social diversity that they reflect is one of two\nthings. (a) No moral facts exist to be known, since moral disagreements\nexemplify merely clashes in moral sensibility rather than differences\nabout matters of fact. (b) Moral knowledge exists, but moral facts are\nrelative to the social group in which moral sensibility is formed with\nthe result that no moral truths are known to hold universally.\nPsychological: Moral judgments are intrinsically motivating.\nJudgments about matters of fact, on the other hand, are never\nmotivating just in themselves. Since to constitute moral knowledge a\nmoral judgment must be made about some moral fact, moral knowledge is\nnot possible.\nOntological: Moral knowledge is about moral reality. How is that\nreality constituted? Three general possibilities present themselves.\n(a) Moral reality might be theological in nature, pertaining to (say)\nthe will of God. (b) It might be a non-natural realm that is neither\ntheological nor natural, but sui generis. (c) It might be\ncomprehensible as a part of the natural world studied by science. Each\nof these possibilities, however, is beset with difficulties, and no\nviable fourth alternative has been conceived.\nEvolutionary: Where do human morals come from? A familiar and\nwidely accepted answer is that human morals are in essence, despite\ntheir modern variations, Darwinian adaptations. As such morals are\nabout survival and reproduction and have nothing to do with moral\ntruth. Moreover, while the intuitive, emotional basis of moral\njudgments was useful to our ancestors, this basis is out-dated and\nunreliable in modern industrial society and thus current moral thought\nin such society, which inevitably embeds this basis, is without\nrational foundation.\nMethodological: Traditionally philosophers have sought to explain\nthe possibility of knowledge by appeal to at least some principles\nthat can be grasped and defended a priori and thus independently of\nnatural science. A new and revolutionary epistemology introduced by\nQuine seeks to explain the possibility of knowledge through science\nitself.  \u201cNaturalized epistemology\u201d has been immensely\npopular since its inception in the 1960s, largely because it promises\nto make epistemology consistent with a scientific world-view. At the\nsame time the new methodology appears to make it more difficult to\nexplain the possibility of moral knowledge. Two allied methodologies\nthat seek to find moral truth in a reflective equilibrium of judgments\nor in applications of rational choice theory are much less restrictive\nbut open to the objection that they are morally conservative. A recent\nmethodology allied to naturalized epistemology is pragmatic\nnaturalism. Taking its inspiration from examples of transforming the\nmoral status quo, it is less vulnerable to the charge of moral\nconservatism. However, by understanding moral knowledge as mainly a\nmatter of knowing how to live well interdependently with others by\nresolving issues collectively as they arise, this methodology may not\noffer a conception of moral truth appropriate to genuine moral\nknowledge.\nMoral: Feminists among others are often critical of traditional\nepistemologies as well as the innovative recent methodologies on the\nmoral ground that the standards found there are unjustly biased\nagainst women and other marginalized groups. For example, feminists\noften reject the standard of impartiality contained in these forms of\nepistemology because it renders invisible important knowledge\npossessed by women and thereby contributes to their oppression. If,\nfor reasons to be given, the criticism has merit, then it presents an\napparent paradox within feminist moral epistemology, since it appears\nto reject the ideal of impartiality on the ground that it is not\nitself impartial. The Marxist complaint that the standard of\nimpartiality is unjustly biased against the working class because it\nrenders invisible their exploitation gives rise to the same\ncontradiction. Resolution of the paradox is important for both\nevaluating such criticisms and understanding in general how to\nevaluate moral criticisms of epistemic standards. \n\n\nArguably, these issues, as central and broad as they are, do not cover\nall of moral epistemology. To keep the subject manageable, this entry\nis limited in the following five ways.\n\n\nFirst, the entry ignores global skepticism, which doubts the\npossibility of anyone\u2019s having any knowledge at all. Thus, it ignores\nthe threat of an unstoppable regress in justifications and Cartesian\nevil demon scenarios. Nor does it take up the debates between\nfoundationalists and coherentists about the structure of\njustification. These issues (with an exception to be noted) do not\nraise problems special to moral epistemology. But see the entry for\nMoral Skepticism.\n\n\nSecond, in keeping with the last restriction, the entry takes for granted\nthat our capacity to have other kinds of knowledge is not in question.\nIndeed, the six problems above arise in part because of the\nimplications of having other kinds of knowledge.\n\n\nThird, the entry assumes that moral knowledge entails (roughly)\njustified true moral belief. This assumption commits me to the\nposition that moral knowledge is incompatible with non-cognitivism\n(the view that moral claims lack cognitive value, such as\ntruth-value). A non-cognitivist, however, may seek to explain how the\nattitudes or prescriptions expressed in moral claims are\njustified. (See Hare 1981, Campbell 1985, Gibbard 1990, and Blackburn\n1998 for theories of moral justification compatible with\nnon-cognitivism and the entry on\n moral skepticism\n for a discussion of moral justification in general.) Indeed, an\nexpressivist may invoke a deflationary conception of truth to support\nthe idea that we can speak of justified moral beliefs that are \u201ctrue\u201d\n\u2014 without implying that justified moral beliefs accurately\nrepresent moral reality. Moral justification is discussed below,\nhowever, only as it pertains to putatively reliable representations of\nmoral reality.\n\n\nFourth, many important epistemological issues arise in the context of\nconsidering specific normative theories or types of normative\ntheory. (Can virtue ethics explain how we can know what course of\naction is morally acceptable for a situation demanding the exercise of\nconflicting virtues?) The focus in this entry is on issues that are\nspecial to moral epistemology but not tied to a particular type of\nnormative theory. The feminist criticism cited, though it arises from\nspecific normative concerns, is no exception, since it raises general\nworries about how moral knowledge is possible.\n\n\nFifth, the discussion of the history of moral epistemology is limited\nto philosophers, such as Kant and Hume, who have had the most to say\nabout these issues and whose responses have been most\ninfluential. Other historical positions and additional analysis of the\npossibility of a priori moral knowledge will be covered in other SEP\nentries.\n\n\nMy plan is to examine in turn each of the six clusters of challenges\nto the possibility of moral knowledge in Sections 1\u20136 and then, in\nSections 7\u201310, to reflect on the underlying assumption that moral\nknowledge consists in the justified true moral belief of a single\nindividual.\n\n",
