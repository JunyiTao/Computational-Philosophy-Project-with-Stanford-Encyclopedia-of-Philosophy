    "main_text": "The Person\n1. The Person\n\n\nBrouwer studied at the (municipal) University of Amsterdam where his\nmost important teachers were Diederik Korteweg and Gerrit Mannoury.\n\nKorteweg (1848\u20131941) was professor of mathematics, mechanics and\nastronomy at the University of Amsterdam from 1881\u20131918; the\nlast five years as extraordinarius, so as to make place for\nBrouwer. Around 1900, Korteweg was the most important and influential\nmathematician in the Netherlands, and he contributed much to the\ninternationalisation of Dutch mathematics. A mathematical physicist\ntrained by van der Waals, he had a particular interest in mechanics\nand thermodynamics. Among his many results, the best-known is probably\nthe Korteweg-de Vries equation, describing the behaviour of waves in a\nshallow channel. Korteweg also had a strong historical interest, and\nwas chief editor of vols. XI\u2013XV of Christiaan Huygens\u2019 collected\nworks (1908\u20131925). Part of the correspondence with his PhD\nstudent Brouwer concerned the unification of physical theories (see\nvan Stigt, 1990, pp. 490\u2013498).\n\n\nMannoury (1867\u20131956) was a philosopher, mathematician,\npsychoanalyst, accountant, and political activist (Kirkels, 2019). Largely an\nautodidact, it was he who introduced in the Netherlands both topology\n(in a series of papers of 1897\u20131900) and Peano\u2019s symbolic logic\n(in a lecture in 1903). In 1903 he was\nappointed privaatdocent (unpaid lecturer) in the logical\nfoundations of mathematics at the University of Amsterdam, where\nBrouwer was among his first and most enthusiastic students. His\nlectures have been published, in shortened and revised form, as\nMannoury, 1909. But it was Mannoury\u2019s earlier, topological papers that\ninfluenced the young Brouwer decisively: the \u201cundertone\u201d\nof that work, Brouwer said in a speech in 1946, had changed his view\nof mathematics from a collection of \u201ctruths fascinating by their\nimmovability, but horrifying by their lifelessness, like stones from\nbarren mountains of disconsolate infinity\u201d to a concern with\nwhat is \u201cbuilt ... out of the structural elements of our\nthinking\u201d (Brouwer, 1946B, pp. 192\u2013193). Brouwer was also\nvery interested in Mannoury\u2019s reflections on the uses and misuses of\nlanguage in mathematics and philosophy. In 1917 Mannoury became\nprofessor extraordinarius, in 1918 ordinarius at the\nUniversity of Amsterdam, succeeding Korteweg at the chair of analytic\nand descriptive geometry, mechanics and philosophy of mathematics,\nuntil 1937. A large part of his career was devoted to furthering the\ndevelopment of significs, an analysis of communicative acts\nstarting from the ideas laid down by Victoria, Lady Welby in her paper\n\u201cSense, Meaning and Interpretation\u201d (Welby, 1896). Brouwer\nwas also involved in that project.\n\nBrouwer\u2019s principal (intuitionistic) students were Maurits Belinfante,\nArend Heyting, and Johan de Iongh; Heyting, in turn, was the teacher\nof Anne Troelstra and Dirk van Dalen, and de Iongh of Wim\nVeldman. Brouwer\u2019s classes were also attended by Max Euwe, later to\nbecome world chess champion, who published a game-theoretical paper on\nchess from the intuitionistic point of view (Euwe, 1929), and who\nwould much later deliver Brouwer\u2019s funeral speech. Among Brouwer\u2019s\nassistants were Heyting, Hans Freudenthal, Karl Menger, and Witold\nHurewicz, the latter two of whom were not intuitionistically\ninclined. The most influential supporter of Brouwer\u2019s intuitionism\noutside the Netherlands at the time was, for a number of years,\nHermann Weyl (whose adaptation of intuitionistic analysis was not\nwholly coherent); also Husserl\u2019s student Oskar Becker should be\nmentioned.\n\n\nBrouwer seems to have been an independent and brilliant man of high\nmoral standards, but with an exaggerated sense of justice, making him\nat times pugnacious. As a consequence, in his life he energetically\nfought many battles. To Mannoury\u2019s daughter, Brouwer once said:\n\u201cIndeed, your father is one of the few people with whom I have\nnever had a quarrel. But he brought out the good in people, and I the\nbad\u201d (Schmitz, 1990, p. 383).\n\n\nFrom 1914 to 1928, Brouwer was member of the editiorial board of the\nMathematische Annalen, and he was the founding editor of\nCompositio Mathematica, which first appeared in 1934.\n\n\nHe was a member of, among others, the Royal Dutch Academy of\nSciences, the Royal Society in London, the Preu\u00dfische Akademie\nder Wissenschaften in Berlin, and the Akademie der Wissenschaften in\nG\u00f6ttingen.\n\n\nBrouwer received honorary doctorates from the universities of Oslo\n(1929) and Cambridge (1954), and was made Knight in the Order of the\nDutch Lion in 1932.\n",
