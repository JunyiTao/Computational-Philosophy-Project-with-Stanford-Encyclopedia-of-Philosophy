In particular, does it correlate to a natural right, to a\nlegal right, or to something else?\n\nBioethicists and human rights lawyers tend to assume that informed\nconsent is a natural right that generates a correlative objective\nmoral duty and, downstream, legal and institutional duties. Many\ncontemporary philosophers assume that consent has moral\n\u201cmagic\u201d that turns what would have been a wrongful action\ninto a right one, in an objective, moral sense (Hurd 1996). But some\nof the aforementioned justifications for informed consent better\nsupport other assumptions.\n\nFor example, the forward-looking trust rationale mentioned earlier can\nbe understood to mean that, morally, we should enshrine and then honor\nlegal (and cultural) informed consent requirements as a bulwark for\ntrust in medical practitioners. On that view, violating informed\nconsent requirements toward a patient does not necessarily violate\nthat patient\u2019s natural moral rights, only what are and\nmorally should remain everyone\u2019s legally protected\ninterests. \n\nIn a further model, the uniform requirement of informed consent across\ncircumstances reflects our sheer epistemological problem telling in\nadvance the typical circumstances when it objectively applies from\nrelative exceptions on which it does not (Wertheimer 2014, about the\nrequirement in intervention research; see also Alexander 2014). In a\nstill further model, the informed consent requirement only appears to\napply homogeneously across circumstances in the eyes of agents who\nhave cultivated, as morally they should, a fruitful yet false belief\nin the requirement\u2019s objectively homogeneous application (Eyal\n2015). In a final model, the justified legal standing of informed\nconsent bolsters its moral standing (Miller and Wertheimer 2010,\n82\u20133). \n\nOne reason to take non-naturalistic approaches to the status of\ninformed consent seriously is that not all natural rights are legally\nenforceable. Therefore, a moral informed consent right that is legally\nenforceable (as that right is usually taken to be in at least some\ninstitutional settings) may stand in need of additional moral\njustification, even if a natural right has been established. That\nadditional, inescapable moral justification may then turn out to\njustify informed consent regulations even absent natural informed\nconsent rights, say as trust-building measures. In particular, recall\nthat many bioethicists ground informed consent in duties to treat\nrational, autonomous persons respectfully. Some such duties are\nclearly non-enforceable. For example, the moral duty not to lie to\npersons in breach of their autonomous decision-making is seldom\nlegitimately enforceable. It is not the business of third parties to\nprevent me from disrespectfully and immorally lying to my friends.\nThus, additional justification would be needed, beyond simple appeal\nto respect for autonomy, in order to establish an enforceable informed\nconsent requirement. That inescapable additional moral justification\nmay turn out, if successful, to justify informed consent regulations\nand the surrounding ethos in full. It may do so even if the project of\ngrounding informed consent in autonomy, and all other attempts to\njustify natural informed consent rights, founder.\n",
