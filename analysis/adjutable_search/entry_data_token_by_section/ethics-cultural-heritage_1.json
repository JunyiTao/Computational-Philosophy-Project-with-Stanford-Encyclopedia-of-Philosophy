    "main_text": "What is Cultural Heritage? || What is Culture?\n1.1 What is Culture?\n\nDiscussions in the literature generally assume a broad understanding\nof culture that is often not explicitly defined (e.g., Thompson 2003;\nYoung 2007), but those definitions that do appear typically take the\nform of open-ended lists: culture is the product of human activity,\nparticularly those things that are socially transmitted, including\nbeliefs, practices, objects, etc. (Appiah 1994: 111\u2013112;\nScheffler 2007: 107). Culture is thus generally taken to be a\ndescriptive term that does not carry with it the evaluative and often\nelitist connotations of culture as implying a certain kind of\n\u201ccivilization\u201d (Appiah 1994: 111\u2013114). This\n\u201canthropological\u201d definition of culture is sometimes\ncriticized as overly broad, failing to discriminate between those\npractices (e.g.) that are worthwhile and those that are not (Logan\n2007: 37), but it remains the general touchstone in the literature.\nIndeed, culture is often treated as a \u201cgood\u201d thing in the\ncontext of the cultural heritage literature, despite the fact that\nsome cultural practices are subject to serious moral objections (Okin\n1997; Brown 2005: 50\u201351). In any event, though this anodyne\ndefinition of culture in general may be readily accepted, defining any\nparticular culture tends to be difficult and contentious (Scheffler\n2007; Appiah 2006; Narayan 1998). Proponents of cultural preservation\nor integrity are often accused of making misguided assumptions about\ncultures as static, bounded wholes that are empirically and\nnormatively flawed (e.g., Benhabib 2002; Mezey 2007). Indeed, these\ncriticisms surface in many arguments concerning heritage ethics, as\nwill be discussed in subsequent sections (see in particular\n 4.2.3).\n",
