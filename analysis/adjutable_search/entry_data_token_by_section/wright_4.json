    "main_text": "Interpretation of Darwin\n3. Interpretation of Darwin\n Wright was in advance of his contemporaries in his understanding\nof Darwin's change in organisms and species, in part because he\napplied the foregoing interpretation of science to Darwin's\ntheory. Wright highlighted the overall structure of the theory of\nevolution, which he believed illustrated the principle of utility. He\nalso characterized evolutionary change in terms of different levels of\ncausative and explanatory principles. Natural selection is a\ndescriptive principle that unifies these other principles in a\ncomprehensive account. It is a template, a form of explanation, by\nwhich an investigator may be guided in finding how more basic\nexplanatory principles \u2014 the principles of chemistry and the\nlaws of inheritance, for instance \u2014 issue in features of living\nthings observable by direct perception.\n\n\nWright said that natural selection is a manifestation of the\nall-pervasive principle of utility, which governs adaptation. Utility\nhe characterized in this way: \u201cLet the questions of the uses of\nlife, then, be put in this shape: To what ascertainable form or phase\nof life is this or that other form or phase of life valuable or\nserviceable?\u201d (L 274\u201375). Features or parts of a living\nthing are forms or phases of life that serve the organism's more\ngeneral functions and its survival. Perception of colors, for instance,\nserves to avoid the effects of dispersion of light in perception and to\nmake possible definition of objects in vision through limits in\nsensibility (L 279). Using teleological language without\nteleological intent, he said, \u201cColors were invented by Nature to\navoid the confusing effects of dispersion\u201d (L 279). The\nphysical laws of optics in this case lend themselves to an adaptation\nuseful to living things.\n\n\nTheorists of evolution are sometimes criticized for offering\n\u2018just so\u2019 stories of adaptation. How a given serviceable\nfeature might have evolved is taken as tantamount to how it actually\ndid evolve. There is, however, a valuable insight about the nature of\nevolutionary science to be gleaned from the practice of giving likely\nstories of evolution. The general form of explanation by utility is\nmore important than which particular explanation by natural selection\nis advanced to explain a feature or structure. At this very early\nstage of reception of Darwin's theory, Wright had already realized\nthis. In correspondence with Darwin, Wright said, \u201cThe inquiry\nas to which of several real uses is the one through which\nnatural selection has acted for the development of any faculty or\norgan \u2026 has for several years seemed to me a somewhat less\nimportant question than it seemed formerly and still appears to most\nthinkers on the subject\u201d (L 335). Wright thought there\nmight be a plurality of uses for the same feature in the history of an\norganism.  Sometimes these uses are contemporaneous; at other times\nthey succeed one another in the course of evolution. Wright believed\nthat thinking in terms of natural selection would shed light on\nphysiological questions and connect chemical and physical explanations\nto the more complicated phenomena of life (PD 296). He\nrealized that natural selection promised to be a research program for\ninvestigation that would unify biological science.\n\n\nWright strongly criticized Herbert Spencer's philosophy of\nevolution, both because of its excessive claims for the range of\nevolution and because of Spencer's understanding of evolution as a\nforce or operative cause. There is no Law of Evolution applicable to\nnature and civilization. Spencer's examples drawn from the history of\ncivilization are not truly scientific and are \u201cliable to the\ntaint of teleological and cosmological conception.\u201d (PD\n73). Wright said, \u201cTo us Mr. Spencer's speculation seems but the\nabstract statement of the cosmological conceptions, and that kind of\norderliness which the human mind spontaneously supplies in the absence\nof facts sufficiently numerous and precise to justify sound scientific\nconclusions\u201d (PD 73). In a review of a collection of\nessays by Alfred Wallace, the co-discoverer of the principle of natural\nselection, Wright said:\nStrictly speaking, Natural Selection is not a cause at all,\nbut is the mode of operation of a certain quite limited class of\ncauses. Natural Selection never made it come to pass, as a habit of\nnature, that an unsupported stone should move downwards rather than\nupwards. It applies to no part of inorganic nature, and is very limited\neven in the phenomena of organic life (PD 108).\n\n\nWright held that three different \u201cclasses of causes\u201d are\ninvolved in natural selection. The first has to do with the external\nconditions of the life of a living thing, its relation to other\norganisms and the non-organic world. Second are physical laws; he\nmentions specifically principles of mechanics, optics, and acoustics.\nThese are the best known and most basic of all the principles of\nscience. They are the principles by which means come to be fitted to\nends, the fulfilling or supplying of the needs of the organism. They\nare the laws in accordance with which an arm or wing, an eye or ear,\ncan be of use. Third are the causes introduced by Darwin, \u201cthe\nlittle known phenomena of variation, and their relations to the laws of\ninheritance\u201d (PD 142). He said there are several\ndivisions within this third class, distinguishing in particular\ndiversities always existing in a population from abnormal or unusual\nvariations. In responding to St. George Mivart's criticism of natural\nselection, he said that diversities existing normally in a population\nare the source of evolutionary change more than \u201cunusual and\nmonstrous variations\u201d (PD 144). Wright made this point\nboth to highlight the level at which natural selection operates and to\ndrive home the role of natural selection as an alternative to\nteleological explanations of the usefulness of adaptations. Variations\nin inherited characteristics in individuals are not themselves the\ndirect causes of changes in species. Natural selection is a complex\ngeneral fact of which utility is the organizing principle.\n\n\nWright's study of Mill's utilitarianism undoubtedly influenced his\nunderstanding of Darwin. Although he rejected Spencer's application of\nthe principle of evolution to history and civilization, he thought many\naspects of human behavior and psychology could be treated by the\nprinciple of natural selection. Utilitarian ethics provided a model for\nhim. He used the way humans make moral choices as an analogy for\nunconscious selection in the change of human language over time.\nUtility is not the motive of moral decision-makers. In the moral agent\nthinking rightly according to his principle of virtue, conscience will\ndisplay the utilitarian principle. Similarly, there may be a variety of\nmotives for adoption of a change in linguistic form or behavior:\nauthority, ease of pronunciation, or distinctness from other\nutterances. The adoption of the change is what concerns natural\nselection. Natural selection shows the utility implicit unconsciously\nin selection by the agency of one of these motives (L 244). In\ncommenting on moral behavior itself, Wright in effect based ethics on\nhuman nature, because of the importance he accorded to habit in human\nbehavior:\nThe pains of disconcerted or frustrated habits, and the\ninherent pleasure there is in following them, are motives which nature\nhas put into our wills without generally caring to inform us why; and\nshe sometimes decrees, indeed, that her reasons shall not be ours. So\nthat, practically, we find ourselves acting the more reasonably and\nmore for the real ends of nature, in proportion as these are not our\nimmediate motives, but give place to more completely devoted,\nsingle-purposed, and therefore effective powers, or to instincts and\nhabits (L 242).\n\n\nWe see in this passage the separation of immediate causes of action,\nnamely pleasure and pain, from the pattern of action serving nature's\nreal end, namely utility. Wright thought utilitarianism needed, as a\nsupplement, a developed philosophy of habit. In a way similar to his\nexplanation of natural selection, he separated (1) the conditions\nmilitating toward habit, (2) immediate motives for choosing action, and\n(3) the larger principle governing selection of\n action.[12]\n\n\nWright labored in his essays and review articles to make Darwin's\ntheory understandable to the educated American public by countering the\nquestions about what kind of explanation natural selection offered.\nRealizing that utility as a principle provided the logical form for\nDarwin's theory, he insisted that natural selection could not submit to\nrequirements of demonstration. It could not serve as an axiom from\nwhich deduction starts. Indeed, it should be compared to the principle\nof gravitation not as this concept figured in celestial mechanics or\neven in the laboratory but as gravitation is manifest \u201cin the\nconcrete courses of outward nature, in meteorology and physical\ngeology.\u201d Natural selection could be compared to the fundamental\nlaws of political economy, as these laws actually emerge in the fixing\nof value and prices through demand and supply (PD 137). Here\nwe see both the influence of utilitarianism and Wright's belief in the\ninterdependence of different levels of explanatory principles.\n\n\nHis understanding of induction figures also in his defense of\nDarwin. In a review essay of 1870, he commented on the almost universal\nacceptance of Darwin's theory by the scientifically minded and\nattributed its success to \u201cthe skillful combination of inductive\nand deductive proofs with hypothesis.\u201d This combination must\nrely, however, on a preceding simpler induction, he said. The near\nsimultaneous discovery by Wallace and Darwin of the principle behind\nbiological evolution testifies to their ability as naturalists to\nappreciate \u201cthe force of obscure and previously little studied\nfacts\u201d (PD 99). In this context, he also insisted upon\nthe importance to science of investigating principles operating at a\nlevel in nature comparable to the level of political economy. He said\nthat to fail to investigate a principle operating at the level of the\nwhole organism or at the level of populations would go against the\n\u201cAristotelian\u201d tendency of mind of the scientific culture.\nThe scientific mind cannot regard the intricate system of adaptations\nin nature as arbitrary and is not satisfied \u201cso long as any\nexplanation, not tantamount to arbitrariness itself, has any\nprobability in the order of nature\u201d (PD 100).\n\n\nIn responding both to friends and enemies of Darwin's evolution,\nWright sought to keep clear the minimal meaning of natural selection in\nscientific terms. In this way, he did great service to Darwin. Like a\ngood positivist, he was protecting the new theory of evolution from\nannexation into cosmological speculation or alliance with the final\ncausality that was always a part of natural\n theology.[13]\n",
