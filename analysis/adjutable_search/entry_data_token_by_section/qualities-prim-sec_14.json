    "main_text": "Thomas Reid || Are SQs dispositions or causal bases?\n6.2 The capitol parts thesis and the semantics of SQ terms\n\nThis is an issue on which more recent scholars tend to disagree with\nsome earlier ones. The capitol part thesis states that we cannot\nreflect on or distinguish among SQs without conceiving the sensations\nthat signify them. This suggests a close conceptual connection between\nqualities and their proper sensations. Lehrer (1989: 27) maintains it\ncommits Reid to a view on which the meaning of, say, \u201cX\nis red\u201d essentially contains concepts of sensations of red. If\nReid holds that SQs are dispositions manifested by sensations. he is\ncommitted to this semantic claim. But the present question is whether\nor not the capitol part thesis commits him to the semantic claim.\n\nThe thesis about post-perceptual conception of a SQ entails two claims\nthat are directly relevant: that we cannot form the concept of a SQ\nwithout at the same time forming the concept of the sensation it\ncauses and that we cannot have the concept of a SQ unless we have\nexperienced the quality. The need for experience is often taken to\nsupport the view that PQs and SQs differ in respect of how their\nmeanings are specified: in particular, it is said that\n\u201cX is red\u201d means that X manifests\nsensations of red under certain circumstances, whereas the meaning of\n\u201cX is solid\u201d can be specified without reference to\nsensations of solidity. But recent scholars argue that the semantic\nclaim about SQ terms is not entailed by the capitol part remark. They\npoint to reasons for a person\u2019s needing to have the concept of\nthe sensation caused by a quality in order to have the concept of that\nquality\u2014the capitol part thesis\u2014that are independent of\nthe truth or falsity of the semantic claim. Van Cleve points to the\nuse Kripke might make of the perception of SQs to fix the reference of\n\u201cred\u201d in its rigid use, i.e., use as a name for just those\nqualities that cause a certain sort of sensation in the actual world.\nNichols (2006: 6.4) offers a different reason for a similar\nconclusion. But although recent scholars agree about this, they\ndisagree over how Reid intended the capitol part thesis to be\nunderstood.\n\nVan Cleve reports his belief that Reid meant it to entail that SQs are\ndispositions which cannot be conceived unless conceived as manifesting\ncertain sensations. SQs are, then, essentially phenomenal or human\nresponse dependent (Van Cleve 2016: 107\u20139). No argument is\noffered other than the one purporting to show that Reid can be read as\nurging a dispositional theory of SQs (see above). There seems to be no\nconsensus on the interpretative issue.\n",
