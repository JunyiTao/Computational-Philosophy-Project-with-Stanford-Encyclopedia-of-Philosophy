    "main_text": "\n\nSecond-order logic has a subtle role in the philosophy of mathematics.\nIt is stronger than first order logic in that it incorporates\n\u201cfor all properties\u201d into the syntax, while first order\nlogic can only say \u201cfor all elements\u201d. At the same time it\nis arguably weaker than set theory in that its quantifiers range over\none limited domain at a time, while set theory has the universalist\napproach in that its quantifiers range over all possible domains. This\nstronger-than-first-order-logic/weaker-than-set-theory duality is the\nsource of lively debate, not least because set theory is usually\nconstrued as based on first order logic. How can second-order logic be\nat the same time stronger and weaker? To make the situation even more\ncomplex, it was suggested early on that in order that the strength of\nsecond-order logic can be exploited to its full extent and in order\nthat \u201cfor all properties\u201d can be given an exact\ninterpretation, a first order set-theoretical background has to be\nassumed. This seemed to undermine the claimed strength of second-order\nlogic as well as its role as the primary foundation of mathematics. It\nalso seemed to attach second-order logic to aspects of set theory\nwhich second-order logic might have wanted to bypass: the higher\ninfinite, the independence results, and the difficulties in finding\nnew convincing axioms. Setting aside philosophical questions, it is\nundeniable and manifested by a continued stream of interesting\nresults, that second-order logic is part and parcel of a\nlogician\u2019s toolbox.\n",
