Into the 1990s: From Immanent Reversal to Impossible Exchange\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Baudrillard posited an \u201cimmanent\nreversal,\u201d a flip-flop or reversed direction of meaning and\neffects, in which things turn into their opposite. Thus, according to\nBaudrillard, the society of production was passing over to simulation\nand seduction; the panoptic and repressive power theorized by Foucault\nwas turning into a cynical and seductive power of the media and\ninformation society; the liberation championed in the 1960s had become\na form of voluntary servitude; sovereignty had passed from the side of\nthe subject to the object; and revolution and emancipation had turned\ninto their opposites, trapping individuals in an order of simulation\nand virtuality. Baudrillard\u2019s concept of \u201cimmanent\nreversal\u201d thus provides a perverse form of Horkheimer and\nAdorno\u2019s \u201cdialectic of Enlightenment\u201d (1972 [1947]),\nwhere everything becomes its opposite. For Adorno and Horkheimer,\nwithin the transformations of organized and hi-tech capitalism, modes\nof Enlightenment become domination, culture becomes culture industry,\ndemocracy becomes a form of mass manipulation, and science and\ntechnology form a crucial part of an apparatus of social\ndomination.\n\n\nBaudrillard follows this concept of reversal and his paradoxical and\nnihilistic metaphysical vision into the 1990s and 2000s where his\nthought becomes ever more hermetic, fragmentary, and difficult. During\nthe decade, Baudrillard continued playing the role of academic and\nmedia superstar, traveling around the world lecturing and performing in\nintellectual events.\n\n\nRetiring from the University of Nanterre in 1987, Baudrillard\nsubsequently functioned as an independent intellectual, dedicating\nhimself to caustic reflections on our contemporary moment and\nphilosophical ruminations that cultivate his distinct and always\nevolving theory. From June 1987 through May 1997, he published\nreflections on events and phenomena of the day in the Paris newspaper\nLiberation, a series of writings collected in Screened\nOut (2002 [2000]) and providing access to a laboratory for ideas\nlater elaborated in his books.\n\n\nDuring the 1990s and until his death, Baudrillard continued to write\nshort journal entries and by 2007 had published five volumes of his\nCool Memories. These texts combine reflections on his travels\nand experiences with development of his (often recycled) ideas and\nperceptions. Baudrillard\u2019s fragmentary diaries often provide\nrevealing insights into his personal life and psychology, as well as\ncapturing experiences and scenes that generate or embody some of his\nideas. While often repetitive, his \u201ccool memory\u201d booklets\nprovide direct access to the man and his ideas, as well as validating\nhim as a global intellectual superstar who travels around the earth and\nwhose every diary notation is worthy of publication and attention.\n\n\nBaudrillard also produced reflections on contemporary issues like\nthe Gulf War, the September 11 terror attacks, that he saw as the only\nreal \u201cevent\u201d of the past decades, globalization, the US\ninvasion of Iraq, and other occurrences of the\n day.[8]\nBaudrillard also continued his metaphysical\nspeculations in works such as The Transparency of Evil (1993\n[1990]), The Illusion of the End (1994b [1992]), The\nPerfect Crime (1996b [1995]), Impossible Exchange (2001\n[1999]), The Intelligence of Evil or the Lucicity Pact (2005),\nand The Conspiracy of Art (2005). These texts continue his\nexcursions into the metaphysics of the object and defeat of the subject\nand ironical engagement with contemporary history and politics.\nBringing together reflections that develop his ideas and/or comment on\ncontemporary events, these texts continue to postulate a break within\nhistory in the space of a postmodern coupure, though\nBaudrillard himself usually distances himself from other versions of\npostmodern\n theory.[9]\n\n\nBaudrillard\u2019s retirement from a sociology faculty seemed to have\nliberated his philosophical impulses and in addition to his diary\ncollections and occasional forays into engagement of issues of the\nday, Baudrillard turned out a series of increasingly philosophical and\ndensely theoretical texts.  The post-1990 texts continue the\nfragmentary style and use of short essays, aphorisms, stories, and\naper\u00e7us that Baudrillard began deploying in the 1980s and often\nrepeat some of the same ideas and stories. While the books develop the\nquasi-metaphysical perspectives of the 1980s, they also generate some\nnew ideas and positions. They are often entertaining, although they\ncan also be outrageous and scandalous. These writings can be read as a\ncombination of cultivation of original theoretical perspectives along\nwith continual commentary on current social conditions, accompanied by\na running dialogue with Marxism, poststructuralist theory, and other\nforms of contemporary thought. Yet after his fierce and focused\npolemics of the 1970s against competing models of thought,\nBaudrillard\u2019s later dialogues with theory consist mostly of\noccasional asides and recycling of previous ideas, a retro-theory that\nperhaps ironically illustrates his theses about the decline of theory\nand politics in the contemporary moment.\n\n\nIn The Transparency of Evil (1993), Baudrillard described a\nsituation in which previously separate domains of the economy, art,\npolitics, and sexuality, collapsed into each other. He claims that art,\nfor instance, has penetrated all spheres of existence, whereby the\ndreams of the artistic avant-garde for art to inform life has been\nrealized. Yet, in Baudrillard\u2019s vision, with the realization of\nart in everyday life, art itself as a separate and transcendent\nphenomenon has disappeared.\n\n\nBaudrillard calls this situation \u201ctransaesthetics\u201d which\nhe relates to similar phenomena of \u201ctranspolitics,\u201d\n\u201ctranssexuality,\u201d and \u201ctranseconomics,\u201d in\nwhich everything becomes political, sexual, and economic, so that these\ndomains, like art, lose their specificity, their boundaries, and their\ndistinctness. The result is a confused condition where there are no\nmore criteria of value, of judgement, or of taste, and the function of\nthe normative thus collapses in a morass of indifference and inertia.\nAnd so, although Baudrillard sees art proliferating everywhere, and\nwrites in The Transparency of Evil that \u201ctalk about Art\nis increasing even more rapidly\u201d (p. 14), the power of art\n\u2014 of art as adventure, art as negation of reality, art as\nredeeming illusion, art as another dimension and so on \u2014 has\ndisappeared. Art is everywhere but there \u201care no more fundamental\nrules\u201d to differentiate art from other objects and \u201cno more\ncriteria of judgement or of pleasure\u201d (p. 14). For Baudrillard,\ncontemporary individuals are indifferent toward taste and manifest only\ndistaste: \u201ctastes are determinate no longer\u201d (p. 72).\n\n\nAnd yet as a proliferation of images, of form, of line, of color, of\ndesign, art is more fundamental then ever to the contemporary social\norder: \u201cour society has given rise to a general aestheticization:\nall forms of culture \u2014 not excluding anti-cultural ones \u2014\nare promoted and all models of representation and anti-representation\nare taken on board\u201d (p. 16). Thus Baudrillard concludes that:\n\u201cIt is often said that the West\u2019s great undertaking is the\ncommercialization of the whole world, the hitching of the fate of\neverything to the fate of the commodity. That great undertaking will\nturn out rather to have been the aestheticization of the whole world\n\u2014 its cosmopolitan spectacularization, its transformation into\nimages, its semiological organization\u201d (p. 16).\n\n\nIn the postmodern media and consumer society, everything becomes an\nimage, a sign, a spectacle, a transaesthetic object \u2014 just as\neverything also becomes trans-economic, trans-political, and\ntrans-sexual. This \u201cmaterialization of aesthetics\u201d\nis accompanied by a desperate attempt to simulate art, to replicate and\nmix previous artistic forms and styles, and to produce ever more images\nand artistic objects. But this \u201cdizzying eclecticism\u201d of\nforms and pleasures produces a situation in which art is no longer art\nin classical or modernist senses but is merely image, artifact, object,\nsimulation, or commodity (Baudrillard is aware of increasingly\nexorbitant prices for art works, but takes this as evidence that art\nhas become something else in the orbital hyperspace of value, an\necstasy of skyrocketing values in \u201ca kind of space opera\u201d\n[p. 19]).\n\n\nExamples of the paradoxical and ironic style of Baudrillard\u2019s\nphilosophical musings abound in The Perfect Crime (1996b).\nBaudrillard claims that the negation of a transcendent reality in the\ncurrent media and technological society is a \u201cperfect\ncrime\u201d that involves the \u201cdestruction of the real.\u201d\nIn a world of appearance, image, and illusion, Baudrillard suggests,\nreality disappears although its traces continue to nourish an illusion\nof the real. Driven toward virtualization in a high-tech society, all\nthe imperfections of human life and the world are eliminated in virtual\nreality, but this is the elimination of reality itself, the Perfect\nCrime. This \u201cpost-critical\u201d and \u201ccatastrophic\u201d\nstate of affairs render our previous conceptual world irrelevant,\nBaudrillard suggests, urging criticism to turn ironic and transform the\ndemise of the real into an art form.\n\n\nBaudrillard has entered a world of thought far from academic\nphilosophy, one that puts in question traditional modes of thought and\ndiscourse. His search for new philosophical perspectives has won him a\nloyal global audience, but also criticism for his excessive irony, word\nplay, and intellectual games. Yet his work stands as a provocation to\ntraditional and contemporary philosophy that challenges thinkers to\naddress old philosophical problems such as truth and reality in new\nways in the contemporary world.\n\n\nBaudrillard continues this line of thought in his 1999 text\nImpossible Exchange (2001). In three parts containing a series\nof short essays, he first develops his concept of an \u201cimpossible\nexchange\u201d between concepts and the world, theory and reality, and\nsubject and object. He attacks philosophical attempts to capture\nreality, arguing for an incommensurability between concepts and their\nobjects, systems of thought and the world. For Baudrillard, the latter\nalways elude capture by the former, thus philosophy is an\n\u201cimpossible exchange\u201d in which it is impossible to grasp\nthe truth of the world, to attain certainty, to establish a foundation\nfor philosophy, and/or produce a defensible philosophical system.\n\n\nIn retrospect, Baudrillard\u2019s philosophical play with the\nsubject/object distinction, his abandonment of the subject, and going\nover to the side of the object is a key aspect of his thought. He\nidentifies this dichotomy with the duality of good and evil in which\nthe cultivation of the subject and its domination of the object is\ntaken as the good within Western thought, while the sovereignty and\nside of the object is interwoven with the principle of evil.\nBaudrillard\u2019s thought is radically dualistic and he takes the\nside of the pole within a series of dichotomies of Western thought that\nhas generally been derided as inferior, such as siding with appearance\nagainst reality, illusion over truth, evil over good, and woman over\nman. In The Perfect Crime (1996b), Baudrillard has declared\nthat reality has been destroyed and henceforth that people live in a\nworld of mere appearance. In this universe, certainty and truth are\nimpossible and Baudrillard takes the side of illusion, arguing in\nImpossible Exchange (2001) that: \u201cIllusion is the\nfundamental rule\u201d (p. 6).\n\n\nBaudrillard also argues that the world is without meaning and that\naffirming meaninglessness is liberating: \u201cIf we could accept this\nmeaninglessness of the world, then we could play with forms,\nappearances and our impulses, without worrying about their ultimate\ndestination\u2026 As Cioran says, we are not failures until we\nbelieve life has a meaning \u2013 and from that point on we are\nfailures, because it hasn\u2019t\u201d (2001: 128). Most\ncontroversially, Baudrillard also identifies with the principle of evil\ndefined as that which is opposed to and against the good. There is an\nadmittedly Manichean and Gnostic dimension to his thought, mixed with\nskepticism, cynicism and\n nihilism.[10]\nDeconstruction, however, takes apart the\nsubject/object dichotomy indicating the impossibly of taking the side\nof subject or object, or of good and evil as both are interconnected\nwith each other and there can be no pure object without subject and\nvice versa, an argument Adorno has\n made.[11]\nBaudrillard\u2019s thought is intrinsically\ndualistic and not dialectical. His thought is self-avowedly agonistic\nwith the duel presented in tandem with his dualism, taking on and\nattacking rival theories and positions. Contradictions do not bother\nBaudrillard, for indeed he affirms them. It is thus tricky to argue\nwith Baudrillard on strictly philosophical grounds and one needs to\ngrasp his mode of writing, his notion of theory fictions (see\n Section 5),\nand to engage their saliency and effects.\n",
