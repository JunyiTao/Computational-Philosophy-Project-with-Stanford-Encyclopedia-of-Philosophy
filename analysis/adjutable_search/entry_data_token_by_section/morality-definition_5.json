    "main_text": "Variations || Morality as linked to norms for responses to behavior\n5.1 Morality as linked to norms for responses to behavior\n\nExpressivists about morality do not take there to be any objective\ncontent to morality that could underwrite what we above called\n\u201cthe substantive definition\u201d. Rather, they explicitly\nrecognize the existence of significant variation in what rules and\nideals different people put forward as morality in the normative\nsense. And they doubt that this variation is compatible with moral\nrealism. Consequently, they need to offer some unifying features of\nthese different sets of rules and ideals, despite variation in their\ncontent. As a result of this pressure, some expressivists end up\noffering explicit accounts of a distinctively moral attitude\none might hold towards an act token or type. These accounts can of\ncourse be taken to underwrite various forms of morality in the\ndescriptive sense. But they can also be taken to provide the basis of\none form of moral realism.\n\nTo see how an expressivist view can be co-opted by a moral realist of\na certain sort, consider Allan Gibbard\u2019s (1990) moral\nexpressivism. Gibbard holds that moral judgments are expressions of\nthe acceptance of norms for feeling the emotions of guilt and anger.\nOne can accept Gibbard\u2019s view of what it is to endorse a moral\nclaim without accepting the view that, in conflicts, all disagreements\nare faultless. That is, even a moral realist can use Gibbard\u2019s\nview of the nature of moral judgment, and extract from it a definition\nof morality. Used by such a theorist, Gibbard\u2019s view entails\nthat morality, in the normative sense, is the code that is picked out\nby the correct set of norms for feeling guilt and anger: that\nis, the norms a rational person would endorse. This is\nequivalent to accepting the plausible general schema for a definition\nof \u201cmorality\u201d given above, and understanding endorsement\nin a special sense. To endorse a code in the relevant way, on this\ndefinition, is to think that violations of its norms make guilt and\nanger appropriate.\n\nClosely related to Gibbard\u2019s account is one according to which\nthe norms of relevance are not norms for the emotions, but are norms\nfor other reactions to behavior. For example, a person\u2019s\nmorality might be the set of rules and ideals they regard as picked\nout by appropriate norms for praise and blame, and other social\nsanctions (Sprigge 1964: 317). In fact, reference to praise and blame\nmay be more adequate than reference to guilt and anger, since the\nlatter seem only to pick out moral prohibitions, and not to make room\nfor the idea that morality also recommends or encourages certain\nbehaviors even if it does not require them. For example, it is\nplausible that there is such a thing as supererogatory action, and\nthat the specification of what counts as supererogatory is part of\nmorality\u2014whether in the descriptive or normative sense. But it\ndoes not seem likely that we can account for this part of morality by\nappeal to norms for guilt and anger, and it is not at all clear that\nthere are emotions that are as closely linked to supererogation as\nguilt and anger are to moral transgression. On the other hand, it\nseems plausible that norms for praising action might help to pick out\nwhat counts as supererogatory.\n\nAnother version of the present strategy would replace talk of praise\nand blame with talk of reward and punishment. This view would take\nmorality to be a system that explained what kinds of actions are\nappropriately rewarded and\u2014more centrally\u2014punished. This\nsort of view, which remains closely related to Gibbard\u2019s\nsuggestion, can also be regarded as fitting the general schema given\nabove. On this view, the notion of endorsing a code is unpacked in\nterms of the acceptance of norms for reward and punishment. Skorupski\n(1993), following Mill (1861), advocates a definition of morality\nalong these lines, though he then understands punishment primarily in\nterms of blame, and understands blame as very closely linked to\nemotion\u2014indeed, merely having the emotion can count as\nblaming\u2014so that the resulting view is similar to Gibbard\u2019s\nin one important way, at least when one focuses on moral\nwrongness.\n\nIt is certainly plausible that it is appropriate to feel guilt when\none acts immorally, and to feel anger at those who act immorally\ntowards those one cares about. It is even plausible that it is\nonly appropriate, in some particular sense of\n\u201cappropriate\u201d, to feel guilt and anger in connection with\nmoral transgressions. So norms for guilt and anger may well uniquely\npick out certain moral norms. And similar claims might be made about\nnorms for praise and blame. However, it is not equally clear that\nmorality is properly defined in terms of emotions or other\nreactions to behavior. For it may be, as Skorupski emphasizes, that we\nneed to understand guilt and anger, and praise and blame, in terms of\nmoral concepts. This worry about direction of explanation seems less\npressing for the notions of reward and punishment. These responses to\nbehavior, at least in themselves, might simply be understood\nin terms of the meting out of benefits and harms. Of course they will\nonly count as reward and punishment when they are linked to\nsomeone\u2019s having followed or violated a rule that all rational\npeople would want to see enforced by such responses.\n",
