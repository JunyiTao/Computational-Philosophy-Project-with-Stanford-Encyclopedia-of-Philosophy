However, the actualism/possibilism debate\ncuts across debates about the relevant sense(s) of \u201ccan\u201d.\nActualists and possibilists may agree with one another about which\nact-sets agents can perform in any given case. At bottom, their\ndisagreement concerns which acts, from among the acts the agent can\nperform, are normatively relevant options for the agent. Less\nabstractly, actualists and possibilists may agree that Procrastinate\ncan \\(\\langle X\\rangle\\), \\(\\langle Y\\rangle\\), or \\(\\langle\nZ\\rangle\\). After all, by stipulation, she can \\(\\langle a\\rangle\\)\nand if she \\(\\langle a\\textrm{-s}\\rangle\\), then by stipulation she\ncan \\(\\langle b\\rangle\\) and if she does that, then she will have\nperformed \\(\\langle X\\rangle \\). Procrastinate can \\(\\langle\nX\\rangle\\), though one may still wonder whether she has the relevant\nkind of ability to \\(\\langle X\\rangle \\). That is, one may\nwonder whether \\(\\langle X\\textrm{-ing}\\rangle\\) is a relevant\noption for the agent. It is this question that divides\nactualists and possibilists. Goldman (1976: 453 and 1978: 153)\ninitially suggested that \\(\\langle X\\textrm{-ing}\\rangle\\) is a\nrelevant option for the agent, appealing to the following\naccount of ability.\n\n Ability 1: An agent has the ability at\n\\(t_1\\) to perform an act A at \\(t_1 +N\\) just in case there is\na sequence of acts such that the agent has the ability at \\(t_1\\) to\nperform the first of these acts at \\(t_1\\), and if he performs the\nfirst act, then at a later time he will have the ability to perform\nthe second act at that time, and if he performs the first two acts at\ntheir respective times, then at a still later time he will have the\nability to perform the third act at that time, and so forth, until\nfinally if he performs all the acts in the sequence at their\nrespective times, then at \\(t_1 +N\\) he will have the ability to\nperform act A at \\(t_1 +N\\). \n\n\n\nInterestingly, Goldman (1978) later rejects this account of ability\nafter considering cases where, at \\(t_1\\), the agent can \\(\\langle\na\\rangle\\), but would not \\(\\langle b\\rangle\\) and thus would not\n\\(\\langle X\\rangle \\), regardless of her intentions at \\(t_1\\). Such\ncases are ones where it\u2019s possible for the agent to \\(\\langle\nX\\rangle\\), but Goldman argues that it would be \u201cpointless to\nuse this account of ability when assessing the range of activities\nwhich a moral principle should assess\u201d. This is because agents\n\u201ccould not make practical use of\u201d prescriptions to perform\nsuch alternatives. These types of cases will be discussed in more\ndetail the next section. For now, the important takeaway is that while\nan agent can perform such conjunctive act-sets in the sense\npicked out by Ability 1, there may be times before the agent\nacts during which she cannot ensure that she will perform these\nact-sets. So, while it\u2019s possible for Procrastinate to \\(\\langle\nX\\rangle\\) by intending to \\(\\langle a\\rangle\\) at \\(t_1\\) and then\nintending to \\(\\langle b\\rangle\\) at \\(t_2\\), it may also be true\nthat, at \\(t_1\\), Procrastinate would not \\(\\langle b\\rangle\\) at\n\\(t_2\\) no matter what she intends to do at \\(t_1\\). In light of such\ncases, Goldman proposes the following account of ability. \n\n Ability 2: An agent has the ability at\n\\(t_1\\) to perform an act A at a later time \\(t_n\\) if and only\nif it is true that if the agent wanted at \\(t_1\\) to perform A\nat \\(t_n\\), he would do so (Goldman 1978: 195).\n\n\nSo, for any given act-set, actualists and possibilists will agree\nabout whether an agent has Ability 1, Ability 2, or\nboth to perform that act-set and thus will agree about each sense in\nwhich agents can perform these act-sets. Yet, they will disagree about\nwhich sense of ability picks out the morally relevant set of options\nfor an agent. Possibilists (e.g., Feldman 1986; Zimmerman 1996),\nhybridists (Timmerman & Cohen 2016), and some actualists (e.g.,\nJackson & Pargetter 1986; Jackson 2014) take Ability 1 to\nbe a morally relevant sense of ability. Most actualists and all\nsecuritists (e.g., Portmore 2011, 2018) will take Ability 2,\nor something close to it, to be the morally relevant sense of\nability.\n",
