    "main_text": "Psycho-physical Monism and Anti-nominalism\n8. Psycho-physical Monism and Anti-nominalism\n\n\nPeirce held that science suggests that the universe has evolved from a\ncondition of maximum freedom and spontaneity into its present\ncondition, in which it has taken on a number of habits, sometimes more\nentrenched habits and sometimes less entrenched ones. With pure\nfreedom and spontaneity Peirce tended to associate mind, and with\nfirmly entrenched habits he tended to associate matter (or, more\ngenerally, the physical). Matter he tended to regard as\n\u201ccongealed\u201d or \u201ceffete\u201d mind (1891; CP, 6.25;\nEP, 1.293). Thus he tended to see the universe as the\nend-product-so-far of a process in which mind has acquired habits and\nhas \u201ccongealed\u201d (this is the very word Peirce used) into\nmatter.\n\n\nThis notion of all things as being evolved psycho-physical unities of\nsome sort places Peirce well within the sphere of what might be called\n\u201cthe grand old-fashioned metaphysicians,\u201d along with such\nthinkers as Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Spinoza, Leibniz, Hegel,\nSchopenhauer, Whitehead, et al. Some contemporary\nphilosophers might be inclined to reject Peirce out of hand upon\ndiscovering this fact. Others might find his notion of psycho-physical\nunities not so very offputting or indeed even attractive. What is\ncrucial is that Peirce argued that mind pervades all of nature in\nvarying degrees: it is not found merely in the most advanced animal\nspecies.\n\n\nThis pan-psychistic view, combined with his synechism, meant for Peirce\nthat mind is extended in some sort of continuum throughout the\nuniverse. Peirce tended to think of ideas as existing in mind in\nsomewhat the same way as physical forms exist in physically extended\nthings. He even spoke of ideas as \u201cspreading\u201d out through the same\ncontinuum in which mind is extended. This set of conceptions is part\nof what Peirce regarded as (his own version of) Scotistic realism,\nwhich he sharply contrasted with nominalism. He tended to blame what\nhe regarded as the errors of much of the philosophy of his\ncontemporaries as owing to its nominalistic disregard for the\nobjective existence of form.\n",
