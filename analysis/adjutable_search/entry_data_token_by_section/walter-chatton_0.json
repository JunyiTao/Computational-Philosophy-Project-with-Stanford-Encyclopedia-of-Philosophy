    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nChatton\u2019s life and career can be divided into four\n stages.[1]\n\nChildhood, ordination, and philosophical training (birth to\n1315). Walter Chatton was born between 1285 and 1290 in the\nsmall village of Chatton, just west of Durham, in the far north of\nmodern England. He entered the Franciscan Order before the age of 14,\nand was ordained a subdeacon on 20 May, 1307. He very likely received\nhis early education and philosophical training in the north as\nwell.\n\nEarly bachelor of theology studies (1315 to 1321).\nDuring this period Chatton finished his early education and was sent\nsouth to Oxford to study theology. There he came in contact with\nWilliam of Ockham who was lecturing at Oxford at this same time,\nalthough at a slightly more advanced career stage. Chatton began to\noppose Ockham very early and very vocally, and this opposition was to\nlast the entire duration of his Oxford career (i.e., into the early\n1330s).\n\nAdvanced bachelor studies and regency (1321 to 1332).\nWe have the least amount of hard biographical data for this period,\nalthough it is clearly the most interesting and intense intellectual\nperiod of his life. Textual evidence allows us to argue with varying\ndegrees of certainty that four of his five extant works \u2013\nReportatio, Lectura (which includes the separately\nedited Collatio et Prologus), Quodlibet, De\npaupertate evangelica, and Sermo de visione beatifica\n\u2013 were written during this\n period.[2]\n We have long possessed reasonable dates (although they are wide, in\none case) for the first two of these works: he probably delivered his\nReportatio lectures during the academic biennium\n1321\u201323, and his Lectura must have been written between\n1324 and\n 1330.[3]\n The first three works listed above are of primary philosophical\nimportance in his corpus. During this period Chatton delivered an\nimportant set of lectures in which Ockham\u2019s thought is\nstrenuously criticized (probably in London), completed his training at\nOxford, and attained the final academic rank marking that achievement,\nregent master, in academic year\n 1329\u20131330.[4]\n\nLater career in Avignon, and death (1332 to 1343/4).\nChatton is known to have been in Avignon on 17 January, 1333. He was\nsummoned there in order to participate in hearings against Thomas\nWaleys, and eventually he served as an advisor to Pope Benedict XII.\nHis career took an excellent upward turn in 1343 when he was appointed\nbishop of the Welsh See of Asaph, but this good fortune reversed\nitself when it turned out the position was not really vacant. That\nwinter, earthly good fortune gave up on Chatton completely, and he\ndied in Avignon, late in 1343 or perhaps early\n 1344.[5]\n",
