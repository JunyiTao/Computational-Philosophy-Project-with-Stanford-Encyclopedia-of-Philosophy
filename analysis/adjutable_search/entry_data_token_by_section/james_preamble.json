    "main_text": "\n\nWilliam James was an original thinker in and between the disciplines\nof physiology, psychology and philosophy. His twelve-hundred page\nmasterwork, The Principles of Psychology (1890), is a rich\nblend of physiology, psychology, philosophy, and personal reflection\nthat has given us such ideas as \u201cthe stream of thought\u201d\nand the baby\u2019s impression of the world \u201cas one great\nblooming, buzzing confusion\u201d (PP 462). It contains seeds of\npragmatism and phenomenology, and influenced generations of thinkers\nin Europe and America, including Edmund Husserl, Bertrand Russell,\nJohn Dewey, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. James studied at Harvard\u2019s\nLawrence Scientific School and the School of Medicine, but his\nwritings were from the outset as much philosophical as scientific.\n\u201cSome Remarks on Spencer\u2019s Notion of Mind as\nCorrespondence\u201d (1878) and \u201cThe Sentiment of\nRationality\u201d (1879, 1882) presage his future pragmatism and\npluralism, and contain the first statements of his view that\nphilosophical theories are reflections of a philosopher\u2019s\ntemperament.\n\nJames hints at his religious concerns in his earliest essays and in\nThe Principles, but they become more explicit in The Will\nto Believe and Other Essays in Popular Philosophy (1897),\nHuman Immortality: Two Supposed Objections to the Doctrine\n(1898), The Varieties of Religious Experience (1902) and\nA Pluralistic Universe (1909). James oscillated between\nthinking that a \u201cstudy in human nature\u201d such as\nVarieties could contribute to a \u201cScience of\nReligion\u201d and the belief that religious experience involves an\naltogether supernatural domain, somehow inaccessible to science but\naccessible to the individual human subject. \n\nJames made some of his most important philosophical contributions in\nthe last decade of his life. In a burst of writing in 1904\u20135\n(collected in  Essays in Radical Empiricism (1912)) he set\nout the metaphysical view most commonly known as \u201cneutral\nmonism,\u201d according to which there is one fundamental\n\u201cstuff\u201d that is neither material nor mental.  In\n\u201cA Pluralistic Universe\u201d he defends the mystical and\nanti-pragmatic view that concepts distort rather than reveal reality,\nand in his influential Pragmatism (1907), he presents\nsystematically a set of views about truth, knowledge, reality,\nreligion, and philosophy that permeate his writings from the late\n1870s onwards.\n",
