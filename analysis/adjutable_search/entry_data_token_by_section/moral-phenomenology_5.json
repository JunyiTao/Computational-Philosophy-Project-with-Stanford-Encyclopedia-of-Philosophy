    "main_text": "Moral Phenomenology and Metaethics || Moral emotion\n2.2 Moral emotion\n\nSome Phenomenologists approach the analysis of feelings and emotions\nthrough the theory of value (axiology) [e.g., Edmund Husserl\n(1908\u20139/1911/1914, 1920/1924, 1916\u201335), Nicolai Hartmann\n(1926), Alexius Meinong (1917), Adolf Reinach (1912/1913), Max Scheler\n(1913/1916), Edith Stein (1917), and Dietrich von Hildebrand (1916,\n1922, 1953)]. (For additional information, see the entries on\n Edmund Husserl,\n phenomenology,\n the phenomenology of the Munich and G\u00f6ttingen Circles,\n Nicolai Hartmann,\n Alexius Meinong,\n Adolf Reinach,\n Max Scheler,\n and\n Edith Stein.)\n For these Phenomenologists moral perception and moral emotion merge\nin experiencing value properties in general and moral properties in\nparticular. They agree that only beings capable of feelings or\nemotions can grasp values and the significance attaching to them.\nHarman\u2019s cat example illustrates this. It is clear that we see\nthe cat and someone performing actions that seriously injure the\nhelpless animal. This is an ordinary perception of the features and\nactions of worldly beings. We also \u201csee\u201d the wrongness of\nthese actions in the disgust or horror that we feel. This is what\naxiological Phenomenologists mean when they claim that the value is\n\u201cperceived\u201d by an intentional feeling or an emotion.\n\nThese Phenomenologists also agree that intentional feelings or\nemotions grasp value-objects independent of those feelings, in the\nsense that neither a thing\u2019s being valuable nor the truth or\nfalsity of value attributions is reducible to or solely dependent upon\nthe intentional feeling. There are important differences, however, in\nhow Phenomenologists understand the relation between the\n\u201cmere\u201d perceiving of material things and experiencing the\nvalue property and how they understand the independence of the\nvalue-object. These differences are tied to different understandings\nof the German term\n wertnehmen,[14]\n which parallels wahrnehmen, to perceive. Focusing on the\naspect of \u201ctaking\u201d\u2014nehmen\u2014common to\nperceiving and valuing emphasizes their relation. A taking is a\nsingle, unified experience having two distinguishable aspects, a\ntaking as true and a taking as valuable. The truth-taking and the\nvalue-taking occur together even as they remain distinguishable.\nAlthough their focus is on value in general, these Phenomenologists\nagree that the emotions have moral relevance and that our choices are\nin some manner rooted in the emotional disclosure of the value of both\nthe ends at which the agent aims and the actions conducive to those\nends. By extension, therefore, and despite differing accounts of the\nexperience of value, they also view themselves as moral realists (see\nthe entry on\n moral realism).\n\nOn one view\u2014a \u201cweak\u201d or response-dependent value\nrealism\u2014to perceive a value (wertnehmen) is for an\nintentional feeling or\n emotion[15]\n to grasp an entity (e.g., a thing, state of affairs, action, event,\nperson, institution) as valued\u2014or, as in the case of\nHarman\u2019s cat example, disvalued. Someone\u2019s horror upon\nseeing the boys burning the cat takes the burning of the cat by the\nboys as dastardly. The (dis)value of the boys\u2019 action is\ngrounded in the particular, non-axiological features involved (the\nboys\u2019 pouring gasoline on the cat and igniting the gasoline),\nwhich, relative to the experiential history, interests, concerns, and\ncommitments (including moral) of the subject, are taken to be\n(dis)valuable. Just as the perception of a thing S takes\nS as p (the cat as having gasoline poured\non it and ignited by the group of boys), the feeling-apprehension or\nemotional apprehension takes Sp as v (the\ncat\u2019s being burned by the boys as horrible). The non-axiological\nproperty p psychologically motivates the experience of the\nemotion with its correlative value property, and p also\nepistemically (and, contra V\u00e4yrynen 2018,\nnon-inferentially) justifies the value-attribution. And just as the\nperceptual taking of S as p (the cat as\nhaving gasoline poured on it and ignited by the group of boys)\nincludes the naive belief in the existence of Sp (has realist\npurport), the feeling or emotional apprehension of Sp as v\n(the cat\u2019s having been burned by the boys as horrible) includes\nthe naive belief in the existence of Sp along with its\nvalue-attribute v. Feelings and emotions, in other words, are\na kind of axiological perception revelatory of value-properties.\n\nThe notion of taking something as valuable, on this view, entails that\na value is in the first instance just the object experienced as\nvaluable rather than the value-property alone or an abstract\nvalue-object of some kind. Finally, since these takings are\npre-predicative, the term \u201cvalue-perception\u201d or\n\u201cvalue-taking\u201d (Wertnehmung) further entails that\nfeelings and emotions as evaluative experiences need not involve\npropositional content (although they can and, perhaps more often than\nnot, do). In other words, a belief or judgment (even a value judgment)\ncan provide the underlying basis for an (additional) experience of\nvalue, in which case the feeling-apprehension or emotion takes\n[that S is p] as\n v.[16]\n For more detailed discussion of this view, see Drummond 1995, 2013,\n2017; Husserl 1908\u20139/1911/1914; Loidolt 2010, 2011, 2018; Melle\n1991, 1992, 1997, 2007; Peucker 2011; Rinofner-Kreidl 2013; and\nVendrell Ferran 2008, 2013. For analyses along these lines of\nparticular moral emotions, see Drummond 2018a, 2020b; Hein\u00e4maa\n2014, 2018; M. Kelly 2016a, 2016b, 2016c; Ozar 2009, 2010, 2018;\nRinofner-Kreidl 2014a, 2014b, 2018; and Vendrell Ferran 2018a.\n\nA second view\u2014a \u201cstrong\u201d or response-independent\nvalue realism\u2014holds that intentional feelings directly apprehend\na priori values ontologically and epistemologically prior to\nexperiencing any particular object as a bearer of value (Scheler\n1913/1916; Hartmann 1926; Mulligan 2010; Steinbock 2014, von\nHildebrand 1916). On this view, intentional feelings and emotions\nseparate. Intentional feelings apprehend the a priori value\nitself; they provide access to the domain of values and to their\nhierarchy, which\u2014to use Scheler\u2019s example (1913/1916\n[1973: 86\u2013100])\u2014ascends from sensory values (the agreeable\nand the disagreeable) to vital values (e.g., the noble and the\nvulgar), spiritual values (e.g., the beautiful and the ugly, the true\nand the false), and, at the apex, the holy and the unholy. Values and\nthis hierarchy \u201cflash before us\u201d (Scheler 1913/1916 [1973:\n68]) in loving and hating (the two basic feelings) and in preferring\nand placing behind or after. Emotions, by contrast, do not reveal\nvalue in the way intentional feelings do. They are the subject\u2019s\nresponses to the felt value. Von Hildebrand makes the point\nclearly:\n\n\nI see a child mistreated on the street and a terrible outrage rises\nwithin me. I am outraged by the vulgarity and brutality of this\nbehavior. The outrage is clearly [\u2026] a response to these\nqualities with which I am already familiar (emphasis added).\n(von Hildebrand 1916 [1973: 137])\n\n\nThe feeling-apprehension of the a priori (dis)value underlies\nthe grasp of an object as a good (or bad). The felt value is the\ngood-making characteristic of the object valued as good or the\nbad-making characteristic of the object valued as bad. Contra\nthe \u201cweak\u201d view, however, the value itself does not depend\non the features of the object that is the bearer of the value. While\nvalued objects (goods), considered as objects of desire, are\nempirical, variable, and subjective, the values themselves are not;\nthey are a priori, immutable, and objective ideals. The\nperceptual experience of the bearer is only contingently related\nto\u2014that is, is the occasion for\u2014the feeling-apprehension\nof the value. Aspects of this view are analyzed and developed in\nBarber 1993; Bartky 1997; Blosser 1987, 1995, 2005, 2012; Davis 2009,\n2012; Frings 1996, 1997; E. Kelly 1977, 2011; Schneck 1987; Spader\n2002; Steinbock 2007, 2013, 2014, 2016; and Vendrell Ferran 2018b.\n\nThe difference between the two views of moral emotion can be\ncharacterized as follows: On the first view, being outraged at the\nmistreatment of the child just is to see the treatment of the child\nwith its non-axiological features as vulgar and brutal. On the second\nview, seeing the mistreatment of the child and feeling the disvalues\n\u201cvulgar\u201d and \u201cbrutal\u201d, I respond with outrage\ndirected at the child\u2019s mistreatment.\n\nFinally, in the analytic tradition, one also finds views featuring\naffect (Johnston 2001), moral emotion (D\u00f6ring 2003), desires\n(Oddie 2005), and experiences of pain (Bain 2013) as modes of\nexperiential access to moral properties, and so in this respect such\nviews are allied with the Phenomenological work just surveyed.\n",
