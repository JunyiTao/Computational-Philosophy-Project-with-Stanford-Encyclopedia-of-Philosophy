    "main_text": "Libertarian Paternalism || Manipulation\n4.5 Manipulation\n\nSince nudges are defined to exclude coercion, and they usually are not\ncases of outright deception (as opposed to a lack of transparency) the\nconcept that is often used to criticize nudges is that of\nmanipulation. The charge of manipulation is raised often against the\nacts of others even when, like nudging, they are benevolently\nmotivated. We think of manipulation, like other forms of paternalism\nas failing to respect us as rational and capable choosers. After all,\nif we were capable choosers why not just present us with the reasons\nwhich favor our acting in particular way?\n\n\nNudging uses the clever tricks of modern psychology and economics to\nmanipulate people. We don\u2019t like manipulation when it\u2019s\ndone to sell us things; we shouldn\u2019t like manipulation when our\ngovernments do it to us. (Wilkinson, see Other Internet Resources)\n\n\n\nThe problem is that manipulation seems a very amorphous and\nill-understood concept. There is widespread disagreement about what\nkinds of influence are manipulative and the conditions under which\nthey are wrong.\n\nThere seems to be only general agreement on the idea that in some way\nor other manipulation interferes, or perverts, or takes advantage of\nfactors that people would not want to influence, the decision making\nof agents. Whether manipulation must be intentional, whether it must\nbe hidden, whether the motive of the manipulator matters, whether\nthere has to be a gap between the way in which the influence causes\nbehavior and the reasons which justify it , whether there has to be a\nmanipulator if one is manipulated, all are contested in the literature\n(see papers in Coons and Weber 2013).\n\nEven if there were a consensus on the widely shared view that\ninterpersonal manipulation is unjustified only when there is a bypass or subversion\nof the rational capacities of the person being influenced there will\nbe much disagreement about what \u201cbypass\u201d and\n\u201csubverts\u201d come to. Does making use of framing effects in\nconveying information \u201cbypass\u201d or \u201csubvert\u201d\nrational capacities? Is harnessing a non-rational propensity of a\nperson bypassing or subverting rational capacities?\n\nPerhaps people perceive a process as manipulative only if they already\ndisapprove of it for other reasons. A recent series of experiments\ndiscovered that people\u2019s views of whether a given nudge was\nmanipulative varied with whether the nudge was in the direction of\ntheir political convictions or not (Fox and Tannenbaum 2015).\n\nIn almost every case, respondents on the left of the political\nspectrum supported nudges when they were illustrated with a liberal\nagenda but opposed them when they were illustrated with a conservative\none; meanwhile, respondents on the political right exhibited the\nopposite pattern.\n\nGiven the very different conceptions of manipulation there is\ndisagreement about why, when it is, manipulation is wrong. Because it\nviolates dignity? Because it violates autonomy? Because it violates a\nconception of liberty?\n\nIt is clear that many nudges are not plausibly examples of\nmanipulation. Warning labels, default rules such as opt-out, providing\ncaloric information on menus cannot count as manipulation without\nusing such an expansive conception of manipulation as to deprive it of\nany use.\n\nNudgers are clear that they want the influence they use to be easily\navoidable. That is why they do not consider making choices very costly\nor difficult to be a nudge. But manipulations vary in their strength\nor effectiveness. Perhaps certain subliminal messages are quite weak\nin their force; only people who already are thinking about buying\npopcorn are affected. Would only the influences that are difficult to\nevade or avoid be considered manipulative?\n\nIn the case of paternalistic acts there seemed to be only one or two\nconcepts which figure in the normative objections\u2014e.g.,\nautonomy, liberty\u2014and they belong to a similar class of values.\nIn the case of objectionable nudging there seem to be a greater\ndiversity of normative values at stake, and they seem to have no\noverarching conceptual unity.\n\nUntil more refined notions of manipulation and of subverting rational\ndecision-making are developed it may be more fruitful to look at\nspecific nudges which strike one as problematic because of some\nidentifiable features they have, and to distinguish them from other\nnudges which lack such features. There may be no common features which\nexplain why those nudges that are wrongful all fall under a plausible\nconcept of manipulation.\n",
