    "main_text": "Some related terms || Epistemic relativism\n6.5 Epistemic relativism\n\nEpistemic relativism is a term with many meanings; the meaning most\nrelevant in discussions on pseudoscience is denial of the common\nassumption that there is intersubjective truth in scientific matters,\nwhich scientists can and should try to approach. Epistemic relativists\nclaim that (natural) science has no special claim to knowledge, but\nshould be seen \u201cas ordinary social constructions or as derived\nfrom interests, political-economic relations, class structure,\nsocially defined constraints on discourse, styles of persuasion, and\nso on\u201d (Buttel and Taylor 1992, 220). Such ideas have been\npromoted under different names, including \u201csocial\nconstructivism\u201d, the \u201cstrong programme\u201d,\n\u201cdeconstructionism\u201d, and \u201cpostmodernism\u201d. The\ndistinction between science and pseudoscience has no obvious role in\nepistemic relativism. Some academic epistemic relativists have\nactively contributed to the promotion of doctrines such as AIDS\ndenial, vaccination denial, creationism, and climate science denial\n(Hansson 2020, Pennock 2010). However, the connection between\nepistemic relativism and pseudoscience is controversial. Some\nproponents of epistemic relativism have maintained that that\nrelativism \u201cis almost always more useful to the side with less\nscientific credibility or cognitive authority\u201d (Scott et\nal. 1990, 490). Others have denied that epistemic relativism\nfacilitates or encourages standpoints such as denial of anthropogenic\nclimate change or other environmental problems (Burningham and Cooper\n1999, 306).\n",
