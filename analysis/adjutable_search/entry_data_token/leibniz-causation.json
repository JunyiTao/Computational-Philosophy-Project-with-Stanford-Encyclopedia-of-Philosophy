Competing Theories of Causation\n\nLeibniz assumes that all events have causes\u2014they do not just\nhappen\u2014and typically considers only three theories of causation\nworthy of philosophical consideration: physical influx, occasionalism,\nand parallelism. Interestingly, Leibniz excludes from this list\nSpinoza\u2019s aspect theory of causation. For it is apparent that\nLeibniz thinks that any view that entails the existence of one and\nonly one genuine substance can not even begin to offer a proper theory\nof causation. Let\u2019s summarize in turn each of the theories that\nLeibniz does take seriously.\n\nAccording to the theory of physical influx, there is an inflow between\ncause and effect; in other words, there is intersubstantial causation\namong finite (i.e., non-divine) substances. So, for instance, when\nJimi Hendrix appears to strum his guitar, he really is the cause of\nthe vibration of the strings. In this case, motion is a mode or state\nof the body of Hendrix and is transferred or communicated to the body\nof his guitar. Interestingly, the term \u2018physical\u2019\nnotwithstanding, the theory of physical influx is not limited to\nmaterial finite substances. For physical influx sometimes is invoked\nto explain the causal interaction among immaterial finite substances\n(e.g., minds) and material finite substances (e.g., bodies).\nAccordingly, it is more accurate to take the term\n\u2018physical\u2019 to mean natural rather than material. Francisco\nSuarez, Thomas Hobbes, Pierre Gassendi, and Robert Boyle, among\nothers, subscribed to some variety of physical influx.\n\nOccasionalism denies causation not only among finite substances, and\nso rules out any inflow between cause and effect, but also within\nfinite substances. In other words, regarding finite substances, there\nis neither intersubstantial nor intrasubstantial causation. Taken\nindividually or jointly, finite substances have no genuine causal\nefficacy. When the strings of Hendrix\u2019s guitar vibrate, Hendrix\nis not the real cause of the vibration. Nor are his fingers, wrist,\nand arm real causes. Is the vibration then uncaused for the\noccasionalist? No, for there is God. God, thought by many of\nLeibniz\u2019s contemporaries to be the only infinite substance, is\nconsidered to be the only real cause. God causes the strings on\nHendrix\u2019s guitar to vibrate on the occasion of Hendrix\u2019s\nvolition\u2014itself caused by God\u2014to strum the strings on his\nguitar. Al-Ghazali, Nicolas Malebranche, and Louis La Forge, among\nothers, were occasionalists.\n\nLike occasionalism, the theory of parallelism holds that there is no\nintersubstantial causation among finite substances. And like\noccasionalism, when the strings of Hendrix\u2019s guitar vibrate,\nHendrix is not the real cause of the vibration. Nor, again, are his\nfingers, wrist, or arm real causes. Nevertheless, it is not God who is\nthe total real cause of this vibration. According to parallelism,\nfinite substances can be real causes. Rather the strings themselves\nare causing themselves to vibrate. Due to the special harmony between\nmind and body and not because of any direct causal relation, when\nHendrix is in a state of willing his fingers to strum the strings on\nhis guitar, the strings are in a physical state that would result in\ntheir vibration.\n\nLeibniz was and is the most famous proponent of parallelism. His\nversion is properly called \u201cpre-established harmony\u201d and\nis usually interpreted to encompass five main tenets:\n\nno change in the states of a created substance is due to another\ncreated substance (i.e., there is no intersubstantial causation);\nall (non-initial, natural) change in the states of a created\nsubstance is due (at least in part) to that substance itself (i.e.,\nthere is intrasubstantial causation);\neach created substance has a \u201cblueprint\u201d (i.e., a\ncomplete concept or law of the series) that \u201clists\u201d or\nincludes all of its states, \neach \u201cblueprint\u201d conforms with the blueprints of all\nother created substances (i.e., each of a created substance\u2019s\nnatural states cohere with all the natural states of every other\ncreated substance); and, \nthis conformity between the states of substances is set up by a\nuniversal cause, namely, God. \n\n\nFor expression of these four tenets, see, for example, Leibniz\u2019s\nletters to Arnauld, Nov. 28/Dec. 8 1686 and Apr. 30 1687, and\nMonadology \u00a781. Consider also this 1704 articulation of\nthe pre-established harmony:\n\nEach of these souls expresses in its own manner what occurs outside\nitself, and it cannot do so through any influence of other particular\nbeings (or, to put it a better way, it has to draw up [devant] this\nexpression from the depths of its own nature); and so necessarily each\nsoul must have received this nature\u2014this inner source of the\nexpression of what lies without\u2014from a universal cause\n[cause universelle], upon which all of these beings depend\nand which brings it about that each of them perfectly agrees with and\ncorresponds to the others. (New Essays A vi, 6, 440)\n\n\nAs to be expected, there is some controversy regarding the\ninterpretation of these tenets; for instance, tenet 2 is sometimes\nextended to also include non-initial states (see Whipple, 206). There\nis another important aspect of the pre-established harmony. A\nsubstance\u2019s expressions arising \u201cfrom the depths of its\nown nature\u201d are also called perceptions by Leibniz. Perception\nis \u201c[t]he passing state which involves and represents a\nmultitude in a unity\u201d (Monadology \u00a714 GP vi,\n608/AG 214). The pre-established harmony consists in the isomorphic\nmapping of perceptions and bodily motions. Whenever a substance has a\nperception x there will be a corresponding bodily state y expressing\nthat perception x. So when I perceive myself as putting a log in the\nfire \u201c[my] animal spirits and [my] blood [take] on, at exactly\nthe right moment, the motions required to correspond to the passions\nand the perceptions of [my] soul\u201d (New System GP iv,\n484/L 458).\n\nNote, however, that the five main tenets of Leibniz\u2019s\npre-established harmony leave room for God\u2019s supernatural causal\nactivity even in the actions of finite substances. In other words,\npre-established harmony, in Leibniz\u2019s hands at least, is a form\nof concurrentism. More of this will be addressed in the section on\ndivine causation, but for now it is enough to say that God\u2019s\ncausal role in the actions of finite substances at the very minimum is\nto pre-establish the concomitance or conjunction between\n\u201ccauses\u201d and \u201ceffects,\u201d without which\nGod\u2019s aim of producing universal and maximum harmony\n(Monadology \u00a7\u00a785ff) would be frustrated.\n\nWhy is Leibniz drawn to the rather bizarre-sounding pre-established\nharmony? In other words, why does he reject the more terrene physical\ninflux and the more celestial occasionalism?\n2. Why does Leibniz reject Physical Influx?\n\nLeibniz wants to rule out any kind of causation in which one substance\npasses something on to the other substance: \u201cThe way of\ninfluence belongs to that of the common philosophy. However, since it\nis impossible to conceive of material particles or of species or\nimmaterial qualities that can pass from one of these substances into\nthe other, the view must be rejected\u201d (GP iv, 498f). Early in\nhis career, Leibniz dismisses the physical influx theory of the\nScholastic Francisco Suarez as a \u201cbarbaric expression \u2026\nmetaphorical and more obscure than what it defines\u201d (Preface to\nan Edition of Nizolius GP iv, 150). (Whether Suarez actually held the\nview Leibniz ascribes to him is another matter entirely.) Moreover,\nthe pre-established harmony can achieve the same effect without the\nmetaphysical baggage of \u201cproperty passing\u201d: \u201cSo\nthere will be a perfect accord between all these substances which\nproduces the same effect that would be noticed if they all\ncommunicated with each other by a transmission of species or of\nqualities, as the common run of philosophers imagine\u201d (New\nSystem GP iv, 484/L 457f).\n\nIt is fairly clear here that Leibniz takes \u2018influx\u2019 to\nrefer to the transference of accidents\u2014today we call them tropes\nor property-instances\u2014as when a guitarist\u2019s fingers give\nan instance of motion to a struck guitar string. Leibniz holds that it\ncannot be comprehended how one finite substance could act on another\nfinite substance. For such intersubstantial causation entails the\ntransference or migration of an accident from one substance to\nanother, where a trope passes from one thing to another, which then\ninstantiates it. Such transference is inexplicable; an accident\npassing (i.e., trope transferring) from one subject to another is\nimpossible (New Essays A vi, 6, 224). Leibniz writes in the\nDiscourse on Metaphysics:\n\n\u2026 nothing ever enters into our mind naturally from the outside;\nand we have a bad habit of thinking of our soul as if it received\ncertain species as messengers and as if it has doors and windows. We\nhave all these forms in our mind; we even have forms from all time,\nfor the mind always expresses all its future thoughts and already\nthinks confusedly about everything it will ever think about\ndistinctly. (Discourse on Metaphysics \u00a726 GP iv, 451/AG\n58)\n\n\nAnd he writes almost three decades later: \u201cMonads have no\nwindows, through which anything could come in or go out. And accidents\ncannot detach themselves and stroll about outside of substances, as\nthe Scholastics\u2019 sensible species used to; so neither substance\nnor accident can come into a monad from outside\u201d\n(Monadology \u00a77 GP vi, 608/WF 268).\n\nLeibniz also argues in this way: If the mind (one finite substance)\nwere to act on the body (another finite substance) thereby causing\nbodily motion, there would be an increase in motion in that region of\nthe world after the mind\u2019s action on the body not compensated\nfor by a decrease in motion in another region. This is an obvious\nviolation of the law of the conservation of motion. Therefore, there\nis no physical influx. The Monadology includes the following\npassage:\n\nDescartes recognized that souls cannot impart a force to bodies\nbecause there is always the same quantity of force in matter [i.e.,\nthe material world]. However, he thought that the soul could change\nthe direction of [force in] bodies. But that is because the law of\nnature, which also affirms the conservation of the same total\ndirection in matter, was not known at that time. If he had known it,\nhe would have hit upon my system of pre-established harmony.\n(Monadology \u00a780 GP vi, 620f/AG 223)\n\n\nPart of what troubles Leibniz about the doctrine of physical influx is\nthat in acting, the cause is drained. According to Leibniz, real\ncausation entails that the cause not lose any of its efficacy after\nexercising its causal power. Leibniz depicts the production of our\nthoughts, for instance, as involving emanative causation: \u201cit is\nvery evident that created substances depend upon God, who preserves\nthem and who even produces them continually by a kind of emanation,\njust as we produce our thoughts\u201d (Discourse on\nMetaphysics \u00a714 GP iv, 439/AG 46). Other commentators have\nput it this way: \u201c[S]ubstances are to be understood as enjoying\na lawful primitive force of action whereby accidents emanate from the\nsubstance, from within\u201d (Cover & O\u2019Leary-Hawthorne,\n181).\n\nIt is hard to tell why Leibniz is troubled by any theory that involves\nthe potential loss of causal efficacy in substances. Part of it might\nhave to do with his belief that even finite, created substances are\nnaturally indestructible (i.e., immortal) (Principles of Nature\nand Grace \u00a72 GP vi, 598/P 195). For then created, finite\nsubstances, continually acting according to the physical influx model,\nmight eventually lose their causal efficacy and would no longer be\nable to act. And for Leibniz, \u201csubstances cannot be conceived in\ntheir bare essence, devoid of activity; that activity is of the\nessence of substance in general\u201d (New Essays A vi, 6,\n65). So, physical influx would entail the natural mortality of\nsubstance, a view that Leibniz wholly rejects.\n\nConsider another expression of Leibniz\u2019s anti-influx\nposition:\n\nNo created substance exerts a metaphysical action or influence on\nanother, for to say nothing of the fact that it cannot be explained\nhow anything can pass over from one thing into the substance of\nanother, it has already been shown that all the futures of each thing\nfollow from its own concept. What we call causes are in metaphysical\nrigor only concomitant requisites. (Primary Truths C 521/L\n269/AG 33)\n\n\nNow, the idea here of causes as concomitant requisites and of God\n\u201cpreserving\u201d substances continually by a kind of emanation\nmay suggest occasionalism, but it is clear that Leibniz, after\ninitially showing some sympathy toward occasionalism, eventually\nrejects it.\n3. Why does Leibniz reject Occasionalism?\n\nOccasionalism puts forward a view where God must act for any substance\nthat does not have the causal power itself to act. But since no other\nsubstance besides God has the causal power to act for itself, or even\nin conjunction with other finite substances, God must continually\nintervene in the course of the world. Leibniz sees this as a serious\nproblem for the occasionalist account of causation.\n\nSince occasionalism entails that God must continually intervene in the\ncourse of nature, Leibniz takes this to mean that he must perform\ncontinuous miracles\u2014an occupation not entirely worthy of\nGod\u2019s name. He explains:\n\nLet us see, however, whether the system of occasional causes really\ndoesn\u2019t involve a perpetual miracle. [Pierre Bayle] said that it\ndoes not, because the system holds that God acts only according to\ngeneral laws. I agree that he does, but in my view that isn\u2019t\nenough to remove miracles. Even if God produced them all the time,\nthey would still be miracles, if the word in understood not in the\npopular sense, as a rare and marvelous thing, but philosophically, as\nsomething which exceeds the power of created things. It isn\u2019t\nsufficient to say that God has made a general law, for in addition to\nthe decree there has also to be a natural way of carrying it out. It\nis necessary, that is, that what happens should be explicable in terms\nof the God-given nature of things. (Explanation of Bayle\u2019s\nDifficulties \u00a77 GP iv, 520/WF 205)\n\n\nNote Leibniz\u2019s definition of a miracle as simply an event that\nresults from God and not from finite substances. However, Leibniz\nadds, a world in which God is required to perform continuous miracles\nis a world less perfect, and thereby less praiseworthy, than a world\nthat \u201cunfolds\u201d naturally without the direct intervention\nof God (Theodicy \u00a716). The idea is that the doctrine of\noccasionalism must hold that God did not initially get creation right\n(even if the occasionalist themselves is not willing to make such an\nassertion) and so must continually step in and repair things to get\nthem to go the way God intends. (This is, of course, not to say that\nfor Leibniz there are no miracles whatsoever. He does speak of events\nthat \u201csurpass all the force of creatures\u201d\n(Theodicy \u00a7249 H 280), including the Creation and the\nIncarnation.) Some have called Hendrix\u2019s guitar playing\n\u201cmiraculous,\u201d but this is not because his playing was due only to God.\nHendrix was a real cause. \n\nFor Leibniz, a world of genuinely active substances is more perfect\nthan a world of purely passive or causally inert substances, whose\nactivity is not properly ascribed to them but to God. Ascribing such\nactivity to God alone, Leibniz believes, leads inexorably to\nSpinozism, where God is the only real substance and where any other\nthing is just a mode of God or else must invoke a deus ex machina,\nwhich for Leibniz is an ad hoc solution (Primary Truths C\n521/P 90; GP iv, 515/WF 221). In order to avoid what he thinks is\nunadulterated Spinozism, Leibniz is keen to emphasize that we must be\nable to distinguish the actions of God from the actions of created\nsubstances. (The success of this endeavor of Leibniz\u2019s is\ndebatable, as discussed in the section on divine causation.)\n\nInterestingly, Leibniz also offers a methodological reason for\nrejecting any view that unnecessarily invokes miracles to explain\nphenomena: \u201cIn philosophy we must try to show the way in which things\nare carried out by the divine wisdom by explaining them in accordance\nwith the notion of the subject we are dealing with\u201d (New\nSystem \u00a713 WF 150). \n4. Intersubstantial Causation\n\nSince Leibniz seems to think that intersubstantial causation requires\nphysical influx and physical influx is unacceptable, he concludes,\nlogically enough, that we must reject intersubstantial causation. But\nNicholas Jolley notes that Leibniz does not always argue this way. For\nwhile consistently rejecting the existence of influx, sometimes\nLeibniz will not at the same time reject outright the existence of\nintersubstantial causation. \u201cLeibniz sometimes suggests that our\nordinary statements about causal interaction can be understood in such\na way that they come out true\u201d (Jolley 1998, 595). Nevertheless,\nJolley continues, \u201cWhen Leibniz simply denies the existence of\ncausal interaction between created substances, he tends to accept the\ninflux analysis; he does not look around for a better analysis that\nwould preserve the truth of our ordinary causal statements\u201d\n(Jolley 1998, 595). So, on the whole, Leibniz does not take seriously other\nalternative accounts of intersubstantial causation.\n\nPerhaps because he thinks he already has an account that will work for\nhim\u2014the pre-established harmony\u2014Leibniz does not believe\nthat a plausible theory of causation need be intersubstantial in kind.\nIn other words, Leibniz does not face a problem so many of his\ncontemporaries face: his metaphysics\u2014unlike their\nown\u2014includes the necessary (and sufficient?) elements to sustain\na properly and purely intrasubstantial theory of causation; a\nLeibnizian created substance is self-sufficient (possessing an inner\nprinciple of change that explains all of its property-instances),\npermanently causally efficacious (acting does not diminish its power),\nand equipped with a complete concept that conforms to the complete\nconcepts of all other created substances (perceiving or representing\none and the same universe). Thus, it makes sense that Leibniz would\nnot feel compelled to defend intersubstantial causation. Like\nreference to miracles, it would be an unnecessary move, and therefore\nmethodologically invalid. \n\nThis point can be alternatively expressed. A difficult problem in\ngiving an account of intrasubstantial causation concerns the\nexplanation of the difference between causation among systems and\ncausation within a system. For instance, do the works of a watch\nconstitute an isolated system? For even Rolexes, constructed for\ndeep-sea divers, are affected at extreme temperatures and depths. So\nthere is a problem giving an account of causation within a Rolex. A\nsimilar problem arises for a seventeenth century philosopher who holds\na mechanistic and materialist notion of substance. But Leibniz has no\nproblem with explaining the difference between systems that are\ncausally isolated and systems that cannot be made absolute; his\nmonadic ontology is readily equipped to handle causally isolated units\nor unities. For his substances are \u201cwindowless,\u201d not at\nall causally compromised by external substances.\n\nThere is \u2026 no way in which it could make sense for a monad to\nbe altered or changed internally by any other created thing. Because\nthere is nothing to rearrange within a monad, and there is no\nconceivable internal motion in which it could be excited, directed,\nincreased, or diminished, in the way that it can in a composite, where\nthere is change among the parts. Monads have no windows, through which\nanything could come in or go out. And accidents cannot detach\nthemselves and stroll about outside of substances, as the\nScholastics\u2019 sensible species used to; so neither substance nor\naccident can come into a monad from outside. (Monadology\n\u00a77 GP vi, 608/WF 268)\n\n\nIn other words, Leibniz writes, \u201csubstances can never prevent\none another from performing those works in this universe as far as is\npossible\u201d (Letter to Arnauld April 30, 1687 \u00a76 WF 125).\n\nIn what follows, I will focus on Leibniz\u2019s positive account of\ncausation. The only real causation present in Leibniz\u2019s\nmetaphysics is that within each finite substance and that of God who\npre-establishes the harmony among minds and bodies (and minds and\nminds, and bodies and bodies). So the rest of this entry will address\nintrasubstantial and divine causation.\n5. Intrasubstantial Causation\n\nWhatever can be predicated of a Leibnizian substance is either an\nattribute (a permanent and common characteristic (GP ii, 227, 257ff)),\nsometimes called \u201cproperty\u201d (GP ii, 258/L 533), or an\naccident (a transitory and individual characteristic (GP ii, 458/L\n605; GP iv, 363)), sometimes called \u201cmodification\u201d (G ii,\n258/L 533; GP ii, 503f). In contemporary lingo, we would call an\nattribute a \u201cproperty\u201d and accident a\n\u201cproperty-instance\u201d or \u201ctrope.\u201d Action is an\nattribute of substance, for Leibniz defines substance as \u201ca\nbeing capable of action\u201d (GP vi, 598). A perception is an\naccident of a substance, for the action of a substance consists\nprecisely in the fact that they are always changing their perceptions.\nNow, an attribute must not be considered a substance, since it would\nbe a mistake to equate action with what is acting, or extension with\nwhat is extended (New Essays A vi, 6, 210f). Neither is an\nattribute to be considered an accident, for \u201can attribute may be\npredicated of several substances at the same or at different times\nwhile an accident can never inhere in more than one substance at the\nsame or at different times\u201d (Clatterbaugh, 1978, 3).\n\nSo, for Leibniz, the essence of a created substance is activity, in\nthe sense of being continually in process of change of its perceptions\n(Letter to De Volder, January 21, 1704, GP ii, 263/L 534). The\naccidents (tropes or property-instances) of a substance are its\nperceptions. The change in a created substance must be caused\n(Primary Truths C 519/L 268), yet there can be no transeunt\n(i.e., intersubstantial) causation (Discourse on Metaphysics\n\u00a714, GP iv, 439/L 312/WF 66f). For causal interaction between\ncreated substances (i.e., monads) is in principle inexplicable\n(New System GP iv, 483/L 457) as seen earlier. Therefore, the\ncause of change of perceptions in a created substance is either to be\nlocated in an uncreated substance, namely God, or in the substance\nitself. But, as we have already seen, Leibniz rejects the view that\nGod alone is the real causal power driving change in substances; as\npreviously shown, he is no occasionalist (Notes on a Reply of\nFoucher, GP i, 373f/L 155). So, putting God aside for the moment,\nperceptual change is caused by the substance itself. But surely we\nwant to know what it is about the substance or in the substance that\ndrives perceptual change.\n\nWhat exactly causes the change of perceptions of a substance? Leibniz\nholds that both the \u201cprimitive active power\u201d of a\nsubstance and its perceptions or perceptual states play crucial causal\nroles in the changes of a substance. (As we shall see, furthermore,\nGod is no minor player in this effort as well.) The primitive active\npower of a substance, Leibniz tells us, is \u201ca nature or an\ninternal force that can produce in it, in an orderly way \u2026 all\nthe appearances or expressions it will have, without the help of any\ncreated being\u201d (New System GP iv, 486/AG 144).\nMoreover, \u201cthe present state of each substance is a natural\nresult [consequence] of its preceding state\u201d\n(Clarification of Difficulties concerning Monsieur Bayle GP\niv, 521).\n\nTo be clear, however, primitive powers and perceptions do not play the\nsame causal roles, according to Leibniz. Whereas the primitive power\nof a substance (some commentators maintain that primitive powers and\nsubstances are one and the same) is the efficient cause\u2014a\npost-Humean might say the real cause\u2014of the change of its\nperceptual states, these states themselves do not function as\nefficient causes. How perceptual states do function causally is\ncontroversial, and we will address this issue later. Whatever the\nfinal details of Leibniz\u2019s account happen to be regarding\nprimitive power and perception, one thing is clear: Leibniz\u2019s\naccount runs seriously counter to David Hume\u2019s regarding\ncausation. In 1748, Hume stated that his definition of cause entails\nthat \u201call causes are of the same kind\u201d (An Enquiry\nConcerning Human Understanding, 156), whereas Leibniz\nincorporates efficient, final, and formal causes in his theory of\ncausation. Before discussing these different kinds of causes, however,\nlet us consider a particularly vexed issue in Leibniz\u2019s account\nof causation: divine causation.\n6. Divine Causation\n\nIt is difficult to distinguish the actions of God from those of\ncreatures, for some believe that God does everything, while others\nimagine that he merely conserves the force he has given to creatures.\n(Discourse on Metaphysics G iv, 432/AG 40)\n\n\nNot all systems of pre-established harmony are the same.\nLeibniz\u2019s own version represents a form of concurrentism, since\nhe rejects the view that the change in perceptual states of a created\nsubstance is due solely to that created substance itself. As he\nwrites, \u201cEach and every substance is the true and real cause of\nits own immanent actions and has the power to act \u2026 sustained\nby divine concurrence\u201d (A vi, 4 Strickland 2006). According to\nLeibniz, both God and created substances are causally responsible for\nchanges in the states of created substances. But God is no minor\nplayer in this effort; God is immediately and directly causally\npresent in every aspect of the universe, even in those effects\nnormally attributed to created substances. Consider these two\ntexts:\n\n\n[God] operates immediately on all created things, continually\nproducing them \u2026 (New Essays A vi, 6, 222)\n\nGod continually produces all that is real in creatures. But I hold\nthat in doing it he also continually produces or conserves in us that\nenergy or activity which according to me constitutes the nature of\nsubstance and the source of its modifications. (New System GP\niv 588f/Adams, 98)\n\n\nLeibniz argues for this view in the Theodicy: \u201cthe action of God\nin conserving should have some reference to that which is conserved,\naccording to what it is and to the state wherein it is; thus his\naction cannot be general or indeterminate\u201d (Theodicy\n\u00a727). So even though Leibniz rejects occasionalism, Leibniz does\nagree with the occasionalist Malebranche that God must be given his\ncausal due. It is certainly not a mere afterthought. In fact, both\nagree that \u201cconservation is continual creation.\u201d Consider\nanother two passages from Leibniz:\n\n\n[T]he duration of things (the multiplicity of momentary states) is the\ntotal of an infinity of divine fulgurations, of which each one at each\ninstant is a creation or reproduction of everything; which strictly\nspeaking leaves no continuous passage from one state to the next. This\nprovides a perfect proof of that famous truth of Christian theologians\nand philosophers, that the conservation of things is a continual\ncreation; and it gives a very special way of verifying the dependence\nof every changeable thing on the unchangeable divinity \u2026.\n(Letter to Sophie Charlotte GP vii 564f)\n\nAnd when it is said that the creature depends upon God insofar as it\nexists and insofar as it acts, and even that conservation is a\ncontinual creation, this is true in that God gives always [donne\ntoujours] to the creature and produces continually all that in it\nis positive, good and perfect, every perfect gift coming from the\nFather of lights. (Theodicy \u00a731)\n\n\nCommitment to continual creation is thus an important constraint on\nLeibniz\u2019s theory of causation. Ultimately, Leibniz adopts a form\nof concurrentism in which the natural change in the perceptual states\nof a created substance is due to the direct involvement of\nboth the created substance and God. In other words, created\nsubstances possess genuine causal powers even while God\u2019s own\ncausal power is flexed everywhere in creation, including that of\ncreated substances and their states.\n\nSince God\u2019s causal activity complements created substances,\nincluding our own, Leibniz does not count such activity as miraculous.\nMiracles are interventions in the natural course of events.\nProperly speaking then, this activity is not intervention on\nGod\u2019s part, but divine cooperation or concurrence. Leibniz\nwrites: \u201cIn concurring with our actions, God ordinarily does no\nmore than follow the laws he has established, that is, he continually\nconserves and produces our being in such a way that thoughts come to\nus spontaneously or freely in the order that the notion pertaining to\nour individual substance contains them, a notion in which they could\nbe foreseen from all eternity\u201d (Discourse on\nMetaphysics \u00a730 AG 63).\n\nShould we take take Leibniz\u2019s word for it? Some commentators are\nnot convinced that Leibniz consistently advocates concurrentism, for\nif the doctrine of continual creation was taken seriously (that is,\nthat God continuously produces all things), then how can anything but\noccasionalism be the natural upshot? David Scott puts it this way:\n\u201cAfter all, it is a fundamental Leibnizian tenet that the\n\u2018degree of perfection\u2019 of a thing is the extent to which\nthat thing acts. [Discourse on Metaphysics \u00a715] Thus, if\na thing\u2019s perfection or action is \u2018due to God\u2019 (as\nopposed to itself) then we have a de facto occasionalism in which God\ndoes all the work. The question here is what sense can be made of the\nidea that God\u2019s conservation is a \u2018support\u2019 for the\n\u2018natural permanence of a thing which comes into\nexistence\u2019\u201d (Scott \u00a74). Scott continues to claim that\n\u201cthe notion of God supporting the natural permanence of things\nis a contradiction in Leibnizian terms, resolvable only if a greater,\noccasionalist-like dependence of nature upon God is admitted.\u201d\nThe problem, however, is that Leibniz certainly does reject\noccasionalism and specifically tries to show (unsuccessfully,\naccording to Scott) that continual creation is consistent with the\ngenuine causal activity of created substances. Perhaps it is\ninescapably philosophically untenable, but Leibniz\u2019s view is\nthat \u201c[God\u2019s action] cannot be general or indeterminate.\n\u2026 Conservation by God consists in the perpetual immediate\ninfluence which the dependence of creatures demands\u201d\n(Theodicy \u00a727).\n\nIt may be tempting to say that for Leibniz we know that God\ndoes act on created substances continually, but we cannot understand\nhow he does this. Consider what Leibniz writes in the New\nEssays: \u201c[A]ll monads were created by God and depend on\nhim; yet we cannot understand in detail how this was done; and\nfundamentally the preservation of monads is nothing but a continual\ncreation, as the Scholastics knew very well\u201d (New\nEssays A vi, 6, 443). Perhaps Leibniz simply adopts the Cartesian\nstance\u2014that God is a sui generis cause, the likes of\nwhich we would be rash to think we can learn anything meaningful.\n\nUnlike Descartes, however, Leibniz does try to explain how God acts on\ncreatures: \u201ccreated substances depend on God, who conserves them\nand even produces them continually by a kind of emanation as we\nproduce our thoughts\u201d (Discourse on Metaphysics\n\u00a714 GP iv 439/PM 26). This suggests Leibniz\u2019s preferred way\nof reconciling God\u2019s creation and concurrence with creaturely\nactivity. Continual creation is to be understood in terms of\nGod\u2019s emanative activity. Emanation is how God sustains the\nactivity of substances.\n\nLeibniz\u2019s appeal to emanation needs some explanation and\ndefense, however. Jonathan Bennett, for one, finds this idea\n\u201castonishing\u201d:\n\nWhen we \u201cproduce our thoughts,\u201d we cause some alteration\nin ourselves; that is, our thoughts \u201cemanate from our\nsubstance\u201d only because the substance has the thoughts, just as\nfaces have blushes, bowls have shapes, and so on. Leibniz\u2019s\ncomparison implies that God\u2019s conserving us is his causing\nhimself to be in some state, which then implies that we are not\nseparate substances, but rather states or modes of God. Leibniz would\nreject that, calling it \u201cSpinozism.\u201d I do not understand\nhis offering a comparison which so obviously implies it. (Bennett,\n245)\n\n\nIt us debatable whether Bennett fully grasps Leibniz\u2019s analogy.\nThe point of Leibniz\u2019s analogy between substantial thought or\nperception and God\u2019s conservation is to reveal two important\naspects of emanation: (1) that God\u2019s causal influence on us is\ncontinual (just as substances always perceive); and (2) that this\ninfluence does not diminish God\u2019s causal power (just as thinking\ndoes not seem to diminish our ability to think) (Mercer, 189).\n\nSince a substance is more perfect than its mental states, the power of\na substance is in no way diminished when it perceives or thinks. The\nactive principle in a substance offers thoughts to\nitself\u2014thoughts produced by emanation (Mercer, 325, 366f). A\nthird aspect of emanation is equally important: Neither the emanator\n(God) nor the emanatee (created substance) is diminished causally. We\ncan attribute to Leibniz the following view: God\u2019s role in\nintrasubstantial causation, besides that which is implied by\nmiraculous intervention, is an emanatory one (Discourse on\nMetaphysics \u00a728; New Essays A, 6, 210f). An\nemanative mode of causal activity is one in which the cause includes,\nin some \u201ceminent\u201d or higher form, what it gives to its\neffect, without losing the ability to produce the same kind of effect\nin the future. But a substance, undergoing this kind of intervention\nor causal process, need not lose its natural causal efficacy. So I\nthink that Bennett misses the main implication of the Discourse on\nMetaphysics \u00a714 passage; the implication is not\nthat we are modes of God, but that our causal agency is analogous to\nGod\u2019s. Causally speaking at least, we are made in the image of\nGod. (This feature of emanation also reveals one shortcoming of\nJeffrey McDonough\u2019s otherwise excellent analogy of divine\ncontinual creation. McDonough points out that \u201cmy freezer can be\nthought of as creating and conserving particular ice cubes through a\nsingle continuous action that begins when a tray of water is put in\nthe ice box, and ends when the cubes are removed\u201d (McDonough,\n2007, 50). This analogy nicely captures the concurrence of continual\ncreation but it fails to capture the non-entropic nature of such\ncreation, for freezers are certainly not 100% efficient.)\n\nThere is another problematic aspect of Bennett\u2019s analysis of\nLeibniz\u2019s thought analogy. He seems to suggest that something\nthat has causal power must necessarily have productive causal power.\nBennett asks rhetorically: If we are to God as our thoughts are to\nourselves, then how can we produce anything? But it would be a mistake\nto think that Leibniz would concur with such an inference. In fact,\nLeibniz probably would not, since final causes clearly figure into his\naccount of the causal power of created substances: \u201cperceptions\nin the monad arise from one another by the laws of appetites, or by\nthe laws of the final causes of good and evil, which consist in\nnotable perceptions, ordered or disordered\u201d (Principles of\nNature and Grace \u00a73 GP vi 598/AG 207). These appear to be\ngenuine causes in Leibniz\u2019s metaphysics, giving potency to\ncreated substances, and helping serve to \u201cdistinguish the\nactions of God from those of creatures\u201d (Discourse on\nMetaphysics \u00a78); however, echoing Aristotle, final causes\nare not productive causes. There is a general moral to be gleaned here\nas well. Unless Leibniz indicates otherwise, it is a mistake to equate\ncausal power and activity with productive or efficient causality. (Not\nsurprisingly, there is a further complication here. For, as we will\nsee in the next section, at least one commentator thinks that for\nLeibniz some final causes are actually efficient.)\n\nLeibniz wants to reconcile continual creation with creaturely causal\npower and activity in order to defend concurrentism, and now we can\nsee that a promising answer (at least as a way of understanding\nLeibniz) is to understand continual creation as a kind of emanation.\nEmanation seems compatible with God\u2019s \u201ccontinual\ncreation\u201d (that is, immediate and direct causal influence on and\ncontinual production of all things) and the power, activity and so\n(relative) autonomy of created substances. In other words, continual\ncreation need not be understood as an occasionalist doctrine. But in\nwhat sense precisely are created substances genuine causes? What\ngrounds the causal power, activity, and (relative) autonomy of\ncreatures? We need to gain a better sense of Leibniz\u2019s account\nof intrasubstantial or immanent causality.\n7. Efficient (Productive) Causation\n\nTo understand Leibniz\u2019s theory of intrasubstantial causality\nbetter (and also to acquaint ourselves with some interpretive\ndifficulties), let us first focus on considerations having to do with\nefficient causation. Then we will discuss final and formal\ncausation.\n\nA point of terminological clarification is needed. According to\nLeibniz, the terms \u2018efficiently cause\u2019 and\n\u2018produce\u2019 are synonymous: \u201cIt must be admitted that\nin saying that \u2018efficient cause\u2019 is what produces and\n\u2018effect\u2019 is what is produced, you are merely dealing in\nsynonyms\u201d (New Essays A vi, 6, 228). Elsewhere, Leibniz\ndefines \u2018efficient cause\u2019 as \u2018active cause\u2019 (A\nvi, 2, 490; C 472).\n\nNow, Leibniz consistently refers to the causal efficacy or\nproductivity of substances. Consider the following texts:\n\n\n\u2026 the modifications which can occur to a single subject\nnaturally and without miracles must arise from limitations and\nvariations of a real genus, that is, of a constant and absolute\ninherent nature. (New Essays A vi, 6, 65 (1702))\n\nAnything which occurs in what is strictly a substance must be a case\nof action in the metaphysically rigorous sense of something which\noccurs in the substance spontaneously arising out [arrive] of its own\ndepths. (New Essays A vi, 6, 210)\n\n\u2026 free or intelligent substances possess something greater and\nmore marvelous, in a kind of imitation of God. For they are not bound\nby any certain subordinate laws of the universe, but act by a private\nmiracle as it were, on the sole initiative of their own power\u2026\n(\u201cNecessary and Contingent Truths\u201d C 10/PM 100 (1686))\n\n\u2026 why should God be unable to give substance, from the\nbeginning, a nature or an internal force that can produce [produire]\nin it, in an orderly way\u2026all the appearance or expressions it\nwill have, without the help of any created being? This is especially\nso since the nature of substance necessarily requires and essentially\ninvolves progress or change, without which it would not have the force\nto act. (New System GP iv, 485 (1695))\n\n\nWhether passive substances truly exist or not, active agencies\n\u201care responsible for whatever activity is attributed to the\nformer\u201d (Shapere, 45). Leibniz\u2019s principle (which has it\nancestors principally in Stoicism) is this: \u201cWhatever is\nfundamentally explanatory must be an active principle\u201d (Shapere,\n45). The purely passive cannot do anything unless it is acted upon. At\ntimes, Leibniz seems to think that only the truly active exists:\n\u201cwe can show from the inner truths of metaphysics that what is\nnot active is nothing, for there is no such thing as a mere\npotentiality to act without any initial action\u201d (\u201cOn the\nTrue Method in Philosophy and Theology\u201d W 64 (1686)). If all\nthings that exist are substances, and the essence of substance is\nactivity, then passive \u201csubstances\u201d do not truly exist,\nsince they are passive, that is, not active (Shapere, 46).\n\nConsider this passage where Leibniz not only attributes causal\nefficacy or activity to finite substances, but also causal efficiency\nor productivity:\n\nBayle asserts, for instance, that by purely philosophical meditations\none can never attain to an established certainty that we are the\nefficient cause [la cause efficiente] of our volitions. But\nthis is a point which I do not concede to him: for the establishment\nof this system demonstrates beyond a doubt that in the course of\nnature each substance is the sole cause of all its actions, and that\nit is free of all physical influence from every other substance, save\nthe customary cooperation of God. (Theodicy \u00a7300)\n\n\nHowever, Nicholas Jolley, among others, insists that \u201c[a]lthough\nLeibniz may say that it is substances which produce their states, this\nis only a loose way of speaking\u201d (Jolley 1998, 605). Strictly\nspeaking, according to Jolley, substance A caused\nperceptual state p2 is shorthand for there is some\nperceptual state p1 such that\np1 involves A and\np1 causes p2 (Jolley 1998, 605). But\ndoes Leibniz indeed take perceptions or perceptual states to be\nefficient causes? The answer is surprisingly unclear. One problem is\nthat (almost) invariably the language Leibniz employs to describe the\nrelationship among perceptions or perceptual states is not explicitly\ncausal (in the efficient or productive sense at least). Leibniz\npredominantly uses terms such as \u2018consequence\u2019,\n\u2018suite\u2019, \u2018sequitur\u2019,\n\u2018r\u00e9sultat\u2019, \u2018tend\u2019, and\n\u2018derivantur\u2019, when speaking of the passage from one\nperceptual state to another (GP ii 47, 91f, 372; GP iv 440, 521),\nterms which should make us hesitate in automatically attributing to\nLeibniz a theory of causally efficacious perceptions or perceptual\nstates. Consider the following representative sample of texts:\n\n\n\u2026 every present state of a substance occurs to it spontaneously\nand is only a consequence of [une suite de] its preceding\nstate. (Remarks on a Letter to Arnauld, GP ii, 47)\n\nEverything occurs in each substance in consequence of [en\nconsequence du] the first state that God gave it in creating it\n\u2026 (Letter to Arnauld, April 30, 1687, GP ii, 91)\n\n\u2026 all our future thoughts and perceptions are merely\nconsequences [que des suites], thought contingent, of our\npreceding thoughts and perceptions (Discourse on Metaphysics\n\u00a714 GP iv, 440)\n\n\u2026 the present state of each substance is a natural result\n[consequence] of its preceding state\u2026\n(Clarification of Difficulties concerning Monsieur Bayle, GP\niv, 521)\n\n\u2026 every present perception leads to [que la suite de]\na new perception\u2026 (Theodicy \u00a7403)\n\n\u2026 subsequent [perceptions] are derived\n[derivantur] from preceding ones (Letter to Des Bosses, GP\nii, 372 (1709))\n\n\nThis is just not the kind of language we should expect to find from\nLeibniz when speaking of efficient or productive causes. Further, when\nLeibniz does claim that perceptions or perceptual states produce other\nstates, it\u2019s difficult to determine if such a claim is to be\ntaken strictly. Consider these claims:\n\n\nAnd really it can be said that the representation of the end in the\nmind is the efficient cause of the representation of the means in the\nsame mind. (Notes on Stahl 1702, D ii, 2, 134)\n\n\u2026 the representation of the present state of the universe in\nthe soul of the dog will produce in it the representation of the\nfollowing state of the same universe, just as in objects the preceding\nstate effectively produces the following state of the world. In a\nsoul, the representations of causes are the causes of the\nrepresentations of effects. (GP iv, 533/WF 78)\n\n\nLaurence Carlin takes these passages to mean that \u201cdeliberation\nof means depends on perceptions of ends in the sense that the latter\nare the efficient causes of the former\u201d (Carlin, 226). Now,\nneither the term \u201cperception\u201d nor \u201cperceptual\nstate\u201d is used in these passages, but in alignment with\nCarlin\u2019s interpretation Leibniz defines perception as \u201cthe\ninternal state of the monad representing external objects\u201d\n(Principles of Nature and Grace \u00a74) and \u201cthe\ntransitory state that involves and represents a multiplicity in the\nunity\u201d (Monadology \u00a714). One problem with Carlin\u2019s\ninterpretation of these passages, however, is that there is another\npassage from the Theodicy that may indicate that these\npassages are not to be taken strictly:\n\nWhen we say that an intelligent substance is moved by the goodness of\nits object, we do not assert that this object is necessarily a being\nexisting outside the substance, and it is enough for us that it be\nconceivable: for its representation acts in the substance, or rather\n[ou plut\u00f4t] the substance acts upon itself, insofar as\nit is disposed and influenced by this representation. (Remarks on\nKing \u00a721 in Theodicy; my emphasis)\n\n\nThis passage can be read to mean that speaking of a substance\u2019s\nrepresentation acting (as an efficient cause) is only a loose way of\nspeaking; strictly speaking, it is the substance, or better, power of\nthe substance, that acts in accordance with this representation\n(presumably functioning as a final cause). More on this issue in the\nsection on final causation, but the main point is that textually it is\ndifficult to know whether or not Leibniz takes perceptions or\nperceptual states to be efficient causes. Of course, all of the texts\nadduced up to this point could accommodate the view that for Leibniz\nperceptions or perceptual states function as efficient causes, for\nwhile the terms \u2018consequence\u2019 and\n\u2018derivantur\u2019, for instance, do not entail efficient\ncausation, they are still compatible with it.\n\nHowever, the above texts aside, there is a philosophical worry with\nattributing efficiency or productivity to perceptions on\nLeibniz\u2019s metaphysics. The question is whether perceptions can\nfunction as active agencies (and so efficient causes) for Leibniz. In\nLeibniz\u2019s ontology, what is active is a true, enduring unity and\na center of force\u2014namely, a substance. Leibniz writes that\n\u201ceverything that acts is an individual substance\u201d\n(\u201cOn Nature Itself\u201d AG 160). To understand perceptions and\nperceptual states as causally ordered, in the sense that efficient\ncausal and not merely lawful or regular or final causal relations\nobtain among them, is to subscribe to an event oriented model\nof causation. But Leibniz, not only like his medieval predecessors but\nalso many of his contemporaries, subscribes to a rather different\nmodel\u2014one in which a real cause must be a substance or\na power of that substance. (More on this in the section on\ncausal models.) Therefore, unless perceptions are genuine substances\nand so not events, it seems to follow that for Leibniz, perceptions\n(and perceptual states) are causally inefficacious.\n8. Final and Formal Causation\n\nIf Leibniz does not think that perceptions can function as efficient\nor productive causes, why does Leibniz even speak of later perceptions\nas natural consequences of earlier perceptions, if not causally? There\nseem to be two good reasons for this. First, there is a purpose or end\nguiding the unfolding of perceptions in each substance. The substance\n(or primitive power) acts efficiently in order to fulfill this end.\nSuch an end may be called a final cause. Second, Leibniz wishes to\nground his Law of Continuity\u2014that all change in nature is\ncontinuous (i.e., in nature there are no gaps). This points to formal\ncausation in substances. In other words, the picture we come away with\nin Leibniz is that a substance\u2019s perceptions, representing final\nand formal causes, rationally determine that substance\u2019s future\nstates. The object of a perception is a final cause insofar as each\nperception specifies why certain states should be produced rather than\nothers. Perceptions themselves are formal causes insofar as they\nspecify the content of a substance\u2019s future states.\n\nLet\u2019s first consider how the objects of perceptions operate as\nfinal causes. Leibniz speaks of perceptual states as unfolding\nspontaneously in monads according to a metaphysically basic order of\ncausal relations. But the fact that perceptions are automatically and\nirreducibly causally ordered need only mean that \u201cprior\u201d\nperceptions contain the reason for subsequent perceptions. This is the\nway Jan Cover puts it: Temporal priority depends on a relation of\n\u201cinvolves a reason for\u201d (Cover, 317). Now, according to\nLeibniz, \u201cA reason is a known truth whose connection with some\nless well-known truth leads us to give our assent to the latter. But\nit is called reason, especially and par excellence, if it is the cause\nnot only of our judgment but also of the truth itself\u2014which\nmakes it known as an a priori reason\u201d (New Essays A vi,\n6, 475). As mentioned earlier, Leibniz also speaks of appetitions as a\nsubstance\u2019s \u201ctendencies to go from one perception to\nanother\u201d (GP vi, 598/AG 207). That perceptions come and go\naccording to final causes is apparent in the following passage from\nthe Principles of Nature and Grace \u00a73:\n\u201cperceptions in the monad arise from one another by the laws of\nappetites, or by the laws of the final causes of good and evil, which\nconsist in notable perceptions, ordered or disordered\u201d (GP vi,\n598/AG 207). Leibniz writes in the same work: \u201cthe future can be\nread in the past; the distant is expressed in the proximate\u201d (GP\nvi, 605/AG 211). The moral is that perceptions function as\nteleological explananda, which is reminiscent of Aristotle\u2019s\naccount of final causation, where natural processes are completed and\nregulated by a final state or end, towards which they tend.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Leibniz does not limit his doctrine of\nfinal causation to the conscious activity of rational agents, for he\nholds that a mental state can function as a final cause without our\nbeing aware of it. In a letter to Sophie Charlotte, Leibniz writes:\n\u201cSo that even in our instinctive or involuntary actions, where\nit seems only the body plays a part, there is in the soul an appetite\nfor good or an aversion to evil which directs it, even though our\nreflection is not able to pick it out in the confusion\u201d (GP III,\n347; WF 224f.). Nor does Leibniz restrict final causation to rational\nagents. (Nor does Aristotle for that matter.) The final cause of a\nplant or an animal is not a plan or intention. Rather, it is whatever\nlies at the end of the regular series of developmental changes that it\nundergoes. \n\nLet\u2019s now explain the presence of formal causation in\nperception. Some thinkers contemporaneous with Leibniz, most notably\nPierre Bayle, found the apparent lack of continuity among our\nperceptions to be deeply problematic. We are often genuinely surprised\nby the content of our perceptions, some of which seem utterly\ndisconnected from and radically unlike prior perceptions. But, given\nthe Law of Continuity, Leibniz cannot allow perceptions to arise in a\nmonad that are radically unlike preceding perceptions. To solve this\nproblem, Leibniz offers his theory of petites or unconscious\nperceptions and says that this apparent lack of continuity in the\nactions of the individual substance results from our overlooking the\ncomplex multitude of unconscious perceptions, which flow, at every\nmoment, from the individual\u2019s nature. But the doctrine of petite\nperceptions alone is not sufficient to ground continuity. Rather, it\nis the rational relation among perceptions that serves to guarantee\ncontinuity in perceptual content. Leibniz speaks of the \u201cmarks\n[les marques]\u201d that each perception of a substance\ncontains for all other perceptions that substance will ever have\n(Discourse on Metaphysics \u00a78). I take it that this\nrelation among perceptions points to perceptions being formal causes;\nthat is to say, a substance\u2019s present states specify fully the\ncontent of its future states.\n\nSo, to summarize, what causes the changes in perceptions? Three\nspecies of cause: efficient causes (in accordance with laws of mind\nand active forces), final causes (in accordance with the law of\nappetites and ultimately God\u2019s aim of universal and maximum\nharmony), and formal causes (in accordance with the Law of\nContinuity). Leibniz\u2019s account of intrasubstantial causation\ntherefore involves a tight connection between efficient, final, and\nformal causes. This should not be surprising, since Leibniz tells us\nthat \u201c[a] cause in the realm of things corresponds to a reason\nin the realm of truths, which is why causes themselves\u2014and\nespecially final ones\u2014are often called reasons\u201d (New\nEssays A vi, 6, 475).\n\nNone of this should be surprising. Hume may have endorsed just one\nspecies of cause\u2014efficient\u2014but final and formal causation\ndid not die with the advent of mechanistic science and philosophy in\nthe seventeenth century. Besides Leibniz, Gassendi, Boyle, and Newton\nall accommodated final or teleological causation in their systems.\nSpinoza is really the only known philosopher in the seventeenth\ncentury who truly has no place for final causation in his philosophy,\nexcept in the sense that artifacts have final causes (e.g., chairs\nserve a purpose and carpenters create them in part to achieve that\npurpose). On the other hand, Spinoza probably does endorse formal\ncausation in his metaphysics of substance.\n9. Causal Models\n\nIt has been noted that \u201c[p]erhaps the greatest difference\nbetween a contemporary concept of causation and a seventeenth century\nconcept is one of model. Following in Hume\u2019s footsteps,\ncontemporary philosophers customarily conceive causation as a relation\nbetween events (e.g., my flipping the switch caused the light to come\non) while seventeenth century philosophers thought of it more as a\nrelation among substances, their qualities, and their\n\u2018powers\u2019 (e.g., I cause my idea of justice)\u201d\n(Frankel, 57).\n\nYet this early model of causation possesses at least one virtue that\nthe contemporary one does not. It has the distinct advantage of\navoiding any problematic regress of causal explanation. Once a causal\nsequence of events is laid out, we can always ask why that sequence,\nand not another, occurred. But an explanation of this sequence,\naccording to an event/event model of causation does not preclude the\nsame question \u201cWhy that sequence of events?\u201d being asked\nof it again and again. On the other hand, Leibniz does not think that\nthe power or will, which are not events at all, but faculties, of an\nagency or agent, need any explaining. The regress of explanation stops\nabruptly with the substance. In a letter to De Volder (June 30, 1704),\nhe writes: \u201cTo \u2026 ask why there is perception and appetite\nin simple substances is to inquire about something ultramundane, so to\nspeak, and to demand reasons of God why he has willed things to be\nsuch as we conceive them to be\u201d (GP ii, 271/L 538). Furthermore,\nthe central message of Leibniz\u2019s essay, Against Barbaric\nPhysics (c. 1713), seems to be that since the actions of\nsubstances are in fact spontaneous, there is no way of explaining\nchange in monads unless we posit some force or power that drives\nsubstantial action. If it turns out that substances just are forces or\npowers, as Julia Jorati and John Whipple maintain, it is no violation\nof this causal model. At any rate, without this agency in monads,\nthere would be no cause sufficient to determine the whole sequence of\nevents and thus no adequate causal explanation of the totality of\nactions (i.e., perceptions) on the part of substances. And, besides\nfailing to break out of the cycle of explanation that appears to\nplague event/event models of causation, such a picture appears to\nviolate Leibniz\u2019s Principle of Sufficient Reason:\n\nThus the sufficient reason, which needs no other reason, must be\noutside this series of contingent things, and must be found in a\nsubstance which is its cause, and which is a necessary being, carrying\nthe reason of its existence with itself. Otherwise, we would not yet\nhave a sufficient reason where one could end the series.\n(Principles of Nature and Grace \u00a78 GP vi, 604/AG 210)\n\n\nHence, we should understand Leibniz\u2019s statement in a letter to\nArnauld (May 1686) that \u201cthere is always something to be\nconceived in the subject which provides the explanation why this\npredicate or this event belongs to it, or why a particular event\nhappened rather than not\u201d (GP ii, 45/PM 60) not in terms of some\nideal event contained in the subject as carrying the correlative\nexplanatory role, but the power or principle of change of the\nsubject.\n\nFurther lending credence to the claim that Leibniz postulates a\nsubstance-accident model of causation, it appears that whenever\nLeibniz describes the causal relation found within substances, even\nthose depictions that are best understood as metaphorical, those\ndepictions themselves point to a non-homogeneous account of the\nintrasubstantial causal relata. That is, intrasubstantial causal\nrelata do not involve components of the same kinds. Whether he speaks\nof the actualizations of an essence, predicates of a subject, values\nof a function, perceptions of an appetite, cogitations of a will, ends\nof reason, harmonies of a rule of order, it is clear that Leibniz\nenvisions \u201ceffects\u201d which are different in kind from their\n\u201ccauses.\u201d The essence of a substance is not itself an\nactualization; the function of a substance is not itself a value of a\nfunction (Cover & O\u2019Leary-Hawthorne, 229); a\nsubstance\u2019s appetite is not itself a perception; the will of a\nsubstance is not itself a cogitation, it is a faculty; the reason\ngoverning the substance is not itself the end to which it strives;\nand, the rule of order is not itself an instance of the harmonious\nagreement among substances.\n\nAll told, it seems that Leibniz ascribes to a heterogeneous account of\ncausation, where the cause is different in kind from its effect.\nUltimately, Leibniz offers a theory of intrasubstantial causation that\nincorporates both efficient, final causes, and formal causes, where\nonly substances\u2014or better yet, their powers\u2014can be\nefficient causes and perceptions have a teleological as well as a\nformal function.\n\nTaking substances as paradigmatic causes may help us to better\nappreciate Leibniz\u2019s compatibilist account of freedom. Except\nfor divine activity, all genuine causation takes place\nintrasubstantially\u2014that is, within a substance.\nSubstances are the causes of their future states and determine those\neffects. However, knowing that a substance\u2019s future states flow\nwith certainty from prior states due its own inherent powers does not\nautomatically entail that all of its states are absolutely\nessential to it. That I must write this entry on\nLeibniz\u2014given my initial states, it was certain or determined\nfor me to write it\u2014does not entail that it is part of my\nessence, my very identity, to write this entry. Leibniz wants to\nmaintain that I could have acted otherwise. And thus I freely wrote\nit, even though it was certain that I did so. \n10. Conceptual \u201cOutline\u201d of Leibnizian Causes\n\nLeibniz\u2019s theory of causation incorporates a variety of\ncauses\u2014some would say a confusing array of causes. To help\ndispel this confusion, an outline of the various Leibnizian causes may\nbe helpful.\n\nI. Real Causes (Only a substance can be a real cause; that is, effect\nchanges in itself or in another noumenally (New Essays\n65).)\n\nIntersubstantial (In which a substance operates transiently or\nbeyond itself. A substance acts on another to cause change; it effects\nchanges in the states of others.)\n\n\nProductive of a natural state (Such acts of God sustain the active\nforce in the monad (Monadology 47).)\n\n\nConservative efficient (God contributes being or perfection to a\nsubstance, analogous to the way in which we produce our thoughts\n(Discourse on Metaphysics 14). This is continual and\nnon-draining. God\u2019s conservation is also special, not general\n(Theodicy 27).)\n \nProductive of a miracle (Such acts of God \u201csurpass all the\nforce of creatures\u201d (Theodicy 249).)\n\n\nCreative efficient (God chooses to actualize the most perfect set\nor totality of compossible substances (New System 4).\n\u201cGod produces substances from nothing\u201d (Theodicy\n395).)\n \nNon-productive (That which rationally determines a\nsubstance\u2019s future states.) a. Final (God\u2019s reasons to\nproduce, based on the formal and final causes of created substances\nand the Principle of the Best.)\n \nIntrasubstantial (In which a substance causes change in itself; it\neffects changes in its own states. \u201cEach substance is the true\nand real cause of its own immanent actions \u2026 sustained by\ndivine concurrence\u201d (A vi, 4).)\n\n\nProductive (To produce a state is to efficiently cause it (WF 56f;\nTheodicy 298).)\n\n\nEfficient (An efficient cause happens in accordance with formal\nand final causes.)\nFinal (What a substance\u2019s present states specify about its\nfuture states, in terms of why these future states rather than others.\nSome argue that final causes can be productive (e.g., Carlin\n2006).)\n \nNon-productive (That which rationally determines a\nsubstance\u2019s future states. A reason-giving cause that is\nexplanatorily prior to the efficient cause.)\n\n\nFormal (What a substance\u2019s present states specify about its\nfuture states, in terms of content.)\nFinal (What a substance\u2019s present states specify about its\nfuture states, in terms of why these future states rather than\nothers.)\n\n\nFree (When acting, the bearer of a final cause is aware of that\ncause.)\nUnfree (When acting, the bearer of a final cause is not aware of\nthat cause.)\n \n \n \n\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Works of Leibniz", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Works of Leibniz": ["</h3>\n<table class=\"cell-rl cellpad-small-dense vert-top\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>", "[A]", "<em>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz: S\u00e4mtliche Schriften und\nBriefe</em>.
