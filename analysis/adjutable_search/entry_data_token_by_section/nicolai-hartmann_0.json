    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nNicolai Hartmann (b. Riga, 1882, d. G\u00f6ttingen, 1950) was\nrecognized in the first half of the twentieth century as one of the\nleading German philosophers, on a par with Husserl, Jaspers, or\nHeidegger. Born in Riga, in what was then called the Livonia\nGovernorate, a German-speaking part of the Russian Empire (now\nLatvia), Hartmann was Baltic German, spoke German at home and Russian\nat school, and at age fifteen went to a German boarding school in St.\nPetersburg. His engineer father died suddenly when Hartmann was eight\nyears old, but left him with a predilection for both music and\nastronomy, hobbies that would remain with him throughout his life.\nAfter gymnasium in St. Petersburg, he studied medicine for two years\nin Dorpat (Tartu, Estonia), decided that a more comprehensive course\nof study would be more satisfying, and switched to studying philosophy\nand classical philology, again in St. Petersburg. Revolutionary\nuprisings there led to the closing of the university in 1905. As a\nBaltic German, he did not see himself directly involved in Russian\naffairs, and, unwilling to interrupt his studies, he transferred from\ncosmopolitan St. Petersburg to the landlocked town of Marburg,\nGermany, to study philosophy with Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131919) and Paul\nNatorp (1854\u20131924), the leaders of what was later to be called the\n\u201cMarburg School\u201d of Neo-Kantianism.\n\nHe completed his degree in summer 1907 with his work \u201cOn the\nProblem of Being in Greek Philosophy before Plato\u201d\n(\u00dcber das Seinsproblem in der griechischen Philosophie vor\nPlato, Hartmann 1908). His massive \u201cPlato\u2019s Logic of\nBeing\u201d (Platos Logik des Seins) and the shorter\n\u201cProclus Diadochus\u2019 Philosophical Foundations of\nMathematics\u201d (Des Proklus Diadochus philosophische\nAnfangsgr\u00fcnde der Mathematik, Habilitation)\nappeared in 1909. All of these show the imprint of his Neo-Kantian\nteachers. Probably influenced by reading the phenomenologists,\nincluding Edmund Husserl (1859\u20131938) and Max Scheler (1874\u20131928); by\nthe rediscovery of Christian Wolff (1679\u20131754) through the work\nof Hans Pichler (1882\u20131958); and finally, by rereading\nAristotle, Kant, and Hegel during the period of a general Hegel\nrenaissance, he began to break free of Neo-Kantianism (Harich 2000).\nWhile he was teaching in Marburg and publishing a number of shorter\nworks that prefigure his later ideas, he was called to serve in WWI.\nStarting in 1914, he served as an interpreter and letter-censor. He\nspent time on the Eastern Front, and then returned to Marburg in 1918.\nBy the time he returned to Marburg, Cohen had left for Berlin and\nNatorp\u2019s influence was in decline, and he was greeted as their\nsuccessor. By this time, however, he was also the furthest of any of\ntheir former students from the Neo-Kantian position (Harich 2000).\nReflecting on his career, he declared 1919 the year he worked out his\nfinal approach to a \u201cnew ontology.\u201d\n\nHe became professor at Marburg in 1920, and then came to occupy\nNatorp\u2019s Chair in 1922. Hartmann was called to K\u00f6ln, where\nScheler was teaching, in 1924, where he taught until 1931. There he\nmet his second wife, Frida Hartmann (n\u00e9e Rosenfeld),\nin the \u201cdiscussion circle\u201d of philosophy students and\nprofessors that he hosted at his own home throughout his entire career\n(Fischer and Hartung 2020). He was appointed professor in Berlin in\n1931, as the \u201csafer\u201d choice in contrast to both Heidegger\nand Cassirer, who were also candidates for the post (Gerhardt et al.\n2015). After the Second World War, Hartmann was elected President of\nthe German Philosophical Association for both the acknowledged value\nof his philosophical ideas and his apparent lack of any improper\ncompromise with Nazism. (For more complete biographical information,\nsee Harich 2000, Heiss 1961, and F. Hartmann 1978.) While\nHartmann\u2019s presence and influence were strong during his\nlifetime, after his death in 1950 his ideas attracted no further\nattention. It is difficult to determine why things have gone this way.\nEven researchers of Neo-Kantianism have completely ignored\nHartmann\u2019s work, despite his intellectual biography and the fact\nthat his work shares numerous features with both Marburg and\nSouthwestern Neo-Kantianism (see, e.g., Luft 2015; De Warren and\nStaiti 2015). Although lack of translations into English and the\nworking of \u201cselective memory\u201d (Beiser 2014) have certainly\nplayed their part, other reasons are needed to explain this situation.\nHartmann has likely been ignored by scholars of Continental philosophy\nnot least because, historically and politically, Heidegger came to\ndominate German philosophy and was antagonistic to him, seeing the\nolder Hartmann as one of his chief rivals. Concerted historical\nresearch is needed to understand this state of neglect.\n\nLike many other philosophers of the time, Hartmann rejected system\nbuilding as the goal of philosophy, but he embraced a systematic and\ncareful mode of philosophizing. He had a perennial suspicion of\nultimate solutions. His open-ended dialogical attitude was not\ndogmatic, and he did not encourage students to adopt his positions on\nissues but to think for themselves about topics systematically. This\nattitude is especially evident in the recently published transcripts\nof his beloved \u201cdisputation circles\u201d (Fischer and Hartung\n2020). In his writing, he adopted a non-speculative, sober style of\nanalysis. His language was clear, and his method was rigorous, almost\npedantic, proceeding punctiliously step by step, without anticipating\nsolutions or taking anything for granted. His writings are organized\nin such a way that the reader is held in check and feels unable to\nforesee the next step in the argumentation. Virtuosic expertise in the\nhistory of philosophy is displayed throughout his works.\n\nOn the whole, he comes off as a \u201cclassical\u201d philosopher in\na time when philosophical fashion seemed to demand anything but that.\nThe explosion of philosophical schools and movements in the early\ntwentieth century, eager for novelty and controversy, seemed to have\nhad little tolerance or interest in patient investigations into major\ntraditional problems of philosophy. He was strongly shaped by late\nnineteenth century Neo-Kantianism and its issues, including the\ncontroversies over materialism, the limits of science, historicism\n(relativism), and pessimism, and was at least inspired by empirically\noriented metaphysicians such as Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881),\nAugust Trendelenburg (1802\u20131872), and Eduard von Hartmann (1842\u20131906)\n(see Beiser 2014). Recent work has also examined the influence of\nRussian philosophers on him (Tremblay 2017; Tremblay 2019). He thought\nof himself as a more faithful Kantian than the German Idealists as\nwell as his Neo-Kantian teachers and peers, honored Kant\u2019s\nmemory by taking seriously the claim that that there are some problems\nthat reason cannot solve, but criticized Kant himself for his dogmatic\nidealist assumptions. Aristotle and Hegel were also major sources of\ninspiration.\n\nRecent work on Hartmann has shown that he dealt with central twentieth\ncentury problems, such as the realism-antirealism debate, the\nreductionism-pluralism alternative, and with ways to resolve the\n\u201ctwo cultures\u201d divide that continues to torment\ncontemporary philosophy (Peterson 2017; Peterson and Poli 2016;\nHartung, Wunsch, and Strube 2012). His systematic and novel responses\nto these problems should be of interest to a contemporary audience,\nwhatever their philosophical pedigree. The establishment of the\n Nicolai Hartmann Society\n has shown that scholars interested in Nicolai Hartmann and his ideas\nare present everywhere, not only in North America and Europe but also\nin South America and Asia. The proceedings of international\nconferences on Nicolai Hartmann (Poli, Scognamiglio, Tremblay 2011;\nHartung, Wunsch, and Strube 2012; Peterson and Poli 2016; Peterson\n2017b; Kalckreuth, Schmieg, and Hausen 2019) and this entry provide\ninformation on Hartmann\u2019s thought that may facilitate a renewed\nevaluation of his contributions to philosophy.\n",
