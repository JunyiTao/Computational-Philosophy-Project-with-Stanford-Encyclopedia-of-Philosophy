Substantiality and Ontological Dependence\n\nTaurellus\u2019s immaterialism about the basic constituents of the\nnatural world derives from considerations concerning the\nsubstantiality of created beings. Taurellus maintains that creatures,\nin one sense, are not separated from God and that, in another sense,\nthey are separated from God. As to the first sense, he argues that\n\u201csince an infinite substance fills out everything, nothing can\nbe separated from it\u201d. As to the second sense, we differ\nnumerically from God \u201cnot with a view to God\u2019s being in us\nand our being in him but in the respect that we differ due to our\nsubstance\u201d (PT: 412). Hence, God is characterized as a being\nthat extends throughout the whole of space. And this means that no\ncreature can be spatially separated from God. The only sense in which\ncreatures can be understood to be separated from God thus must have to\ndo with the nature of their substance. And to differ from God with\nrespect to substance presupposes that creatures are substances. This\nis why establishing the sense in which creatures can be understood to\nbe substances is central for Taurellus\u2019s project.\n\nTaurellus considers the alternative hypothesis that natural beings are\nconjoined with their cause in such a way that if their essences would\nnot be sustained by their cause they could not persist. However, he\nobjects that this hypothesis would lead to a kind of substance monism\naccording to which the world would be an accident of the divine\nsubstance: \n\n\nIf the world is not separated by its substance from God but always\nexists conjoined with him and in the same way will persist to\neternity, it does not subsist in itself \u2026 But it will be an\naccident of God that can neither be separated from him nor persist\nseparately. (PT: 428) \n\n\nIn Taurellus\u2019s view, the world cannot be an accident of the\ndivine substance both due to the nature of God and due to the nature\nof natural things. As to the nature of God, Taurellus argues that\nregarding the world as a divine accident has the absurd consequence\nthat one would have to ascribe to God finite accidents: \n\n\nThe absurdity cannot be avoided that an infinite substance will be\ndefined by finite accidents, for the nature of accidents consists in\nlimiting substances or to define them is some other way. (PT: 430)\n\n\n\nIn particular, \n\n\nit would follow \u2026 that we are the perfection of the substance\nof God because actions perfect the substance from which they proceed\n(PT: 492) \n\n\nTaurellus argues that this cannot be right because, due to his\ninfinity, God cannot be said to have accidents at all: \n\n\nBecause God exists infinitely with respect to substance, he does not\nreceive anything through which he could be defined, which is the\nreason why accidents are as foreign to him as possible since they\nlimit or define substances. (PT: 454)\n\n\nTaurellus\u2019s view that forms are the only beings that underlie\nthe compositional structure of the world contributes to explicating a\nsense in which the world differs by its substance from God. Taurellus\npoints out that there is a close connection between his criticism of\nthe theory of prime matter and his theological aim of defending the\ndoctrine of creation. This connection has to do with a consequence\nthat, in his view, follows from the theory of prime matter, namely,\nthat prime matter is an accidental being. As he remarks, the\nAristotelian principles \u201cwant matter which is nothing by itself\nto be something accidentally. For if this is true, it will be an\naccident, not a substance\u201d (PT: 240). As Taurellus argues,\nsomething analogous holds for the conception of form in the\nhylomorphic tradition: \n\n\nThe natural philosophers have stated that natural forms cannot subsist\nwithout a subject; if this were admitted, they would not be substances\nbut accidents, because substances are not in something or from\nsomething but subsist through their own force, while one says of\naccidents that they do not subsist but rather are in something. (PT:\n318)\n\n\nWhat is more, Taurellus does not think that a conception of matter and\nform as accidental beings could be given a consistent formulation. As\nhe argues, a theory of mutual existential dependence between primary\nmatter and form leads to the absurd consequence \n\n\nthat the effect is in this case its own cause. For what gives essence\nto something else is a cause, a form that cannot subsist without\nmatter is its effect; and conversely because matter is absolutely\nnothing without form, its subsistence depends on its own effect. (PT:\n320) \n\n\nA theory of immaterial forms is exactly what yields an analysis of the\nsubstantiality of elements. This is so because, once the assumption\nthat form depends existentially on prime matter is given up, there is\nno need to regard form as an accidental being: \n\n\nTell me, does nature subsist by itself or does it subsist in something\nother? If you say that nothing underlies it, why shouldn\u2019t one\nbe allowed to ascribe the same to form, such that it is nature and\nsubsists without matter? (PT: 376) \n\n\nTaurellus\u2019s immaterialism about the basic constituents of the\ncompositional structure of reality thus explicates a sense in which\nthese basic constituents are substances.\n\nThe ensuing view of the relation between God and creatures accepts\ncreation dependence of creatures on God but denies the dependence of\ncreatures\u2019 continued subsistence on God. Taurellus gives the\nfollowing characterization of physical change: \n\n\nNothing happens accidentally if not something that is in itself is\npresupposed. The natural philosophers propose this as an axiom, that\nsomething active does not have any effect unless the subject on which\nthis action is directed possesses the disposition to receive this\nactivity. (PT: 266\u2013268) \n\n\nThus, in Taurellus\u2019s view natural things possess are active\npotencies that bring forth changes in other natural things and passive\npotencies that make them capable of undergoing changes through the\nagency of other natural things. These natural changes are determined\nby natural active and passive potencies of immaterial forms, but these\nnatural potencies cannot bring about any kind of change for which\nimmaterial forms do not have a disposition.\n\nThis is why these changes do not carry with them any threat to the\nsubsistence of the world: \n\n\nBecause the world is substance and because one says that something is\nchanged naturally when it is changed in a direction for which it has\nsome disposition in it, it follows that if the world does not decay in\nthis way, it does not carry any potency [for decay] in itself. (PT:\n498) \n\n\nIn this sense, the existence of natural things is due to a divine act\nof creation but the subsistence of these natural things does not\nrequire any continuous divine concurrence: \u201cThings \u2026 have\nreceived substance from him, but they do not continue to receive\nit\u201d (PT: 492). This is the crucial point that Taurellus\u2019s\nrejection of prime matter is meant to make. Only if the subsistence of\nthe forms that underlie the compositional structure of the world as\nwell as their active and passive potencies does not depend on\ncontinued divine agency can the hypothesis that the world is an\neternal accident of the divine substance be refuted.\n",
