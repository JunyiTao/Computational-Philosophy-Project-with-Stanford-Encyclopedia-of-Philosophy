    "main_text": "The Good Citizen: Historical Conceptions || Early Civic Education in the United States\n1.5 Early Civic Education in the United States\n\nAs\n noted above\n the founders of the United States tried to reduce the burdens on\ncitizens, because they observed that republics had generally collapsed\nfor lack of civic \n virtue.[4]\n However, they also created a structure that\nwould demand more of citizens, and grant citizens more rights, than\nthe empire from which they had declared independence. So virtually all\nof the founders advocated greater attention to civic education. When\nAlexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist 23 that the federal\ngovernment ought to be granted \u201can unconfined authority in\nrespect to all those objects which are entrusted to its\nmanagement\u201d (1987, p. 187), he underscored the need of the newly\norganized central government for, in Sheldon Wolin\u2019s words,\n\u201ca new type of citizen\u2026one who would accept the\nattenuated relationship with power implied if voting and elections\nwere to serve as the main link between citizens and those in\n power.\u201d[5]\n Schools would be entrusted to develop this new type of citizen.\n\nIt is commonplace, therefore, to find among those who examine the\ninterstices of democracy and education views much like Franklin Delano\nRoosevelt\u2019s: \u201cThat the schools make worthy citizens is the\nmost important responsibility placed on them.\u201d In the United\nStates public schools had the mission of educating the young for\ncitizenship.\n\nInitially education in America was not publicly funded. It\nwasn\u2019t even a system, however inchoate. Instead it was every\ncommunity for itself. Nor was it universal education. Education was\nrestricted to free white males and, moreover, free white males who\ncould afford the school fees. One of the \u201cfounders\u201d of the\npublic-school system in the United States, even though his era\npredated the establishment of public schools, was Noah Webster, who\nsaw education as the tool for developing a national identity. As a\nresult, he created his own speller and dictionary as a way of\nadvancing a common American language.\n\nOpposed to this idea of developing a national identity was Thomas\nJefferson, who saw education as the means for safeguarding individual\nrights, especially against the intrusions of the state. Central to\nJefferson\u2019s democratic education were the \u201cliberal\narts.\u201d These arts liberate men and women (though Jefferson was\nthinking only of men) from the grip of both tyrants and demagogues and\nenable those liberated to rule themselves. Through his ward system of\neducation, Jefferson proposed establishing free schools to teach\nreading, writing, and arithmetic, and from these schools those of\nintellectual ability, regardless of background or economic status,\nwould receive a college education paid for by the state.\n\nWhen widespread free or publicly funded education did come to America\nin the 19th century, it came in the form of Horace\nMann\u2019s \u201ccommon school.\u201d Such schools would educate\nall children together, \u201cin common,\u201d regardless of their\nbackground, religion, or social standing. Underneath such fine\nsentiments lurked an additional goal: to ensure that all children\ncould flourish in America\u2019s democratic system. The civic\neducation curriculum was explicit, if not simplistic. To create good\ncitizens and good persons required little beyond teaching the basic\nmechanics of government and imbuing students with loyalty to America\nand her democratic ideals. That involved large amounts of rote\nmemorization of information about political and military history and\nabout the workings of governmental bodies at the local, state, and\nfederal levels. It also involved conformity to specific rules\ndescribing conduct inside and outside of school.\n\nThrough this kind of civic education, all children would be melded, if\nnot melted, into an American citizen. A heavy emphasis on\nProtestantism at the expense of Catholicism was one example of such\nwork. What some supporters might have called\n\u201cassimilation\u201d of foreigners into an American way of life,\ncritics saw as \u201chomogenization,\u201d\n\u201cnormalization,\u201d and \u201cconformity,\u201d if not\n\u201cuniformity.\u201d With over nine million immigrants coming to\nAmerica between 1880 and the First World War, it is not surprising\nthat there was resistance by many immigrant communities to what seemed\ninsensitivity to foreign language and culture. Hence what developed\nwas a system of religious\u2014namely Catholic\u2014education\nseparate from the \u201cpublic school\u201d system.\n\nWhile Webster and, after him, Mann wanted public education to generate\nthe national identity that they thought democracy required, later\neducational reformers moved away from the idea of the common school\nand toward a differentiation of students. The Massachusetts Commission\non Industrial and Technical Education, for example, pushed in 1906 for\nindustrial and vocational education in the public schools. Educating\nall youth equally for participation in democracy by giving them a\nliberal, or academic, education, they argued, was a waste of time and\nresources. \u201cSchool reformers insisted that the academic\ncurriculum was not appropriate for all children, because most\nchildren\u2014especially the children of immigrants and of African\nAmericans\u2014lacked the intellectual capacity to study subjects\nlike algebra and chemistry\u201d (Ravitch, 2001, 21).\n\nActing against this view of education was John Dewey. Because Dewey\nsaw democracy as a way of life, he argued that all children deserved\nand required a democratic\n education.[6]\n As citizens came to share in the interests of others, which they\nwould do in their schools, divisions of race, class, and ethnicity\nwould be worn down and transcended. Dewey thought that the actual\ninterests and experiences of students should be the basis of their\neducation. I recur to a consideration of Dewey and civic education\nbelow.\n",
