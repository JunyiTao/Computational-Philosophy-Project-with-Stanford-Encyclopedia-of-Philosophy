    "main_text": "Euthydemus\n20. Protagoras\n\nThe Protagoras is the most substantial dialogue in this\ngroup. Its general theme is the question whether virtue can be taught,\nand this leads to the question whether virtue is wisdom or knowledge.\nOther topics treated in the dialogue are the\n unity of virtue,\n the\n instrumentality of virtue\n for pleasure, and the denial of\n acrasia.\n\nThe two main speakers divide on these questions in an unexpected way:\nSocrates, who believes that virtue cannot be taught, and that he does\nnot teach it, defends the unity of all virtues with wisdom, even\ncourage; Protagoras, who believes that virtue can be taught, and that\nhe teaches it, denies that courage is wisdom or any sort of knowledge.\nMoreover, Socrates, who elsewhere rejects hedonism, seems to identify\nvirtue with a hedonic calculus in this dialogue, through an argument\nthat leads to his famous claim that of\n acrasia\n (weakness of will) is impossible.\n\nThe setting of the Protagoras is striking: the cast of\ncharacters is the same as that in the Symposium, but here\nthey are gathered for exhibitions of the skill of the sophists,\nespecially of Protagoras. Socrates, speaking on behalf of a\nprospective student, prompts Protagoras to say what it is that he\nteaches. It is, says Protagoras, good judgment, so that one may act\nand speak most effectively both in private and in public matters\n(318e).\n\nIn a substantial comment (319a\u2013320c), Socrates understands this\nto mean that Protagoras teaches the techne of good\ncitizenship, which he takes to be the virtue of citizens, and to\ninclude political wisdom. Socrates argues that such virtue cannot be\ntaught; if it could, Pericles would have imparted it to his sons, but\nhe failed to do so. This argument might convince Socrates\u2019\naudience, but it cannot have convinced Socrates, who was no great\nadmirer of Pericles.\n\nProtagoras responds with an enormous speech, often called the\n\u201cgreat speech,\u201d (320c\u2013328d), which is divided into a\nmyth and an account (logos). Many scholars accept the content\nof the speech as Protagorean, although the setting surely belongs to\nhistorical fiction. In sum, Protagoras thinks that the political\nvirtues of justice and reverence or sound-mindedness are necessary to\nhuman communities, and that all normal human beings therefore have the\ncapacity to acquire those virtues to some extent (although not all to\nthe same extent), just as all human beings have the capacity to learn\na language. As in the case of language, the community teaches the\npolitical virtues to its citizens from early childhood on, and\nProtagoras discusses in some detail the traditional stages in\neducation which he believes lead to this result. He also provides a\ntheory of punishment as educational of virtue.\n\nSocrates does not take on Protagoras\u2019 claims directly. Instead,\nhe takes another tack and engages Protagoras in three rounds. In the\nfirst round, he asks about the\n unity of virtues,\n arguing for the unity of justice and piety, of wisdom and\nself-control, and of self-control and justice (328d\u2013334c). The\nseries of arguments is inconclusive; Protagoras\u2019 consent to them\nis grudging, and scholarly opinion is divided as to their soundness.\nThe series breaks down over the issue of sound-mindedness and\ninjustice. It would appear that one could apply a sound mind to unjust\nactions (say, by not letting sensual pleasures distract one from a\nlife of theft). But Socrates seems about to say that both justice and\nsound-mindedness aim at what is beneficial to human beings, and this\nprovokes Protagoras to affirm the incompleteness of the word\n\u201cadvantageous\u201d: different things are advantageous to\ndifferent species, and in different applications.\n\nThere follows a discussion on how to discuss such issues, and\nProtagoras starts a new line of conversation, this one dealing with\nthe interpretation of a poem by Simonides that seems to deal with the\nacquisition and retention of virtue (338e\u201348a). Protagoras finds\nwhat looks like an inconsistency in the poem, but Socrates introduces\ndistinctions (foreign to the text of the poem) that allow him to read\nSimonides as supporting the Socratic views that (1) it is difficult to\nacquire perfect virtue and (2) no one does wrong voluntarily. Socrates\ndoes not believe, however, that it is wise to discourse upon poets who\nare not present to explain themselves. It is far better for them to\npresent their own opinions (347c\u2013348a).\n\nSocrates brings the discussion back to the unity of virtue, here\narguing for the unity of courage and wisdom (348b\u2013351b).\nSocrates argues that knowledge leads to confidence, but Protagoras\ninsists that this is irrelevant, because not all confident people are\ncourageous.\n\nSocrates then approaches the wisdom-virtue question from another\nangle, that of\n acrasia\n (weakness of will, 351b\u2013358d), seeking to show that there is a\nkind of wisdom that is sufficient for virtue. This turns out to be a\nhedonic calculus that gives full value to temporally distant pleasures\nand pains. Socrates\u2019 argument is targeted on those who think\nthat wisdom can be overpowered by pleasure, as is the case with\nsomeone whose knowledge of the ill-effects of certain foods eats them\nanyway because of the pleasure they afford. If the scale of pleasures\nis the only scale of good, however, and if the agents in this case\nhave the wisdom to calculate correctly the pleasure the agents may\nreasonably expect from each choice, then they cannot be led by\npleasure to choose the worse, or less pleasurable course. The popular\nexplanation for eating what we know is bad for us turns out, on this\nshowing, to be incoherent. Some philosophers have thought Socrates\nsimply overlooked the psychological facts of such cases, but Aristotle\nmakes distinctions that allow him to retain the Socratic view that\nethical failure implies cognitive failure without sacrificing common\nideas about human motivation (Nicomachean Ethics 7). The\nmatter was and still is controversial among philosophers.\n\nDoes the passage imply that Socrates is a hedonist? Protagoras does\nnot accept the narrow hedonism of Socrates\u2019 premise, so it\nappears that the hedonism is Socrates\u2019 own. It is not anyone\nelse\u2019s. And yet we know that Socrates is elsewhere opposed to\nhedonism; his solution to the ethical problem of the Crito is\nbased not on pleasure but on what, after serious consideration, he\nbelieves justice to require. There is no consensus on how to solve the\npuzzle. Could Socrates defend his doctrine on knowledge and\nacrasia here without the hedonist premise? In the\nRepublic he will maintain at least part of that doctrine by\nintroducing a division of the soul into three parts. But if the soul\nis undivided, hedonism may be Socrates\u2019 best defense (Moss\n2014). In view of other dialogues, however, it is likely that Socrates\nis using hedonism to build a trap for Protagoras. Absent hedonism,\nwhat could a Protagoras teach that would amount to virtue?\n\nSocrates now renews the discussion on wisdom and courage\n(358d\u2013360e). Socrates presses upon a reluctant Protagoras his\nidea that courage is the knowledge of that which is and is not to be\nfeared (360d), a doctrine that, in effect, he has refuted as a\ndefinition for courage in the\n Laches.\n The Protagoras ends inconclusively with agreement that the\nmatters at issue require more discussion.\n",
