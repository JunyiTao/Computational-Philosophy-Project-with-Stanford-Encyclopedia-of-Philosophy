    "main_text": "Psychology || Instincts/Impulses\n2.3 Instincts/Impulses\n\nAttempts to explain complex, developed behavior by reference to\npreexisting impulses and instincts had already been attacked by James\n(e.g., in \u201cHabit\u201d, James 1890: chapter 4) and Dewey\ncontinued the assault. Such explanations fail to consider\ninstinct\u2019s plastic and pliable character. Across a variety of\nindividuals, instincts considered simple or basic are anything\nbut\u2014they blossom into many different habits and\n customs.[6]\n They also fail to see that instincts are not pushing an essentially\npassive creature, but are actively taken up in diverse circumstances,\nfor diverse purposes. As with \u201cstimulus\u201d, the meaning of\nany \u201cinstinct\u201d depends on contextual factors, which can\ninclude both biological and socio-linguistic responses. But, in a\nphrase, there is no psychology without social psychology, no possible\ninquiry into pure, biological instincts (or any other\n\u201cnatural\u201d powers) which does not also consider both the\nsocial and environmental context of the phenomena studied and\nthe inquiry\u2019s own context. Instincts/impulses are interactive\nphenomena-in-environment, and must be appreciated as transactions\n(HNC, MW14: 66).\n",
