    "main_text": "\n\nCharlie Dunbar Broad (1887\u20131971) was an English philosopher who\nfor the most part of his life was associated with Trinity College,\nCambridge. Broad\u2019s early interests were in science and\nmathematics. Despite being successful in these he came to believe that\nhe would never be a first-rate scientist, and turned to philosophy.\nBroad\u2019s interests were exceptionally wide-ranging. He devoted\nhis philosophical acuity to the mind-body problem, the nature of\nperception, memory, introspection, and the unconscious, to the nature\nof space, time and causation. He also wrote extensively on the\nphilosophy of probability and induction, ethics, the history of\nphilosophy and the philosophy of religion. The ample scope and scale\nof Broad\u2019s work is impressive. In addition he nourished an\ninterest in parapsychology\u2014a subject he approached with the\ndisinterested curiosity and scrupulous care that is characteristic of\nhis philosophical work.\n\nBroad did not have \u201ca philosophy\u201d\u2014if by that phrase\nis meant highly original philosophical theories, and a highly original\nway of approaching philosophical problems. He writes: \u201cI have\nnothing worth calling a system of philosophy of my own, and there is\nno philosopher of whom I should be willing to reckon myself a faithful\nfollower\u201d (1924, p. 77). The reader is nonetheless likely to\nreap philosophical insights from Broad\u2019s manner of meticulously\nsetting out and carefully assessing the theories that prima\nfacie provide solutions to a given philosophical problem. This\nfeature of his writings is aptly described by A. J. Ayer: \u201cThe\nsubject is discussed from every angle, the various possibilities\njudiciously set out, the precedents cited, the fallacious arguments\nexposed: nothing is skimped: looking for reason, we are not fobbed off\nwith rhetoric\u201d (Part of my Life, 1977, pp.\n117\u20138). Broad combines fairness, astuteness as well as rare\npowers of observation.\n\nPhilosophers who influenced Broad were (apart from the great\nphilosophers of the past) his teachers at Cambridge, Russell and\nMoore, and J. M. E. McTaggart and W. E. Johnson; at St. Andrew\u2019s\nhe received important additional influence from G. F. Stout and A. E.\nTaylor. The diversity of their thought is mirrored in Broad\u2019s\nown exceptional range of interests.\n\nBroad led a relatively uneventful life\u2014\u201cnot unlike,\u201d\nhe says in his \u201cAutobiography,\u201d \u201cthat of a monk in a\nmonastery\u201d (1959b, p. 67). He hadn\u2019t been out of the\nBritish Isles until 1946 when he visited Sweden\u2014a country he\n\u201cfell in love with,\u201d and returned to nearly every year. On\na professional level he made acquaintances with several Swedish\nphilosophers (such as Konrad-Marc Wogau at Uppsala University). In the\nacademic year 1953\u20134 Broad visited the University of Michigan at\nAnn Arbor and the University of California at Los Angeles. He writes\nwith great warmth of the \u201ckindness and hospitality\u201d with\nwhich he was received, and adds with characteristic modesty: \u201cIt\nwas good fun to be treated as a great philosopher\u201d (1959b).\nBroad was a homosexual, and never married.\n",
