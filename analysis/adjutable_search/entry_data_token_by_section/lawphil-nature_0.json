    "main_text": "General Jurisprudence || The Conditions of Legal Validity\n1.1 The Conditions of Legal Validity\n\n\nThe main insight of legal positivism, that the conditions of legal\nvalidity are determined by social facts, involves two separate claims\nwhich have been labeled The Social Thesis and The Separation Thesis.\nThe Social Thesis asserts that law is, profoundly, a social\nphenomenon, and that the conditions of legal validity consist of\nsocial\u2014that is, non-normative\u2014facts. Early legal\npositivists followed Hobbes\u2019 insight that the law is,\nessentially, an instrument of political sovereignty, and they\nmaintained that the basic source of legal validity resides in the\nfacts constituting political sovereignty. Law, they thought, is\nbasically the command of the sovereign. Later legal positivists have\nmodified this view, maintaining that social rules, and not the facts\nabout sovereignty, constitute the grounds of law. Most contemporary\nlegal positivists share the view that there are rules of recognition,\nnamely, social rules or conventions which determine certain facts or\nevents that provide the ways for the creation, modification, and\nannulment of legal standards. These facts, such as an act of\nlegislation or a judicial decision, are the\nsources of law conventionally identified as such in each and\nevery modern legal system. One way of understanding the legal\npositivist position here is to see it as a form of reduction: legal\npositivism maintains, essentially, that legal validity is reducible to\nfacts of a non-normative type, that is, facts about people\u2019s conduct,\nbeliefs and attitudes.\n\n\nNatural lawyers deny this insight, insisting that a putative norm\ncannot become legally valid unless it passes a certain threshold of\nmorality. Positive law must conform in its content to some basic\nprecepts of natural law, that is, universal morality, in order to\nbecome law in the first place. In other words, natural lawyers maintain\nthat the moral content or merit of norms, and not just their social\norigins, also form part of the conditions of legal validity. And again,\nit is possible to view this position as a non-reductive conception of\nlaw, maintaining that legal validity cannot be reduced to non-normative\nfacts. See the entry on\n natural law theories.\n\n\nThe Separation Thesis is an important negative implication of the\nSocial Thesis, maintaining that there is a conceptual separation\nbetween law and morality, that is, between what the law is, and what\nthe law ought to be. The Separation Thesis, however, has often been\noverstated. It is sometimes thought that natural law asserts, and legal\npositivism denies, that the law is, by necessity, morally good or that\nthe law must have some minimal moral content. The Social Thesis\ncertainly does not entail the falsehood of the assumption that there is\nsomething necessarily good in the law. Legal positivism can accept the\nclaim that law is, by its very nature or its essential functions in\nsociety, something good that deserves our moral appreciation. Nor is\nlegal positivism forced to deny the plausible claim that wherever law\nexists, it would have to have a great many prescriptions which coincide\nwith morality. There is probably a considerable overlap, and perhaps\nnecessarily so, between the actual content of law and morality. Once\nagain, the Separation Thesis, properly understood, pertains only to the\nconditions of legal validity. It asserts that the conditions of legal\nvalidity do not depend on the moral merits of the norms in question.\nWhat the law is cannot depend on what it ought to be in the relevant\ncircumstances.\n\n\nMany contemporary legal positivists would not subscribe to this\nformulation of the Separation Thesis. A contemporary school of thought,\ncalled inclusive legal positivism, endorses the Social Thesis,\nnamely, that the basic conditions of legal validity derive from social\nfacts, such as social rules or conventions which happen to prevail in a\ngiven community. But, inclusive legal positivists maintain, legal\nvalidity is sometimes a matter of the moral content of the norms,\ndepending on the particular conventions that happen to prevail in any\ngiven community. The social conventions on the basis of which we\nidentify the law may, but need not, contain reference to moral content\nas a condition of legality (see, for example, Waluchow 1994).\n\n\nThe natural law tradition has undergone a considerable refinement in\nthe 20th century, mainly because its classical, popular version faced\nan obvious objection about its core insight: it is just difficult to\nmaintain that morally bad law is not law. The idea that law must pass,\nas it were, a kind of moral filter in order to count as law strikes\nmost jurists as incompatible with the legal world as we know it.\nTherefore, contemporary natural lawyers have suggested different and\nmore subtle interpretations of the main tenets of natural law. For\nexample, John Finnis (1980) views natural law (in its Thomist version) not as\na constraint on the legal validity of positive laws, but mainly as an\nelucidation of an ideal of law in its fullest, or highest sense,\nconcentrating on the ways in which law necessarily promotes the common\ngood. As we have noted earlier, however, it is not clear that such a\nview about the necessary moral content of law is at odds with the main\ntenets of legal positivism. To the extent that there is a debate here,\nit is a metaphysical one about what is essential or necessary to law,\nand about whether the essential features of law must be elucidated in\nteleological terms or not. Legal positivists do not tend to seek deep\nteleological accounts of law, along the lines articulated by Finnis,\nbut whether they need to deny such metaphysical projects is far from\nclear.\n\n\nThe idea that the conditions of legal validity are at least partly a\nmatter of the moral content or merits of norms is articulated in a\nsophisticated manner by Ronald Dworkin\u2019s legal theory. Dworkin is not a\nclassical natural lawyer, however, and he does not maintain that\nmorally acceptable content is a precondition of a norm\u2019s legality. His\ncore idea is that the very distinction between facts and values in the\nlegal domain, between what the law is and what it ought to be, is much\nmore blurred than legal positivism would have it: Determining what the\nlaw is in particular cases inevitably depends on moral-political\nconsiderations about what it ought to be. Evaluative judgments, about\nthe content law ought to have or what it ought to prescribe, partly\ndetermine what the law actually is.\n\n\nDworkin\u2019s legal theory is not based on a general repudiation of the\nclassical fact-value distinction, as much as it is based on a certain\nconception of legal reasoning. This conception went through two main\nstages. In the 1970s Dworkin (1977) argued that the falsehood of legal\npositivism resides in the fact that it is incapable of accounting for\nthe important role that legal principles play in the law. Legal\npositivism envisaged, Dworkin claimed, that the law consists of rules\nonly. However, this is a serious mistake, since in addition to rules,\nlaw is partly determined by legal principles. The distinction between\nrules and principles is a logical one. Rules, Dworkin maintained, apply\nin an \u201call or nothing fashion.\u201d If the rule applies to the\ncircumstances, it determines a particular legal outcome. If it does not\napply, it is simply irrelevant to the outcome. On the other hand,\nprinciples do not determine an outcome even if they clearly apply to\nthe pertinent circumstances. Principles provide judges with a legal\nreason to decide the case one way or the other, and hence they only\nhave a dimension of weight. That is, the reasons provided by the\nprinciple may be relatively strong, or weak, but they are never\n\u201cabsolute.\u201d Such reasons, by themselves, cannot determine\nan outcome, as rules do.\n\n\nThe most interesting, and from a positivist perspective, most\nproblematic, aspect of legal principles, however, consists in their\nmoral dimension. According to Dworkin\u2019s theory, unlike legal\nrules, which may or may not have something to do with morality,\nprinciples are essentially moral in their content. It is, in fact,\npartly a moral consideration that determines whether a legal principle\nexists or not. Why is that? Because a legal principle exists,\naccording to Dworkin, if the principle follows from the best moral and\npolitical interpretation of past judicial and legislative decisions in\nthe relevant domain. In other words, legal principles occupy an\nintermediary space between legal rules and moral principles. Legal\nrules are posited by recognized institutions and their validity\nderives from their enacted source. Moral principles are what they are\ndue to their content, and their validity is purely content\ndependent. Legal principles, on the other hand, gain their validity\nfrom a combination of source-based and content-based\nconsiderations. As Dworkin put it in the most general terms:\n\u201cAccording to law as integrity, propositions of law are true if\nthey figure in or follow from the principles of justice, fairness, and\nprocedural due process that provide the best constructive\ninterpretation of the community\u2019s legal practice\u201d (Dworkin\n1986, 225). The validity of a legal principle then, derives, from a\ncombination of facts and moral considerations. The facts concern the\npast legal decisions which have taken place in the relevant domain,\nand the considerations of morals and politics concern the ways in\nwhich those past decisions can best be accounted for by the correct\nmoral principles.\n\n\nNeedless to say, if such an account of legal principles is correct,\nthe Separation Thesis can no longer be maintained. But many legal\nphilosophers doubt that there are legal principles of the kind Dworkin\nenvisaged. There is an alternative, more natural way to account for the\ndistinction between rules and principles in the law: the relevant\ndifference concerns the level of generality, or vagueness, of the\nnorm-act prescribed by the pertinent legal norm. Legal norms can be\nmore or less general, or vague, in their definition of the norm-act\nprescribed by the rule, and the more general or vague they are, the\nmore they tend to have those quasi-logical features Dworkin attributes\nto principles. More importantly, notice that if you make the legal\nvalidity of norms, such as legal principles, depend on moral argument,\nyou allow for the possibility that an entire legal community may get\nits laws wrong. Any moral mistake in the reasoning leading to a legal\nprinciple might render the conclusion about the principle unsound, and\nthe principle itself thus not legally valid. Since there is nothing to\nprevent judges and other legal actors from making moral mistakes, there\nis nothing to prevent a result whereby an entire legal community, and\nfor a long time, gets its laws wrong (Marmor 2011, chapter 4). Perhaps\nDworkin would have not found this problematic, but others might; the\nidea that an entire legal community can be systematically mistaken\nabout its own laws might strike legal theorists as deeply\nproblematic.\n\n\nIn the 1980s Dworkin radicalized his views about these issues,\nstriving to ground his anti-positivist legal theory on a general theory\nof interpretation, and emphasizing law\u2019s profound interpretative\nnature. Despite the fact that Dworkin\u2019s interpretative theory of law is\nextremely sophisticated and complex, the essence of his argument from\ninterpretation can be summarized in a rather simple way. The main\nargument consists of two main premises. The first thesis maintains that\ndetermining what the law requires in each and every particular case\nnecessarily involves interpretative reasoning. Any statement of the\nform \u201cAccording to the law in \\(S\\), \\(x\\) has a right/duty\netc., to \\(y\\)\u201d is a conclusion of some\ninterpretation or other. Now, according to the second premise,\ninterpretation always involves evaluative considerations. More\nprecisely, perhaps, interpretation is neither purely a matter of\ndetermining facts, nor is it a matter of evaluative judgment per\nse, but an inseparable mixture of both. Clearly enough, one who\naccepts both these theses must conclude that the Separation Thesis is\nfundamentally flawed. If Dworkin is correct about both theses, it\nsurely follows that determining what the law requires always\ninvolves evaluative considerations.\n\n\nNotably, the first premise of Dworkin\u2019s general argument is highly\ncontestable. Some legal philosophers have argued that legal reasoning\nis not as thoroughly interpretative as Dworkin assumes. Interpretation,\naccording to this view, long maintained by H.L.A. Hart (1961, chapter\n7), is an exception to the standard understanding of language and\ncommunication, rendered necessary only when the law is, for some\nreason, unclear. However, in most standard instances, the law can\nsimply be understood, and applied, without the mediation of\ninterpretation (Marmor 2011, chapter 6).\n\n\nDworkin\u2019s legal theory shares certain insights with the inclusive\nversion of legal positivism. Note, however, that although both Dworkin\nand inclusive legal positivists share the view that morality and legal\nvalidity are closely related, they differ on the grounds of this\nrelationship. Dworkin maintains that the dependence of legal validity\non moral considerations is an essential feature of law that\nderives from law\u2019s profoundly interpretative nature. Inclusive\npositivism, on the other hand, maintains that such a dependence of\nlegal validity on moral considerations is a contingent matter; it does\nnot derive from the nature of law or of legal reasoning as such.\nInclusive positivists accept the Social Thesis; they claim that moral\nconsiderations affect legal validity only in those cases where this is\ndictated by the social rules or conventions which happen to prevail in a\ngiven legal system. The relevance of morality is determined in any\ngiven legal system by the contingent content of that society\u2019s\nconventions. As opposed to both these views, traditional, or as it is\nnow called, exclusive legal positivism maintains that a norm\u2019s\nlegal validity is never dependent on its moral content. Legal validity,\naccording to this view, is entirely dependent on the conventionally\nrecognized factual sources of law.\n\n\nIt may be worth noting that those legal theories maintaining that\nlegal validity partly depends on moral considerations must also share a\ncertain view about the nature of morality. Namely, they must hold an\nobjective stance with respect to the nature of moral values. Otherwise,\nif moral values are not objective and legality depends on morality,\nlegality would also be rendered subjective, posing serious problems for\nthe question of how to identify what the law is. Some legal theories,\nhowever, do insist on the subjectivity of moral judgements, thus\nembracing the skeptical conclusions that follow about the nature of\nlaw. According to these skeptical theories, law is, indeed, profoundly\ndependent on morality, but, as these theorists assume that morality is\nentirely subjective, it only demonstrates how the law is also\nprofoundly subjective, always up for grabs, so to speak. This skeptical\napproach, fashionable in so-called post-modernist literature, crucially\ndepends on a subjectivist theory of values, which is rarely articulated\nin this literature in any sophisticated way.\n",
