    "main_text": "The Futility of Inquiry || The Paradox of Inquiry\n5.1 The Paradox of Inquiry\n\nLet us grant that \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s\nrefutation-arguments are in fact successful in undermining the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika project of defending a dualistic\nontology on which the world is populated by things that are distinct\nfrom the self or consciousness. Can \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a himself\ndefend the kind of non-dualism that he endorses? Somewhat\nsurprisingly, \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a argues that inquiry into the\nquestion of non-duality\u2014the question of whether only the self or\nconsciousness is ultimately real\u2014is futile. His argument is a\nversion of Meno\u2019s paradox (Carpenter & Ganeri\n 2010).[24]\n He imagines an opponent who asks, \u201cWhat is the method of\nknowing non-duality, i.e., the non-distinctness of everything from the\nself?\u201d The response is this: when asked by someone who rejects\nthe doctrine of non-duality, this question doesn\u2019t make sense\n(KKh 69\u201373). The argument takes the form of a dilemma: either\nthe opponent is aware of what non-duality is, or she is not.\n\nFocus on the second horn. If the opponent is not aware of non-duality,\nit will be impossible for her to perform the very speech act of asking\nthe question that she in fact has asked. This is because,\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a claims, the following principle holds: \n\n\nAny speech act must be produced by an awareness-episode such that if\nthe speech act is about an object o, the awareness-episode is\nalso about that object o. (KKh 70) \n\n\nBut if the opponent isn\u2019t aware of non-duality, she\ncouldn\u2019t perform a speech act on the basis of an awareness of\nnon-duality. So, she couldn\u2019t ask the relevant question at\nall.\n\nNow, focus on the first horn. The question is this: If the opponent is\naware of non-duality, does her awareness-episode constitute knowledge\nor not? If it does constitute knowledge, then the method by which that\nknowledge arises is the means of knowing non-duality. So, asking the\nquestion is futile. Now, an opponent might argue, \n\n\nYes, we have established in general that there is some way of\nknowing non-duality. But, given that there is a lot of disagreement,\nwe haven\u2019t quite pinned down precisely which means of knowing\nwould allow us to know non-duality. So, the task of the inquirer is to\nsettle that question. \n\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s reply is that this is a useless\nexercise. If we have already demonstrated in general that non-duality\ncan be known, then that by itself entails that there is a particular\nmethod of knowing non-duality. In order to know what it is, we can\neither pick the best one amongst the already well-known methods of\nknowing, or posit a new one.\n\nBut now suppose the opponent says that her awareness of non-duality in\nfact doesn\u2019t constitute knowledge. But surely, says\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a, if non-duality isn\u2019t an object of\nknowledge, then how could there be a method of knowing non-duality? Of\ncourse, the opponent could clarify her position by saying that she is\njust committed to treating her own awareness of non-duality as a case\nof non-knowledge, not her interlocutor\u2019s. Since her\ninterlocutor\u2014i.e., \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2014is committed\nto thinking that non-duality can be known, she can indeed legitimately\nask what means of knowing gives rise to the knowledge of\nnon-duality.\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s reply is subtle: even though he is\ncommitted to the doctrine of non-duality, \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\ndenies that the burden is upon him to show that the method by which\none becomes aware of non-duality is in fact a means of knowing. This\nis because, sometimes, an agent can become aware of the truth even by\nmeans of a procedure that doesn\u2019t yield knowledge, and\ntherefore, doesn\u2019t count as a means of knowing. For\ninstance, in Mist, the agent correctly infers the presence of\nfire on a mountain after mistaking mist for smoke. For some defenders\nof Advaita Ved\u0101nta, such as Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra\n(8th century CE), there is at least a structural similarity\nbetween cases of this kind and the case where an agent becomes aware\nof the non-distinctness of the world from the self on the basis of\nexperience of hearing Upanisadic sentences that proclaim that\nnon-duality (Kuppuswami Sastri 1984: 41; Thrasher 1993: ch. V; Ganeri\n2007: ch. 5). As in Mist, in this case too, the agent moves\nfrom error to truth; for the experience of hearing Upani\u1e63adic\nsentences is laden with the differences amongst the hearer, the\nhearing, and that which is heard. \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a seems to\nsuggest here that the defender of non-dualism\u2014committed as she\nmay be to the claim that there is nothing in the world that is\ndistinct from the self\u2014needn\u2019t have to cite a method of\nknowing that will produce the knowledge of that truth.\n",
