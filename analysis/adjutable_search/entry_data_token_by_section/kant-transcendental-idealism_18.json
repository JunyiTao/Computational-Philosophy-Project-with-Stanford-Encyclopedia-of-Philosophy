    "main_text": "One Object or Two?\n5. One Object or Two?\n\nSince Karl Ameriks\u2019 classic survey of the literature, Ameriks\n(1982), it has been customary to divide interpretations of\ntranscendental idealism into \u201ctwo object\u201d readings and\n\u201cone object\u201d readings. By contrast, this article has been\norganized around the distinction between phenomenalist readings, and\nnon-phenomenalist dual-aspect readings. This section explores the\nrelation between the \u201cone object\u201d/\u201ctwo object\u201d\ndistinction and the phenomenalist/non-phenomenalist distinction among\ndifferent interpretations of Kant\u2019s idealism.\n\nThe distinction between \u201cone object\u201d and \u201ctwo\nobject\u201d readings comes down to the question of whether\nappearances, in general, are numerically identical to things in\nthemselves: \u201cone object\u201d readers claim they are (Adickes\n1924: 20, 27; Allais 2004: 657; Langton 1998: 13; Westphal 1968: 120),\nand \"two object\" readers deny\n this.[54]\n Whether all things in themselves are numerically identical to\nappearances is not at issue, for most one object readers will admit\nthere could be things that never appear to us (cf. B306, where Kant\nseems to admit as much) (although it might be misleading to call them\nthings \u201cin themselves\u201d since they never appear to us, so\nwe never consider them as they are \u201cin themselves\u201d). The\nqualification \u201cin general\u201d is necessary because some\n\u201ctwo object\u201d readers will admit that some appearances are\nalso things in themselves; e.g., many \u201ctwo object\u201d readers\nwill admit that, in the case of the self, there is a single object, a\nthing in itself, that appears to itself as a spatiotemporal object (on\nthis issue, see Adams (1997), Aquila (1979), and Ameriks\u2019\ndiscussion of Aquila in his 1982).\n\nHowever, the characterization of these views as \u201cone\nobject\u201d and \u201ctwo object\u201d is unfortunate, because it\nis not a commitment of \u201ctwo object\u201d readings that, for\neach appearance, there is one and only one thing in itself that\nappears as that object. The \u201ctwo object\u201d interpreter can\nhold that each appearance is the appearance of an indefinite plurality\nof things in themselves. Nor is the other standard moniker, \u201cone\nworld\u201d versus \u201ctwo world\u201d, helpful, either, for\n\u201cworld\u201d is a technical term in Kant\u2019s metaphysics\nand has a very specific\n meaning.[55]\n One can coherently hold a \u201cnon-identity\u201d interpretation\nwhile denying that appearances in space and time constitute a\n\u201cworld\u201d at\n all.[56]\n\nThis section explores how the identity/non-identity debate relates to\nthe non-phenomenalist/phenomenalist debate. They have often been\nconflated by equating the \u201ctwo world\u201d interpretation\n(non-identity) with the phenomenalist one, and conversely, by equating\nthe \u201cone world\u201d interpretation (identity) with the\nanti-phenomenalist one. There are grounds to think, however, that\nthese are distinct debates.\n Section 5.1\n examines whether claims about the numerical identity or non-identity\nof appearances and things in themselves are meaningful at all, and, if\nthey are, what warrant we could have for making them within\nKant\u2019s theoretical philosophy.\n Section 5.2\n looks at whether paradigmatically anti-phenomenalist interpretations\n(e.g., Langton 1998) can be understood as non-identity views.\n Section 5.3\n examines some reasons for thinking that the phenomenalist\ninterpretation is compatible with the \u201cidentity\u201d of\nappearances and things in themselves.\n Section 5.4\n considers the interpretive landscape in light of these\n results.[57]\n",
