    "main_text": "Attempted Total Refutations || The \u2018No Best of All Possible Worlds\u2019 Response\n5.2 The \u2018No Best of All Possible Worlds\u2019 Response\n\nA second way of attempting to show that the argument from evil does\nnot even get started is by appealing to the proposition that there is\nno best of all possible worlds. Here the basic idea is that if for\nevery possible world, however good, there is a better one,\nthen the fact that this world could be improved upon does not give\none any reason for concluding that, if there is an omnipotent and\nomniscient being, that being cannot be morally perfect.\n This response to the argument from evil has been around for quite\na while.  In recent years, however, it has been strongly advocated by\nGeorge Schlesinger (1964, 1977), and, more recently, by Peter Forrest\n(1981)\u2014though Forrest, curiously, describes the defense as one\nthat has been \u201cneglected\u201d, and refers neither to\nSchlesinger\u2019s well-known discussions, nor to the very strong\nobjections that have been directed against this response to the\nargument from evil.\n\nThe natural response to this attempt to refute the argument from evil\nwas set out very clearly some years ago by Nicholas La Para (1965)\nand Haig Khatchadourian (1966) among others, and it has been\ndeveloped in an especially forceful and detailed way in an article by\nKeith Chrzan (1987).  The basic thrust of this response is that the\nargument from evil, when properly formulated in a\ndeontological fashion, does not turn upon the claim that\nthis world could be improved upon, or upon the claim that it is not\nthe best of all possible worlds: it turns instead upon the claim that\nthere are good reasons for holding that the world contains evils,\nincluding instances of suffering, that it would be morally wrong, all\nthings considered, for an omnipotent and omniscient being to allow.\nAs a consequence, the proposition that there might be better and\nbetter worlds without limit is simply irrelevant to the argument from\nevil, properly formulated.\n If one accepts a deontological approach to ethics, this response\nseems decisive.  Many contemporary philosophers, however, are\nconsequentialists, and so one needs to consider how the \u2018no best\nof all possible worlds\u2019 response looks if one adopts a\nconsequentialist approach.\n Initially, it might seem that by combining the \u2018no best of\nall possible worlds\u2019 response with consequentialism, one can construct\na successful, total refutation.  For assume that the following things\nare true:\n\n An action is, by definition, objectively morally right if and only if it is,\namong the actions that one could have performed, at least one of the actions that\nproduces at least as much value as every alternative action;\n An action is objectively morally wrong if and only if it is not objectively morally\nright;\n One is morally blameworthy only if one performs some objectively wrong action when one could instead have performed an objectively right action;\n If one is an omnipotent and omniscient being, then for any action\nwhatever, there is always some other action that produces greater\nvalue.\n\n\nThen it follows that it is impossible for an omnipotent and\nomniscient being to perform a morally wrong action, and therefore\nthat the failure of such a being to prevent various evils in this\nworld cannot be morally wrong.\n\nConsider an omnipotent and omniscient being that creates a world with\nzillions of innocent persons, all of whom endure extraordinarily\nintense suffering forever.  If (1), (2), and (3) are right, then such\na being does not do anything morally wrong.  But this conclusion,\nsurely, is unacceptable, and so if a given version of\nconsequentialism entails this conclusion, then that form of\nconsequentialism must be rejected.\n Can consequentialism avoid this conclusion?  Can it be formulated\nin such a way that it entails the conclusion that allowing very great,\nundeserved suffering is morally very different, and much more serious,\nthan merely refraining from creating as many happy individuals as\npossible, or merely refraining from creating individuals who are not\nas ecstatically happy as they might be?  If it cannot, then it would\nseem that the correct conclusion to draw is that consequentialism is unsound.\nOn the other hand, if consequentialism can be so formulated that this\ndistinction is captured, then an appeal to consequentialism, thus\nformulated in a sound way, will not enable one to avoid the crucial objection to the\n\u2018no best of all possible worlds\u2019 response to the argument\nfrom evil.\n",
