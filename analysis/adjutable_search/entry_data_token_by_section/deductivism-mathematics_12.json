    "main_text": "Applications\n9. Truth-Completeness\n\nWe move on to the fifth and final challenge to deductivism. One\nversion of it, owed to Michael Resnik, runs as\n follows.[18]\n Consider the deductivist\u2019s set theory \\(T\\) and its G\u00f6del\nsentence \\(G_T\\). By construction, \\(G_T\\) is not derivable from\n\\(T\\). So the deductivist cannot explain the truth of \\(G_T\\).\nResnik\u2019s response: the deductivist can simply challenge the\nantideductivist to explain how she \u201csees\u201d the truth of\n\\(G_T\\). Whatever mathematical argument the antideductivist offers,\nthe deductivist can simply extract from it an axiom set \\(T^{+}\\) and\npoint out that \\(G_T\\) follows from \\(T^{+}\\). Objection parried.\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s First Incompleteness Theorem does create a\nsignificant problem for deductivism; but it is not the one just\nformulated and responded to. The above version focuses on how, given a\nparticular theory \\((T)\\), we are supposed to appreciate the truth of\nits G\u00f6del sentence \\((G_T)\\). A stronger form of the objection\ncasts it in more global terms and brackets the issue of the G\u00f6del\nsentence\u2019s truth. What deductivism appears to get wrong is that\nit disrespects the entrenched understanding of most parts of\nmathematics as truth-complete: for any precisely formulated\nsentence \\(p\\) from a truth-complete area of mathematics, exactly one\nof \\(p\\) and not-p is true. Analysis and arithmetic are\nexamples of areas standardly understood to be truth-complete. It is\nstandardly thought, for example, that a statement such as\nGoldbach\u2019s Conjecture is true or false, even if it turns out to\nbe unprovable from any reasonable axioms, not just present\n ones.[19]\n But on the deductivist view, undecidable sentences in any\nformalisation of arithmetic and analysis are false and their negations\nare also false, since neither deductively follows from the axioms.\nThat there are undecidable sentences follows from G\u00f6del\u2019s\nFirst Incompleteness Theorem together with standard constraints on\ndeductive\n systems.[20]\n Hence deductivism misdescribes our understanding of truth-complete\nbranches of mathematics such as arithmetic, analysis and geometry.\n\nThis objection seems to affect two of the three variants of\ndeductivism we identified at the end of\n \u00a74:\n local deductivism and ZFC-deductivism. A form of deductivism the\nG\u00f6delian objection does not affect is constructivist deductivism,\nbecause constructivists do not assume the law of excluded middle in\nmathematics, so do not assume truth-completeness. Though, as we\nglimpsed in the discussion of Brouwer\n (\u00a73.5),\n constructivists do not tend to be deductivists.\n\nSticking to classical-logic-using deductivism, its proponent could\nrespond to the objection by idealising the axiom system or the proof\nsystem or both. The first approach is to construe \u201c\\(2 + 2 =\n4\\)\u201d as:\n\n\nthe sentence \u201c\\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\u201d deductively follows from the\nideal axioms of arithmetic\n\n\nThe resulting position is essentially whatever-it-takes deductivism,\nmentioned in\n \u00a74.\n It adds a little more detail to the position articulated in\n \u00a74\n in that the ideal axioms of arithmetic by stipulation give rise to a\ncomplete system, in order to overcome the present objection. (Of\ncourse, an informal version of whatever-it-takes deductivism would\nevade the objection altogether, because it is not based on a formal\nsystem. But critics will retort that it does so only because its\naccount of mathematical truth is inherently vague.) The second sort of\napproach might, for example, take the proof system to include\ninfinitary rules of reasoning, such as the omega-rule, which, as is\nwell-known, restores completeness if added to first-order Peano\n Arithmetic.[21]\n\nIdealising deductivism in either of these ways, however, is not to\nrescue but to abandon it. Any combined axiom-and-proof system that is\nconsistent, deductively complete and strong enough to capture all the\ntruths of mathematics lacks an effective proof procedure, by\nG\u00f6del\u2019s First Incompleteness Theorem. To see this, consider\nsay the deductive \u201csystem\u201d whose \u201ctheorems\u201d\nconsist of all the true sentences of\n arithmetic.[22]\n Assuming the Church\u2013Turing thesis, this list of\n\u201ctheorems\u201d cannot be generated by any mechanical proof\nprocedure (i.e., algorithm). Idealised deductivism is thus eliminative\nstructuralism in thin disguise, since it advocates taking as the\ncombined axiom-and-proof system whatever it takes to capture the\nstructural content of the axioms, be it by beefing up the axioms or\nthe \u201cproof\u201d system or both. If the idea is that\nmathematicians take a sentence to be true if and only if it is a\nlogical consequence of the semantic content of\nstructure-characterising axioms, one should come clean and accept\ndeductivism\u2019s semantic counterpart: eliminative structuralism.\nThe clear moral is that what lands deductivism in trouble is its focus\non syntax. Instead of taking a syntactic turn as it did in the late\nnineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the \u201cmathematical\nstatements are conditional on axioms\u201d idea must instead take a\nsemantic form.\n\nDeductivists might try another defence. We quoted Curry in\n \u00a73.4\n as holding that \u201call formal systems stand on a par\u201d. And\nthis is surely a thought many deductivists will find attractive: in\nprinciple, any formal system is acceptable, the differences between\none formal system and another being owed to the fact that one of them\nis better suited to applications, or to the fact that one of the\nsystems happens to be the one \\(we\\) use, and so on. So, for the\ndeductivist, if the axioms of arithmetic \\(Ax\\) we explicitly or\nimplicitly accept are incomplete, then any arithmetical sentence \\(p\\)\nnot decided by them is neither true nor false, precisely because its\ntruth-value is relativised to deducibility from \\(Ax\\). Of course, we\ncan strengthen \\(Ax\\) in one way to derive \\(p\\) and in another way to\nderive not-\\(p\\), and in those respective strengthenings \\(p\\) will be\nrespectively true and false. This, it appears, is Curry\u2019s\nsuggestion about how deductivists should react to G\u00f6del\u2019s\nresult.\n\nThe resulting pluralist position rejects truth-completeness for a\nprincipled reason. But it rejects it nonetheless, and that must count\nas a significant cost. For the truth-completeness of arithmetic is a\nfundamental commitment of mathematics, and permeates most of our\nthinking about the natural numbers. (A similar point applies to many\nother areas.) Some would say that respecting it is a non-negotiable\nconstraint on a philosophy of mathematics. Of course, the\ntruth-completeness objection challenges deductivism only in certain\nareas of mathematics\u2014specifically those typically held to be\ntruth-complete but for which no deductively complete, consistent\naxiomatisation exists. A complete theory-axiomatisation may be\nprovided even in first-order logic not just for finite structures but\nfor some infinite ones as\n well.[23]\n Thus one could still try to defend a deductivism about all other\nareas. But there is great value in having a uniform philosophy of\nmathematics. More importantly, given deductivism\u2019s motivations,\nas outlined in\n \u00a72,\n it is hard to see what the point of this sort of eclectic deductivism\nmight be.\n\nTruth-completeness presents the deductivist with a formidable\nchallenge. To meet it, she cannot privilege any system of arithmetic\nover any other by maintaining that \u201cPA is consistent\u201d is\ntrue in one system and false in another. The post-G\u00f6delian\nrealisation that eliminative structuralism fares better\nhere\u2014because it allows for the possibility of truth-completeness\nif we move to an incompletable semantic consequence relation\u2014led\nto structuralism\u2019s gain in popularity at the expense of\ndeductivism in the second half of the twentieth century.\n",
