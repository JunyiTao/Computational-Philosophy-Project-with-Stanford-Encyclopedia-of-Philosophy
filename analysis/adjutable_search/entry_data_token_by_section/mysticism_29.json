    "main_text": "Epistemology || A Critique of Naturalist Explanations\n9.8 A Critique of Naturalist Explanations\n\nBertrand Russell (1935, 188) once quipped that \u201cWe can make no\ndistinction between the man who eats little and sees heaven and the\nman who drinks much and sees snakes. Each is in an abnormal physical\ncondition, and therefore has abnormal perceptions.\u201d C.D. Broad (1935,\n164) wrote, to the contrary, \u201cOne might need to be slightly\n\u2018cracked\u2019 in order to have some peep-holes into the\nsuper-sensible world.\u201d Thus, the issue is engaged whether we can\nexplain away religious and mystical experiences by reference to\nnatural causes. Can science \u201cexplain away\u201d mystical\nexperiences by showing that \u201cIt\u2019s all in the head\u201d?\n\nIf all mystics had a demonstrable pathology or brain-defect, a\nnaturalist explanation would carry great weight. However, that is\nnot the case. Naturalist proposals often exaggerate the scope and\ninfluence of the cited factors, sometimes choosing to highlight what\nis eye-catching at the expense of the more common\noccurrences.\n\nFor an example of the overreach and problem of simple reductive\nexplanations, consider a popular pathological explanation: temporal\nlobe epileptic seizures (e.g., Persinger 1987, 111).\nHowever, ecstatic experiences of well-being, self-transcendence, and\ncertainty from temporal lobe epileptic seizures are very rare (1% to\n2% of patients) (Devinsky and Lai 2008). That may be\nsignificantly less common than in the general population. Nor are all\nmystical experiences \u201cecstatic\u201d in the emotional sense \u2014\nserenity and calm characterize many mystical experiences. The\nepileptic experiences usually last only a few seconds out of a larger\nepisode and usually are not a matter of joy but fear and anxiety\n(Kelly and Grosso 2007, 531\u2013534). If seizures were the cause,\nwhy the vast majority of patients do not have mystical experiences\nwould have to be explained. Moreover, visions and voices are more\ncommon than mystical experiences for these patients. Mystical\nexperiences have a different phenomenological content, but studies\naligned with the temporolimbic model truncate and misrepresent the\n\u201cfelt\u201d phenomenological features of mystical experiences (Bradford\n2013, 113).\n\nNor can we simply assume that mystics in the past must have had some\npathology despite their lack of observable symptoms \u2014\na study of medieval Christian mystics and ascetics did not turn\nup evidence of any major forms of mental illness such as schizophrenia\nor manic-depressive disorder (Kroll and Bachrach 2005).\nToday mystical experiences have been correlated with healthy\nindices of personality and adjustment (Hood and Byrom 2010, Griffiths\net al. 2011). Mystical experiences also more often correlate with\npositive changes in family life, reduced fear of death, better health,\nand a greater sense of purpose, although some patients do require\ntherapeutic care, than do pathological experiences (Yaden et al.\n2017, 59). The loss of a sense of self outside of mystical experiences\nis associated with maladaptive outcomes such as a sense of\ndisconnection to other people and a loss of empathy (Yaden et al.\n2017, 59). The pathology model does not explain any of this. It also\nmakes emotion, rather than cognition, the central feature of mystical\nexperiences, and this does not jibe with the historical record\n(Bradford 2013).\n\nIn sum, these pathologies may be one possible trigger, but they are\nnot a total explanation. Secondly, at least some of the proposals are\nperfectly compatible with the validity of claims that mystics\nexperience a transcendent reality. For example, a person\u2019s\nreligious mental set can just as well be a condition for enjoying and\nbeing capable of recognizing an experience of God as it can\nbe a cause of delusion. However, there might be\nnaturalist explanations that would make it implausible that God\nwould appear in just certain ways.\n9.8.1 Evaluation of Neuropsychological Explanations\n\nIn principle, neuroscience can give as complete an account of brain\nactivity during a mystical experience as it can for any conscious\nevent or state. But a neuropsychological theory can do no more\nthan relate what happens in the brain when a mystical experience\noccurs, and merely identifying the activity does not discredit\nmystical claims any more than a neurological account of perception\ndiscredits sense-experience as cognitive \u2014 all human\nexperiences have some grounding in neural activity.\nNeurology cannot tell us that the ultimate cause of brain events\nis altogether internal to the organism. True, there may not\nbe \u201cGod-receptors\u201d in the body, analogous to those\nfor sensory perception, and this might reinforce a suspicion that\nit\u2019s all in the head. However, such receptors are neither to be\nexpected nor required with non-physical stimuli, as in mystical\nexperiences. For example, God, Brahman, or the Dao would not\nexist at a physical distance from the brain. Thus, God could act\ndirectly upon the brain to bring about the relevant processes for a\nsubject to perceive God or otherwise use a natural medium\n(see Wainwright 1981, chap. 2). In sum, simply identifying and\nexplaining what is occurring in the brain while a mystical experience\nis occurring is neutral to whether that is all there is to producing\nthe experience.\n\nPlausible natural explanations would tend to discredit religious\nexplanations of mystical experiences only if people with pathologies\nor negative psychological conditions had mystical experiences.\nBut as noted in the last section, that is not the\ncase. Nevertheless, plausible natural explanations do\nweaken the religious case by offering a reasonable\nalternative \u2014 there is competition for the best explanation\nwhere before there was none.\n9.8.2 The Claimed Superiority of Naturalist Explanation\n\nSome philosophers have argued that because the \u201cmodern\ninquirer\u201d assumes everything is ultimately explicable in\nnaturalist terms, we should in principle reject any supernatural\nexplanation of mystical experience (see Bagger 1999). Invoking\nGod to explain mystical experiences is like invoking miracles to\nexplain natural phenomena. We should match our elimination of miracles\nfrom our explanatory vocabulary with an elimination of a supernatural\nexplanation of mystical experiences of God. Hence, we do not have to\nwait until we discover a live alternative explanation to the theistic\nexplanation of mystical experiences of God. We should resist any\ntheistic explanation in the name of our epistemic standards.\n\nThis argument raises the important question of the relationship\nbetween theistic explanation and a naturalist program of\nexplanation. Arguments have been presented for the compatibility of\nreligion and natural science (e.g., Swinburne 1989 and Plantinga\n2011). Of course, a person for whom supernatural explanations\nare not a live option would have reason to reject the Argument\nfrom Experience and refuse to engage in a doxastic practice of\nidentifying valid God-experiences. However, most defenders of the\nArgument from Experience advance it as at best a defensible line of\nreasoning rather than as a proof of valid experiences of God that\nshould convince anyone, and the Doxastic Practice Approach is not\nmeant to convince everybody to participate in a theistic doxastic\npractice (see Gellman 2001b). The bar is lowered from advancing\nassent-compelling proofs to establishing merely the\nrationality of participation in a doxastic practice that\nwould justify belief.\n",
