    "main_text": "\n\n\nWhat are the metaphysical implications of quantum physics? One way of\napproaching this question is to consider the impact of the theory on\nour understanding of objects as individuals with well defined identity\nconditions. According to the \u2018Received View\u2019, which was\nelaborated as the quantum revolution was taking place, quantum theory\nimplies that the fundamental particles of physics cannot be regarded\nas individual objects in this sense. Such a view has motivated the\ndevelopment of non-standard formal systems which are appropriate for\nrepresenting non-individual objects. However, it has also been argued\nthat quantum physics is in fact compatible with a metaphysics of\nindividual objects, but that such objects are indistinguishable in a\nsense which leads to the violation of Leibniz\u2019s famous Principle of\nthe Identity of Indiscernibles. This last claim has also been\ncontested opening up a further way of understanding the individuality of quantum entities. As a result, we are faced with a form of\nunderdetermination of the relevant metaphysics by the physics, in\nwhich we have, on the one hand, quantum objects-as-individuals and, on\nthe other, quantum objects-as-non-individuals. It has been argued that\nthis underdetermination of such fundamental metaphysical \u2018packages\u2019\nhas important implications for the realism-antirealism debate.\n\n",
