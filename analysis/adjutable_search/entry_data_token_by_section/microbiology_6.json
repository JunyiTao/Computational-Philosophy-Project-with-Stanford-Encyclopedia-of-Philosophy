    "main_text": "Microbes as Models || Virtues of microbial models\n4.1 Virtues of microbial models\n\nWhile physical models of various sorts are used throughout the\nsciences, model organisms are a kind of model system particular to the\nlife sciences. \u201cModel organism\u201d typically refers to the\norganisms that are bred, propagated, and studied in laboratories in\nthe biomedical and life sciences. Classic animal examples include\nnematodes (\u201cworms\u201d), Drosophila (fruit flies) and\nmice. An important plant model is Arabidopsis\n(mustard cress). Fungi are represented by yeast, which is also used to\nmodel all eukaryotes (Botstein & Fink 2011). While a wealth of\nimportant model organism research is carried out on relatively large\norganisms, microbes are regarded as especially tractable model\nsystems. This is very much the case in experimental evolution and\necology, where microbial systems allow researchers to study dynamical\nprocesses in large populations over many generations. These modelling\ncapacities have general philosophical implications.\n\nThe methodology and epistemology of modelling with model organisms is\na topic of increasing discussion in the history and philosophy of\nscience (Ankeny & Leonelli 2011; Endersby 2007; see also the\n SEP entry on experiment in biology).\n These discussions include recent debates about what sorts of models\nmodel organisms are, and whether they qualify as genuine models. A\nnumber of philosophers of modelling classify model organisms in the\nsame category as other physical analogue models, such as the model\nairplanes used in studies of aerodynamics or the sandboxes used to\nmodel geological processes in laboratories (Weisberg 2013;\nMcClay and Dooley 1995;\n SEP entry on models in science).\n However, Levy & Currie (2015) object to this practice, arguing\nthat model organisms are not theoretical models in the sense of\ninterpreted structures studied as analogues of target systems in the\nnatural world. Instead, they see organismal models as specimens of\n(and thereby bases for extrapolation about) broader classes of\norganisms. Levy and Currie do, however, concede that in some contexts,\nsuch as experimental evolution and ecology, organismal models can play\na very similar role to that of theoretical models. Microbes are common\nchoices for this role as analogue systems in experimental\nsettings.\n\nAn early illustration of how such organismal analogues work can be\nfound in Georgii Gause\u2019s work in the 1930s modelling\ninterspecies competition. Gause wanted a simple, easily manipulable\nlaboratory system that would allow him to \u201celiminate the\ncomplicating influence of numerous secondary factors\u201d and\n\u201cunderstand the mechanism of the elementary process of the\nstruggle for existence\u201d (Gause 1934a: 92, 6). In order to\nrepresent in physical terms the logistic equation that models carrying\ncapacities for populations, Gause set up an experimental system of\npopulations of two species of paramecia, Paramecium caudatum\nand P. aurelia, both of which eat bacteria. Gause anticipated\nthat indirect competition between the species would modify one\nspecies\u2019 carrying capacity. When the paramecia were physically\nseparated, each population reached growth equilibrium, but when they\nwere put together and made to compete for the same limiting bacterial\nresources, one species drove the other extinct. This extrapolation\nfrom the logistic equation is nowadays known as the competitive\nexclusion principle, and has become a central principle in ecology\n(Hardin 1960). The mathematical and experimental model reached the\nsame conclusions.\n\nHowever, Gause then tried to use a microbial model to demonstrate the\nbasic mechanisms represented in another mathematical model of direct\ninterspecies competition (in the form of predator-prey relationships),\nthe Lotka-Volterra equations. In this case, his experimental system\nrepeatedly failed to capture the oscillating dynamics of the\nequations. This time he used one of the paramecia (P.\ncaudatum) and its unicellular predator, Didinium\nnasutum. Both species went extinct, unless Gause introduced\nadditional physical parameters or modified the mathematics (Gause\n1934b). Does this suggest that microbes simply cannot capture the\nappropriate dynamics and are unreliable as experimental\nrepresentations of mathematical models? In fact, an extensive history\nof subsequent experimentation found that the long-term oscillations\npredicted by the Lotka-Volterra equations are unrealized in\nany organismal model system unless major alterations are made\nto the basic variables. Only very recently have these oscillations\nbeen achieved over numerous generations, in an experimental model\nconsisting of unicellular algae and a microscopic metazoan predator\n(Blasius et al.\n 2020).[7]\n\n\nAn iconic contemporary example of microbial modelling is Richard\nLenski\u2019s long-term evolution experiment (Fox & Lenski 2015).\nLenski\u2019s group used a single ancestral genome of E.\ncoli to found twelve initially genetically identical populations\nin identical flask environments. They began propagating the\npopulations, by transferring a population sample from a well-mixed\nflask to a fresh flask (to replenish their resources) every 24 hours.\nLenski\u2019s group began this experiment in 1988 and it is still\ngoing today, which in early 2020 means more than 70,000 generations of\nmicrobial evolution have\n occurred.[8]\n These numbers are due to E. coli populations regenerating\njust over six times per day, with resource constraints keeping this\nnumber steady.\n\nA key original motivation of the experiment was to learn more about\nthe long-term dynamics of adaptation and diversification by studying\nevolution in real time, in a controlled setting. Because the\npopulations started out exactly the same and live in identical\nenvironments, any differences in fitness, physiology or morphology\nthat arise over time are due entirely to new mutations in clonal\nlineages (not prone to recombination). Many insights have arisen from\nthe long-term evolution experiment, including inferences about the\ndynamics of mutation, the role of chance in evolutionary trajectories,\nand the evolutionary origin of complex novel features (Fox and Lenski\n2015). While in a few cases these findings are restricted to\ninferences specifically about E. coli and similar bacteria\n(e.g., Sniegowski et al. 1997), most are considered to apply to the\nprocesses and dynamics of long-term evolution in general. In other\nwords, the microbes in the laboratory are not modelling microbes\nexclusively, but rather serving as a lens through which to understand\nmore generally the phenomena of evolving life. In some important\nrespects, these experimental systems are run like algorithms: exact\niterative procedures that lead to various outcomes, and which can be\nlooped and rerun at various points in the overall procedure.\n\nAlgorithms are of course the basis for computational simulations.\nPerhaps inspired by these structural similarities, Lenski\u2019s\ngroup and other collaborators turned their attention to an agent-based\nsimulation model called Avida (Lenski et al. 2003). In this\ncomputational model, self-replicating \u201cdigital organisms\u201d\ncompete for resources in the form of computer memory, and can\naccumulate mutations over time in their \u201cgenomes\u201d (strings\nof computer code). Lenski and colleagues are very clear that when they\nstudy Avida, just as when they study their E. coli in the\nflasks, the aim is to infer something about the evolving world at\nlarge: \u201cWhen we study this tractable system, we aim to shed\nlight on principles relevant to any evolving system\u201d (2003:\n139). Because Avida allows for open-ended exploration of evolutionary\ntrajectories via an algorithmic procedure, this way of modelling\nevolution turns out to be highly complementary to studying bacteria in\nthe laboratory.\n\nTo give an example: perhaps the most famous result from Lenski\u2019s\nlong-term evolution experiment is the origin of citrate utilization in\njust one of the twelve E. coli lineages (Blount et al.\n2008). Citrate is present\nin the bacterial growth medium and is a potential energy source, but\none that E. coli lack the ability to use aerobically (i.e.,\nin the presence of oxygen)\u2014or, at least they were unable to,\nuntil around 31,500 generations into the experiment when one strain\naccumulated the mutations relevant to growing on citrate. This new\ncapacity gave the population a relative advantage over\nnon-citrate-eating strains.\n\nTo work out how this had occurred, the researchers reconstructed the\nparticular evolutionary trajectory that led to this multi-step\ninnovation (Blount et al. 2012). They were able to do this\nstep-by-step reconstruction because of the tractability of the model\nsystem, and in particular because they had frozen regular time points\nin the evolutionary history of each bacterial lineage. Large bacterial\npopulations can be frozen and later revived; researchers can thus\nmaintain a \u201cfrozen fossil record\u201d (Lenski 2011) and\ncompare a current population\u2019s features (such as fitness or\nmorphology) to those of its ancestral population, or reconstruct steps\nin its evolutionary trajectory. In this case, frozen population\nsamples could be sequentially analyzed to infer the order of\nmutational steps. A very similar sort of reconstruction could be\ncarried out on the complex mutations occurring in the Avida simulation\n(Lenski et al. 2003). The researchers were able to rerun the computer\nmodel many times to understand every step along the way towards the\naccumulation of a complex mutation, in this case, a logic function\nmore complicated than any of the basic instructions in the digital\norganisms computer-code genomes. This allowed researchers to study the\naccumulation of mutations leading to complex novel traits in two\ncomplementary and comparable sorts of model systems.\n\nMany other small organisms have been used experimentally as living\nmodels of mathematical equations or simulations (e.g., mites,\nbeetles). But microbes are particularly tractable in that they are\neasy to maintain and propagate in a laboratory, especially compared to\nother classic model organisms like mice. This is partly because they\nare so small: huge populations of them can be kept in tiny spaces. It\nis also because some species do not need much looking after compared\nto other laboratory organisms; pop them into a flask of growth medium\n(a simple mix of a few chemicals) or smear them on an agar plate, and\ntheir populations will grow exponentially. Many laboratory cultured\nmicrobes have very short generation times compared to larger\norganisms. Some bacteria can produce tens of generations a day if not\nresource constrained, which allows for long-term evolutionary studies\nover reasonable human research timescales.\n\nBeyond these practical benefits, however, are epistemic advantages\nthat allow bacterial models to be compared very readily to\nmathematical and computational models. Population size has theoretical\nvirtues on top of the practical ones. Evolutionary theory predicts\nvery different outcomes for small versus large populations\n(Charlesworth 2002), and\nkey theoretical tools assume infinite populations (see the\n SEP entry on population genetics).\n The very large population sizes of most bacteria mean they are good\nproxies for these idealized equations. Microbial experimental systems\ncan not only serve as proxies for theoretical models, but also show\nwhen something is fundamentally wrong with the mathematical\nassumptions. In the case discussed above, Gause wanted to model the\nLotka-Volterra equations with a microbial analogue experiment. But the\nmathematical model assumes that both populations can rebound\ncontinuously from extremely low numbers, and that stochastic processes\ndo not affect these deterministic outcomes. In many actual\npopulations, the growth curves simply cannot rebound from very low\nvalues and the stable oscillations do not occur, just as Gause found.\nComputational simulations of the Lotka-Volterra equations similarly\nfind that extinction of predators or both predator and prey is\ninevitable unless additional resource limitations are introduced\n(Wilensky & Reisman 2006; Weisberg & Reisman 2008). The actual\ndetails of which models do better on what dimensions do not matter\nhere. The emphasis is on how modellers can shift back and forth from\nmathematics to computational simulations to microbial experiments\nbecause of basic structural similarities that are not overwhelmed by\norganismal complications (O\u2019Malley & Parke 2018).\n\nThe comparability of these very different media can be taken further,\nbecause of the capabilities discussed already for maintaining a\n\u201cfrozen fossil record\u201d by reviving ancestral populations\nand studying their evolutionary trajectories. This allows researchers\nto \u201cback up\u201d a population\u2019s evolutionary trajectory\nand \u201crerun\u201d it an arbitrary number of times from an\nearlier timepoint, by defrosting and reviving (repeatedly) a frozen\nancestral population sample (e.g., Travisano et al. 1995). This\nbacking up and re-running of population trajectories is very similar\nto the recursivity of algorithms in computer simulations. It also\nresonates with thought experiments such as Gould\u2019s (1989) famous\nidea about \u201creplaying the tape of life\u201d. While Gould\noriginally presented the thought experiment as a metaphor, and had in\nmind rewinding and replaying all of life on earth, long-term\nmicrobial evolution experiments show how at least a subset of\n\u201clife\u201ds tape\u2019 can actually be replayed (see Beatty\n2006 for discussion of the extent to which this sort of experimental\nwork fits Gould\u2019s ideas about his thought experiment).\n\nThought experiments such as replaying the tape of life have also been\nconsidered \u201cmental models\u201d (see\n SEP entry on thought experiments;\n Nersessian 2018), and\nphilosophers are very fond of constructing and manipulating such\nmodels to generate new insights. That microbial experimental models,\nwhich are very concrete, can potentially be compared to mental models,\nwhich are very abstract, might seem surprising at first glance. But if\ncomparability is central to modelling practice (O\u2019Malley &\nParke 2018), and if we recognize a range of model\nmedia\u2014including mental constructs\u2014then perhaps comparing\nabstract and idealized thought experiments with material models of\nunicellular life more often might be a fruitful philosophical\napproach. Now of course empirically inclined philosophers thinking\nabout cognition or the evolution of behavior might choose instead to\ncompare their mental models to models based on animals or plants. But\njust as Gause wanted the maximum reduction in extraneous complexity in\norder to compare basic mathematical structures with living population\nstructures, then so might philosophers who manipulate mental\nstructures want a stripped-down living model analogue. Whether or not\nphilosophers feel encouraged to carry out such comparisons is not the\nmain point of this section, however, which is primarily to note\nthat abstract modelling efforts with mathematics and algorithms (and\npotentially mental constructs) can effectively be compared with\nmicrobial model systems. Such comparability then raises a whole slew\nof additional questions for philosophical inquiry. One of the main\nquestions is about just how far such comparisons can be taken.\n",
