Persistent Criticisms and Future Research\n\n\nAlthough democracy is widely regarded as an ideal worth attaining,\ncritics of global democracy have been numerous and persistent (Miller\n1995; Dahl 1999; Moravcsik 2004). A variety of strong objections have\nbeen raised to the fundamental project of global democracy, as well as\nspecific criticisms about institutional proposals and methodology. It\nis not possible to undertake a survey of all criticisms in the\nliterature (and several core issues have already been discussed in the\nprevious sections). The final section, however, will outline two core\nissues that global democrats need to grapple with in current and\nfuture research. Both subsections relate to the issue of power.\n",
