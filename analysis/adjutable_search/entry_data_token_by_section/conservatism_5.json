    "main_text": "The Development of Conservative Thought || Use of the term \u201cconservative\u201d\n2.1 Use of the term \u201cconservative\u201d\n\nBurke\u2019s French disciples first coined the word\n\u201cconservative\u201d (French, \u201cconservateur\u201d); Burke\nhimself used \u201cconserve\u201d. To reiterate\n 1.2\n above, conservatism and revolutionary Jacobinism are inter-dependent\nconcepts that arose together; the concept predates its label. The\nEnglish Revolution of the 17th century adumbrates the polarity, in the\nconflict between Cavaliers and Roundheads. The Cavaliers were,\ncrudely, the precursors of the Tories who later became known as\nConservatives. The term \u201cTory\u201d dates from the Exclusion\nCrisis 1679-81, during the reign of Charles II. The parliamentary\nfaction that wanted to exclude Charles\u2019 Catholic brother James from\nthe succession were known as Whigs, and those who supported his right\nto the throne were Tories. \u201cTory\u201d is derived from the\nIrish Gaelic word t\u00f3raidhe, meaning a dispossessed Irish outlaw.\n\u201cTory\u201d was also used during the American War of\nIndependence, referring to colonists loyal to the British monarchy; in\nCanada, the term is still use to describe centre-right\nConservatives.\n\nIn 1830 the Quarterly Review commented that \u201cwhat is\ncalled the Tory might with more propriety be called the Conservative\nparty\u201d, and Canning and Peel adopted the label. (The Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary entry suggests that \u201cConservative\u201d\noriginally designated an opponent of reactionary \u201cTory\u201d\nviews.) \u201cLiberal\u201d began to be used for the Whigs, and by\n1840 Thomas Carlyle used \u201cconservatism\u201d to describe what\nhe regarded as opposition to progress. (\u201cTory\u201d survives,\nas a label for the British party; \u201cWhig\u201d does not.)\nMill\u2019s \u201cEssay on Bentham\u201d (1838) described Bentham\nas a \u201cProgressive\u201d, and Coleridge as a\n\u201cConservative\u201d. Other European languages borrowed\n\u201cconservative\u201d and \u201cconservatism\u201d from\nEnglish. Mostly it is the British, and their former Empire, that have\nparties labelled Conservative; countries with a strong republican\ntradition (France, U.S.A., Argentina) have never had mass-based,\nself-styled \u201cconservative\u201d parties. European parties of\nthe right are Christian Democrat, and in the U.S.A., Republican. However,\none should not conclude that conservatism is essentially a British\nview; all cultures have political sceptics who value experience. \n",
