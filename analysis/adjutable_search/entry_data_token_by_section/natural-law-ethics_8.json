    "main_text": "Theoretical Options for Natural Law Theorists || The catalog of basic goods\n2.3 The catalog of basic goods\n\nA developed natural law theory includes within it a catalog of the\nfundamental goods, the basic values upon which the principles of right\nare founded. Suppose that we follow at least the inclinationist line,\ntaking it to be faithful to the natural law idea that knowledge of the\nbasic goods is widely distributed. Our task then is to provide an\nexplicit account of those goods implicit knowledge of which is\nmanifested in human inclination toward certain ends. What are the\ngoods affirmation of which makes intelligible these inclinations?\n\nIt is clear from this way of putting the question that even if natural\nlaw theorists are right that this implicit knowledge is widely\ndistributed, it would be easy for natural law theorists to disagree in\ntheir catalogs of basic goods. For the task here is that of\nformulating propositionally, and in as illuminating a way as possible,\nwhat items need be affirmed as intrinsically good in order to make\nsense out of our inclinations. And there are, unsurprisingly,\ndisagreements in catalogs of basic goods. The goods that Aquinas\nmentions in his account include life, procreation, social life,\nknowledge, and rational conduct. Grisez 1983 includes\nself-integration, practical reasonableness, authenticity, justice and\nfriendship, religion, life and health, knowledge of truth,\nappreciation of beauty, and playful activities (pp. 121\u2013122).\nFinnis 1980 includes life, knowledge, aesthetic appreciation, play,\nfriendship, practical reasonableness, and religion (pp. 86\u201390).\nChappell 1995 includes friendship, aesthetic value, pleasure and the\navoidance of pain, physical and mental health and harmony, reason,\nrationality, and reasonableness, truth and the knowledge of it, the\nnatural world, people, fairness, and achievements (p. 43). Finnis 1996\naffirms a list much like Grisez 1983, but includes in it \u201cthe\nmarital good\u201d (p. 5). Murphy 2001 includes life, knowledge,\naesthetic experience, excellence in work and play, excellence in\nagency, inner peace, friendship and community, religion, and happiness\n(p. 96). Gomez-Lobo 2002 includes life, the family, friendship, work\nand play, experience of beauty, theoretical knowledge, and integrity\n(pp. 10\u201323). Crowe (2019) includes life, health, pleasure,\nfriendship, play, appreciation, understanding, meaning, and\nreasonableness (p. 35).\n\nAside from the inevitable differences in lists of goods produced by\nnatural law theorists, there are also more focused debates about the\ninclusion of particular alleged goods within the natural law\ntheorists\u2019 lists. Note, for example, that of the lists above,\nonly Chappell\u2019s includes pleasure and the absence of pain.\nWhatever else we say here, it seems that common sense is initially on\nChappell\u2019s side: what seems more obvious than that pleasure and\nthe avoidance of pain are basic reasons for action?\u00a0 The reasons\nfor rejecting pleasure and the absence of pain from the list of goods\nare various: some writers argue, following Aristotle, that pleasure is\nnot a good in abstraction from the activity in which pleasure is\ntaken; some that the absence of pain is not a completion or a\nfulfillment of human nature, and thus cannot be among the basic goods;\nsome that the avoidance of pain is simply an instance of some other\nbasic good, such as inner peace. What this debate illustrates is the\nextent to which the formulation of a catalog of goods is not a\nstraightforward matter. Everyone agrees that one who avoids touching a\nhot stove in part to avoid the awful pain has some reason to\navoid touching the stove. The difficulty is to bring together our\nvarious sources of knowledge about the good to formulate an account\nthat explains well precisely why it is that such an act is reasonable.\nThese sorts of debates reappear with respect to goods like life (is\nlife intrinsically or instrumentally good?\u00a0 is merely being alive\nintrinsically good, or is life only intrinsically good when one is\nenjoying a certain level of vitality?), religion (is harmony with God\nreally a human good?\u00a0 is it merely a kind of friendship?\u00a0\ndoes its status as a good depend on whether there is a being such as\nGod?), and what Finnis and Grisez now call the \u2018marital\ngood\u2019 (is the good of marriage simply an amalgam of various\nother goods, as friendship, procreation, rational agency, or is it\nreally a distinct, analytically separable value?). Thus\nEche\u00f1ique denies that life can be a basic good in the way that\nnatural law theorists typically take it to be (Eche\u00f1ique 2016);\nCuneo has rejected religion as a basic good (Cuneo 2005, pp.\n116\u2013118); and Macedo has argued against the marital good (Macedo\n1995).\n",
