    "main_text": "Health || Embedded Instrumentalism\n5.2 Embedded Instrumentalism\n\nGadamer\u2019s view is reminiscent of what Richman (2003) calls\n\u201cembedded instrumentalist\u201d theories, which claim that\nhealth is indexed to goals: how healthy you are depends on how well\nyou can fulfill your goals. Such theories are very popular. Nordenfelt\n(1995) considered two versions of this approach. One version defines\nthe goals relevant to health as needs, which are understood as having\na biological basis. Another view defines goals in terms of the\nambitions and desires of the individual. Nordenfelt (1995, 90) argues\nthat a healthy person is one who can satisfy her \u201cvital\ngoals\u201d, which are those that are necessary and sufficient for\nher to be minimally happy.\n\nEmbedded instrumentalist theories of health have an obvious appeal.\nOnce we argue that health involves judgments about how well a person\u2019s\nlife is going, we need a way to evaluate that, and an immediately\nattractive idea is that someone\u2019s life goes well if they can achieve\ntheir ambitions or satisfy their goals. An apparent difficulty,\nhowever, is that much the same terrain is covered by theories of\nwell-being, and while people think that being healthy is important to\ntheir well-being (Eid and Larsen 2007), they do not identify the two.\nRather, they think of health as a component of well-being or a\ncontributor to it.\n\nSome embedded instrumentalist theories, though, appear to be in danger\nof defining health in such a way that it is synonymous with\nwell-being. Richman (2003), for example, develops his view, (the\n\u201cRichman-Budson view\u201d) to deal with objections that\nNordenfelt raises against goal-based views, such as the worry that\nsomeone with very low ambitions will count as healthy just because she\nis easily satisfied. Richman (2003, 56\u201357) supposes that someone\nis healthy if she can strive for a consistent set of goals that would\nbe chosen by an idealized version of herself if she were fully aware\nof her \u201cobjectified subjective interest\u201d (p.45). That is,\nthey are the goals she would choose if she had complete knowledge of\nherself and her environment and perfect rationality.\n\nIn this case it seems that a theory of health is in danger of becoming\na general theory of well-being, and Richman does not discuss the\nrelationship between the two. A further complication is the\nrelationship between medical interventions designed to cure diseases,\nand other medical interventions which are \u201cenhancement\ntechnologies\u201d (Elliott 2003). The line between enhancement and\ntherapy is very hard to draw: Harris (2007, 21) for example, uses the\nexample of vaccination, which is both a therapeutic protection against\ninfection and an enhancement of our natural immune system. Perhaps,\ntoo, many of us would benefit from a boost to our powers of\nconcentration, or a lift in our mood, which pharmaceuticals might\nsupply. But neurological enhancements, unlike vaccines, can help us to\nmeet our goals without guarding against disease. Perhaps what is\nneeded is a weaker view of the relation between health and\ngoal-directedness, such as that offered by Whitbeck (1981, 620).\nWhitbeck defines health in terms of the psychophysiological capacities\nof an individual that support her \u201cgoals, projects and\naspirations in a wide variety of situations\u201d. This view loosens\nthe tight Richman-Budson connection between health and goal-directed\naction, and suggests a view on which we can see biological capacities\nas at the core of health in so far as they help people\u2019s lives to go\nbetter. So there seems to be a broad but not unanimous view that\nwhatever one thinks about the value-ladenness of health we need a\nthreefold distinction between disease, health (which may or may not be\npartly evaluative, and some properties of a person\u2019s life that enable\nus to evaluate how well it is going for them. Not all such properties\nare health problems \u2013 someone who is oppressed is not unhealthy\nsimply in virtue of being oppressed (though oppression can certainly\ncause health problems) \u2013 oppression itself can be distinguished\nfrom the health problems that may follow from the nature of oppression\n\n\nSchroeder (2013) has taken issue with the whole idea of defining health as a property or state of an individual. He argues in contrast\nthat \u201chealth\u201d is a fundamentally comparative term like\n\u201ctall\u201d. Two human beings can both be tall even if one is\ntaller than the other, whereas it makes no sense to think of two\nstraight lines, one of which is straighter than the other. Schroeder\nargues that if we see health as fundamentally comparative or relational \nwe can recast several conceptual, ethical and policy debates. For\nexample, instead of thinking in terms of non health-related\ndifferences among the healthy we could think in terms of gradations of\nhealth. Schroeder also thinks that his approach makes\nintergenerational or cross-temporal comparisons easier, since we can\nsay that a medieval serf was healthy in their time, but nonetheless\nless healthy than a modern person who is, by our standards,\nchronically ill. An approach like this might offer some traction on\nthe reference class problem outlined above.\n",
