Introduction\n\nIt is not uncommon for humans to find themselves with the intuition\nthat random, unplanned, unexplained accident just\ncouldn\u2019t produce the order, beauty, elegance, and\nseeming purpose that we experience in the natural world around us. As\nHume\u2019s interlocutor Cleanthes put it, we seem to see \u201cthe\nimage of mind reflected on us from innumerable objects\u201d in\nnature (Hume 1779 [1998], 35). And many people find themselves\nconvinced that no explanation for that mind-resonance which\nfails to acknowledge a causal role for intelligence, intent and\npurpose in nature can be seriously plausible.\n\nCosmological arguments often begin with the bare fact that there are\ncontingently existing things and end with conclusions concerning the\nexistence of a cause with the power to account for the\nexistence of those contingent things. Others reason from the\npremise that the universe has not always existed to a cause that\nbrought it into being. Teleological arguments (or arguments from\ndesign) by contrast begin with a much more specialized catalogue\nof properties and end with a conclusion concerning the existence of a\ndesigner with the intellectual properties (knowledge,\npurpose, understanding, foresight, wisdom, intention) necessary to\ndesign the things exhibiting the special properties in\nquestion. In broad outline, then, teleological arguments focus upon\nfinding and identifying various traces of the operation of a mind in\nnature\u2019s temporal and physical structures, behaviors and paths.\nOrder of some significant type is usually the starting point\nof design arguments.\n\nDesign-type arguments are largely unproblematic when based upon things\nnature clearly could not or would not produce (e.g.,\nmost human artifacts), or when the intelligent agency is itself\n\u2018natural\u2019 (human, alien, etc.). Identifying designed\ntraces of \u2018lost\u2019 human civilizations or even non-human\ncivilizations (via SETI) could in principle be uncontroversial.\nObjections to design inferences typically arise only when the posited\ndesigner is something more exotic or perhaps supernatural.\n\nBut despite the variety of spirited critical attacks they have\nelicited, design arguments have historically had and continue to have\nwidespread intuitive appeal\u2014indeed, it is sometimes claimed that\ndesign arguments are the most persuasive of all purely philosophical\ntheistic arguments. Note that while design arguments have\ntraditionally been employed to support theism over metaphysical\nnaturalism, some might also be relevant for panentheism, panpsychism,\nand other views involving irreducible teleology.\n",
