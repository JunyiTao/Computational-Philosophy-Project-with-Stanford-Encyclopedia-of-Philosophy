    "main_text": "Aesthetics || Beauty\n4.1 Beauty\n\nBeauty is at the center of Shaftesbury\u2019s aesthetics. Shaftesbury\ndiscusses the beauty of literature, music, and painting. He takes the\nprimary instances of physical beauty to be features of the natural\nworld. Shaftesbury\u2019s characters in The Moralists dismiss\nthe beauty of gardens, arguing for the superiority of naturalness or\nwildness over the artifice and \u201cformal Mockery of princely\nGardens\u201d (C 2.393\u20134). But Shaftesbury himself was a great\nlover of gardens, and the gardens he himself planned were more formal\nthan they were wild or natural. For fascinating discussions of\nShaftesbury\u2019s views of gardening and their influences, see\nLeatherbarrow (1984), Liu (2008), Fleming (2014), and Myers (2010 and\n2017).\n\nShaftesbury\u2019s conception of beauty has metaphysical and\nepistemological components. Metaphysically, beauty consists of\n\u201cUnity of Design\u201d (C 3.349). Anything that has\nmultiple parts that can be in unity with each other can be beautiful.\nAn artwork can be beautiful, a machine can be beautiful, a natural\nobject can be beautiful, nature as a whole can be beautiful, a human\ncharacter can be beautiful. Shaftesbury uses various words to describe\nthis property: \u201charmony,\u201d \u201cproportion,\u201d\n\u201cregularity,\u201d \u201corder,\u201d \u201cbalance,\u201d\n\u201csymmetry.\u201d His idea that this is what beauty consists of\nseems deeply indebted to Aristotelian and Stoic conceptions of the\nfine and the beautiful.\n\nEpistemologically, we discern beauty through experience of a positive\naffection. We experience a positive \u201cinternal Sensation\u201d\nwhen we hear musical harmonies, when we observe a proportionate\nbuilding, when we appreciate the balance of nature, when we witness\nfully integrated characters (C 2.285). \u201cNor can [one\u2019s\nmind] with-hold its Admiration and Extasy, its\nAversion and Scorn, any more in what relates to one than\nto the other of these Subjects\u201d (C 2.29). We have a\n\u201ctaste\u201d for unified wholes. We have a \u201cliking\u201d\nfor harmony and a \u201cdislike\u201d of its contrary. We have an\nemotional sensibility that\u2019s tuned to standards of order,\nregularity, and balance.\n\nA question for Shaftesbury is whether his metaphysical view of the\nproperty of beauty is conceptually prior to his epistemological view\nof our discernment of beauty, or vice versa. We might, in other words,\nask him: in a world in which we were built to like disharmonious\nthings, would we all be wrong about what is beautiful (metaphysics\nprior), or would disharmonious thing be in fact beautiful\n(epistemology prior)? Shaftesbury\u2019s texts may not provide a\nperfectly clear answer to this question, but there is certainly\nevidence that he would want to say that the metaphysics is prior. For\nhe wanted to be a \u201cRealist in Morality,\u201d where\nrealism involves \u201cimmutable\u201d and \u201ceternal\nMeasures\u201d of morality that are independent of any mind (C\n2.267; 2.36). Such mind-independent moral measures are necessary for\nShaftesbury\u2019s refutation of what he takes to be the pernicious\nsubjectivism of Hobbes and the despicable voluntarism of the\nCalvinists. And he explicitly equates the metaphysical status of moral\nbeauty with the beauty of objects. Here\u2019s a passage in which he\nmakes an emphatic statement that seems to affirm the mind-independence\nof beauty in general and of moral beauty in particular.\n\nHarmony is Harmony by Nature, let Men judg ever so ridiculously\nof Musick. So is Symmetry and Proportion founded still\nin Nature, let Mens Fancy prove ever so barbarous, or their\nFashions ever so Gothick in their Architecture, Sculpture, or\nwhatever other designing Art. \u2019Tis the same case, where\nLife and Manners are concern\u2019d. Virtue has the\nsame fix\u2019d Standard. The same Numbers, Harmony,\nand Proportion will have place in Morals; and are discoverable\nin the Charactersand Affections of Mankind; in which are\nlaid the just Foundations of an Art and Science, superior to every\nother of human Practice and Comprehension. (C 1.353)\n\nThe standards of beauty have an existence that is independent of human\nresponses, distinct from any \u201chuman Practice and\nComprehension.\u201d Even if we responded totally differently than we\nactually do, the same sounds would be beautifully harmonious, the same\nstructures would be beautifully symmetrical, and the same characters\nwould be beautifully integrated.\n\nBut there\u2019s a problem with this affirmation of the\nmind-independence of beauty. Shaftesbury relies on the idea that\nharmony will be harmony and symmetry will be symmetry regardless of\nhow humans respond to advance the idea that virtue will be virtue\nregardless of how humans respond. But this line of thought seems to\ninvolve an illicit slide between non-normative and normative\nunderstandings of the key terms. It may be reasonable to grant that\nthere are non-normative properties of harmony and symmetry that have a\nmind-independent existence\u2014that some sounds would be harmonious\nand some objects would be symmetrical regardless of whether there were\nany human minds, or how human minds responded to them. But to say\nthose sounds and objects are beautiful is to invoke a normative\ncomponent. It\u2019s to imply that the harmonious and the symmetrical\nare more valuable, are in some sense better than the dissonant\nand the lopsided. And Shaftesbury has given us no reason to accept\nthat harmony and symmetry would continue to be normatively superior\neven if human minds were constructed to respond negatively to them and\npositively to dissonance and lopsidedness. Shaftesbury might have\ngiven us reason to believe there would be a non-normative difference\nbetween unified and disunified objects regardless of how anyone\nresponds to them. But that\u2019s not what he needs to establish the\nmind-independence of beauty as something normative. What he needs is\nto show that unity would be more valuable, would be better than\ndisunity, even if our sensibility was constructed to respond\npositively to the disunified. The comparison with the non-normative\nproperties of harmony and symmetry doesn\u2019t help with that.\n",
