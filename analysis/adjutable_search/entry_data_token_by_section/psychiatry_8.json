We can know two kinds are causally\ndifferent even if we don\u2019t why they are different, because the\ndetails of the underlying causal structure evade us. Different types of\nplant may need to be put in the ground at different times, or in\ndifferent seasons, in order to maximize crop yield, for instance, and\nwe may be able to predict accurately that different patients will\nrespond to different drugs even if the basis for these differences\nremain unknown. But we assume that these differences rest on an\nunderlying causal structure. In psychiatry, differential\ndiagnosis follows a similar logic, but sceptics wonder if the degree of\nvariation makes the predictions too unreliable for this approach to\nreally work.\n\n\nAn explanation of this type places entities in kinds, thereby\ntracking the as yet unknown causal factors that regularly make the same\nkind of difference in patients of the same type. Rather than\nidentifying the causal factors, then, the natural history approach\ntracks the operation of hitherto unknown causes, by sorting patients\ninto kinds with a presumed common nature, based on the natural history\nof their conditions, or on other grounds that I have not talked about,\nlike differential responses to drugs.\n\n\nOur complete explanatory job is to explain the observed\ncausal-statistical network by identifying the mechanisms and other\nforces that give rise to it, viz. the causal structure of disorders.\nThe problem, of course, is the sheer variety of the phenomena, which\ndoes not give us the degree of epistemic security we get when we sort\nphenomena into kinds in other sciences. One way to make this variety\ntractable, suggested by the natural history approach, is to look for\nsome stable phenomena that do not vary. These are not likely to be\nfound at the level of diagnoses, because in many cases two people with\nthe same diagnosis will exhibit different behaviours and other symptoms\ndepending on their personal lives, cultural background, other mental\nillnesses, and so on. There is too much variety at the level of\ndiagnosis. So we must search for smaller units of explanation.\n\n\nWe can think of this first approach as zooming-in on one small\nportion of the overall network, looking for a unit that has enough\nstability across histories to allow for an explanation in which there\nare cause-effect regularities; if the underlying causal structure is\ntoo diverse, look for causal units that stably replicate across\npatients, explain them, and then put these well-understood parts\ntogether to explain individuals. Another advantage of this approach is\nthat it promises to treat patients as individuals rather than clumping\ntogether into kinds that they only approximately fit.\n\n\nThis zoom-in approach is exemplified by Bentall (2005) and\nSpaulding et al (2003). They both look for the smallest unit of\nreliable explanation or manipulation. Spaulding et al. argue from a\nclinical perspective for seeing patients as collections of\n\u201cproblems\u201d, with the problems in each case drawn from a\nrepertoire of clinically significant phenomena that different patients\nexemplify in different ways. Bentall argues that diagnoses like\ndepression or schizophrenia have proved helpless in the face of all the\nvariation that patients exhibit. He sees individual cases as\nmosaics made up of recurring symptoms like hallucinations, which can be\nseparated out and studied in isolation. According to this view, there\nis no such thing as schizophrenia. That\u2019s not because there is\nnothing wrong with schizophrenics, but because schizophrenia is not a\nnatural kind. The natural kinds of psychiatry are specific pathologies\nthat schizophrenics display in shifting conjunctions. These are\ndistinct psychotic phenomena that should be approached separately and\ntreated as distinct symptoms or complaints.\n\n\nBentall thinks \u201cwe should abandon psychiatric diagnoses\naltogether and instead try to understand and explain the actual\nexperiences and behaviours of psychotic people\u201d (2005, 141). But\nin fact he tries to relocate diagnosis at a more reliable level. For\nexample, Bentall (ch. 15) objects to the old model of inferring\nthought disorder on the basis of disordered speech.  His sees\ndisordered speech as a failure of communication, which is especially\nlikely when subjects are emotionally aroused. In Bentall\u2019s tentative\nmodel, initial deficits in working memory caused by emotional arousal\ninteract with other deficits in semantic memory, theory of mind and\nintrospective monitoring. The result is a failure to communicate and a\nlack of self-awareness of one\u2019s failure to communicate (which\ndistinguishes psychotic patients from normal subjects in the grip of\npowerful emotions who are struggling to get their ideas across). This\nis a stable phenomenon, in the sense that we can give the same causal\nstory in all cases of thought disorder, thus giving us a robust\naccount that transfers across patients. A general theory of\nschizophrenia would have too many qualifications and varieties to\ntransfer in this way.\n\n\nZooming-in faces two problems. First, where do we stop when looking\nfor smaller units? There is always the chance that some finer causal\ndiscrimination will uncover an even more stable structure.\n\n\nA proponent of zooming-in can always argue that the idea, as in any\nscience,\nis to develop the descriptive apparatus empirically in a way that\nultimately fits one\u2019s theory of the domain. Bentall and Spaulding\net al. are betting that any clustering\nof problems or symptoms will not line up neatly with the DSM\ncategories, and this is probably a good bet for any approach.\nBentall\u2019s chosen approach stresses the cognitive science of\npsychotic phenomena, whereas Spaulding et al. tend to look for\ncorrelations between clinically significant problems and a wider\nvariety of underlying phenomena; for Spaulding et al, the relevant\nsciences for identifying problems span many levels of analysis from the\nintra-cellular to the socio-cultural. Their examples include low levels\nof cortisol and learning deficits (127\u2013130).\n\n\nNonetheless, there will always be differences across patients in the\nphenomena when we zoom in. This is likely to be\nespecially problematic when these independently characterised\nlower-level phenomena start to combine in actual patients. Zooming in\nshould not, therefore, be thought as an alternative to idealization,\nsince any search for commonalities across patients will involve some\ndegree of idealization. The rival approach is another form of\nidealization, but zooms out to think in terms if idealized patients,\nrather than idealized problems.\n\n\nZooming out begins by accepting that mental illness almost always\ndepends on complex interactions between diverse lower-level phenomena\nand tries to deal with this variety by treating disease networks as\nidealizations that are more or less similar to actual histories. It is\na recurring theme in the history of psychiatry that the textbook\nexpression of a disorder can be realized in individuals in different\nways. Charcot (1887\u201388) distinguished archetypes, which are\nideal types of disorder, from formes frustes, which are the\nimperfect forms the ideal type manifests in individual subjects.\nBirnbaum\u2019s (1923) distinction between the pathogenic\nfeatures of a psychosis and its pathoplastic features is\nsimilar. The former define its essential structure, and the latter\nexpress the personal circumstances of the patient.\n\nMurphy (2006) argues that the variety in mental illness requires us to\nexplain psychiatric phenomena not by looking for stable regularities\nbut by constructing exemplars. Murphy sees the exemplar as an imaginary\npatient who has the ideal textbook form\u2014something like\nThagard\u2019s network, and the narrative it provides\u2014of a disorder,\nand only that disorder, although the textbook needs to thought of as a\nstatement of the final theory, and not any current work in\npsychiatry. As with zooming-in, the approach assumes that\ncommonalities across patients will be revealed by inquiry. The\nidea is to model all the causes that contribute to a natural history so\nas to explore how they work together in different contexts to produce\nthe various outcomes of interest, and then understand patients as\nidiosyncratic instances of the exemplar. When we explain a disease, we\nconstruct an exemplar and model it. But the causal structure that\nexplains the exemplar resembles real world patients to varying degrees.\nSo when we talk about individuals we explain their symptoms by\nidentifying processes in the patient and showing how they resemble some\npart of the model. Godfrey-Smith (2006), following Giere, suggests that\nthere may not be a helpful general treatment of these resemblance\nrelations. They are not formal relations but the sort of comparisons\nbetween imaginary and real states of affairs that we all perform\neffortlessly. If there is a general theory, then, it is likely to be\nfound not by philosophers but by cognitive scientists studying\nanalogical thought (e.g. Hummel and Holyoak 2005). And because it is\ninstrumental concerns that drive our search for explanations in\npsychiatry, as in medicine more generally, the clinically significant\nrelations between disease, model and patient are likely to be highly\ncontext-specific; they will be determined in part by whether they offer\nopportunities for successful therapeutic interventions, which depend\nnot just on how the world is arranged, but also on what our resources\nand opportunities are.\n\n\nThe exemplar lets us identify robust processes (Sterelny\n2003, 131\u20132, 207\u20138) that are repeatable or systematic in various\nways, rather than the actual processes that occur as a disorder unfolds\nin one person. But we do not stop there: the ultimate goal is causal\nunderstanding of a disease. We build a model to serve this end. It aims\nto represent the pathogenic process that accounts for the observed\nphenomena in the exemplar. To explain an actual history in a patient is\nto show how the processes unfolding in the patient resemble those that\nare assumed to occur in the exemplar. Exemplars provide an idealized\nform of the disorder that aims to identify the factors that remain\nconstant despite all the individual variation. Not every part of a\nmodel will apply to a given patient. Once we understand the resemblance\nrelations that exist between parts of the model and the exemplar, we\ncan try to manipulate the model so as to change or forestall selected\noutcomes in the real world.\n\n\nIn commenting on this approach, Mitchell (2009) points out that her\nown work (2003) contains an alternative approach to model-based\nexplanation in complex sciences. Her \u201cintegrative\npluralism\u201d aims to isolate individual causes and model them\nindividually, seeing how each makes a causal contribution on its own.\nTheorists then put together a collection of models of individual\nphenomena and try to integrate them by applying multiple models as\nseems necessary to explain a particular case. Mitchell\u2019s approach\nresembles the zoom-in in its search for decomposing, but it tries to\nisolate causes that can recombine\u2014such as genes or\ninterpersonal difficulties\u2014rather than searching for explanations of\nparticular clinical phenomena like thought disorder (see also Tabery\n2009). This is similar to the way Spaulding et al. seek the development\nand integration of causal models in the service of developing a\ncomprehensive clinical understanding of people and their problems.\n\n\nMitchell (2009, 131) suggests that we might need both her models and\nMurphy\u2019s as circumstances dictate. And there might be room for\nzoom-in models as well. There seems no reason why psychiatric research\ncould not aim to be pluralist about explanation and combine elements\ndrawn from all these explanatory styles as we learn more about what\nworks when we try to figure out mental illness.\n\nGhaemi (2003. ch 12) offers a different defense of zooming-out. He\nargues that current DSM diagnoses function as ideal types in\nWeber\u2019s sense. One way to understand Weber\u2019s idea is just\nas a forerunner of modelling, in which essential variables are isolated\nand inessential ones put aside. Ghaemi, though, locates it in a\ntradition of hermeneutic understanding that is most closely associated\nin psychiatry with Karl Jaspers (1997). This approach looks for\nmeaningful psychological connections between phenomena and is\ncontrasted with causal, scientific explanation. In Ghaemi\u2019s view\nthe DSM categories are designed to foster understanding of this type by\ndirecting clinical attention to aspects of the patient\u2019s life\nthat are relevant to the disorder at hand. He sees this as an\napplication of the methods of the humanities, rather than those of the\nsciences.\n\nOne argument that might be made against zooming-out is that it assumes\nthat mental disorders are categorical, rather than dimensional. The\nneo-Kraepelinian approach is often faulted for assuming that disorder\nis an all or nothing affair, whereas it might mark an extreme point on\na dimension that is present to a greater or lesser degree throughout\nthe population (Kendell 1975, McHugh and Slavney 1998, Poland et. al\n1994, Widiger and Sankis 2000). So schizophrenia might be seen either\nas condition that is present or not\u2014just as one either is of\nvoting age or not. But we might also see it as like having high blood\npressure\u2014marking a point on one or more dimensions where normal\npsychological traits become aggravated enough to constitute a\npopulation of clinical concern. Some psychiatrists have supported one\napproach or the other. Others, like Ghaemi (203), have argued that\nsome conditions, like the major psychoses and mood disorders, are\nprobably categorical, whereas other conditions, especially the\npersonality disorders, are dimensional.\n\nThis is clearly an empirical issue in the end, so if the zooming-out\napproach is committed to a categorical approach it is a cause for\nconcern. However, a zooming out approach could treat its models as end\npoints on a spectrum that usefully capture differences between\npopulations (Ghaemi, 199); this is compatible with looking for causal\nstories that explain the model. Furthermore, in so far as the\nzooming-in approach relies on idealizations too, it faces the same\nproblem. Bentall\u2019s approach, for instance, faces the issue of\nwhat degree of language difficulties counts as pathological, and\nSpaulding et al. need to find a way of distinguishing a clinical\nproblem from a phenomenon that is normal but unwelcome.\n",
