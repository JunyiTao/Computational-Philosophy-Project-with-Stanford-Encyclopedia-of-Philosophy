    "main_text": "The Nature of Free Will || Freedom to Do Otherwise vs. Sourcehood Accounts\n2.3 Freedom to Do Otherwise vs. Sourcehood Accounts\n\nSome have tried to avoid these lingering problems for compatibilists\nby arguing that the freedom to do otherwise is not required for free\nwill or moral responsibility. What matters for an agent\u2019s\nfreedom and responsibility, so it is argued, is the source of\nher action\u2014how her action was brought about. The most prominent\nstrategy for defending this move appeals to \u2018Frankfurt-style\ncases\u2019. In a ground-breaking article, Harry Frankfurt (1969)\npresented a series of thought experiments intended to show that it is\npossible that agents are morally responsible for their actions and yet\nthey lack the ability to do otherwise. While Frankfurt (1971) took\nthis to show that moral responsibility and free will come\napart\u2014free will requires the ability to do otherwise but moral\nresponsibility does not\u2014if we define \u2018free will\u2019 as\n\u2018the strongest control condition required for moral\nresponsibility\u2019 (cf. Wolf 1990, 3\u20134; Fischer 1994, 3; Mele\n2006, 17), then if Frankfurt-style cases show that moral\nresponsibility does not require the ability to do otherwise, then they\nalso show that free will does not require the ability to do otherwise.\nLet us consider this challenge in more detail.\n\nHere is a representative Frankfurt-style case:\n\nImagine, if you will, that Black is a quite nifty (and even generally\nnice) neurosurgeon. But in performing an operation on Jones to remove\na brain tumor, Black inserts a mechanism into Jones\u2019s brain\nwhich enables Black to monitor and control Jones\u2019s activities.\nJones, meanwhile, knows nothing of this. Black exercises this control\nthrough a sophisticated computer which he has programmed so that,\namong other things, it monitors Jones\u2019s voting behavior. If\nJones were to show any inclination to vote for Bush, then the\ncomputer, through the mechanism in Jones\u2019s brain, intervenes to\nensure that he actually decides to vote for Clinton and does so vote.\nBut if Jones decides on his own to vote for Clinton, the computer does\nnothing but continue to monitor\u2014without affecting\u2014the\ngoings-on in Jones\u2019s head. (Fischer 2006, 38)\n\n\nFischer goes on to suppose that Jones \u201cdecides to vote for\nClinton on his own\u201d, without any interference from Black, and\nmaintains that in such a case Jones is morally responsible for his\ndecision. Fischer draws two interrelated conclusions from this case.\nThe first, negative conclusion, is that the ability to do otherwise is\nnot necessary for moral responsibility. Jones is unable to refrain\nfrom deciding to vote for Clinton, and yet, so long as Jones decides\nto vote for Clinton on his own, his decision is free and one for which\nhe is morally responsible. The second, positive conclusion, is that\nfreedom and responsibility are functions of the actual\nsequence. What matters for an agent\u2019s freedom and moral\nresponsibility is not what might have happened, but how his action was\nactually brought about. What matters is not whether the agent had the\nability to do otherwise, but whether he was the source of his\nactions.\n\nThe success of Frankfurt-style cases is hotly contested. An early and\nfar-reaching criticism is due to David Widerker (1995), Carl Ginet\n(1996), and Robert Kane (1996, 142\u201343). According to this\ncriticism, proponents of Frankfurt-style cases face a dilemma: either\nthese cases assume that the connection between the indicator (in our\ncase, the absence of Jones\u2019s showing any inclination to decide\nto vote for Bush) and the agent\u2019s decision (here, Jones\u2019s\ndeciding to vote for Clinton) is deterministic or not. If the\nconnection is deterministic, then Frankfurt-style cases cannot be\nexpected to convince incompatibilists that the ability to do otherwise\nis not necessary for moral responsibility and/or free will, since\nJones\u2019s action will be deterministically brought about by\nfactors beyond his control, leading incompatibilists to conclude that\nJones is not morally responsible for his decision. But if the\nconnection is nondeterministic, then it is possible even in the\nabsence of showing any inclination to decide to vote for Bush, that\nJones decides to vote for Bush, and so he retains the ability to do\notherwise. Either way Frankfurt-style cases fail to show that Jones is\nboth morally responsible for his decision and yet is unable to do\notherwise.\n\nWhile some have argued that even Frankfurt-style cases that assume\ndeterminism are effective (see, e.g., Fischer 1999, 2010, 2013 and\nHaji and McKenna 2004 and for criticisms of this approach, see Goetz\n2005, Palmer 2005, 2014, Widerker and Goetz 2013, and Cohen 2017), the\nmajority of proponents of Frankfurt-style cases have attempted to\nrevise these cases so that they are explicitly nondeterministic and\nyet still show that the agent was morally responsible even though he\nlacked the ability to do otherwise\u2014or, at least that he lacked\nany ability to do otherwise that could be relevant to\ngrounding the agent\u2019s moral responsibility (see, e.g.,\nMele and Robb 1998, 2003, Pereboom 2001, 2014, McKenna 2003, Hunt\n2005, and for criticisms of these cases see Ginet 2002, Timpe 2006,\nWiderker 2006, Franklin 2011c, Moya 2011, Palmer 2011, 2013, Robinson\n2014, Capes 2016, Capes and Swenson 2017, and Elzein 2017).\n\nSupposing that Frankfurt-style cases are successful, what exactly do\nthey show? In our view, they show neither that free will and moral\nresponsibility do not require an ability to do otherwise in any\nsense nor that compatibilism is true. Frankfurt-style cases are\nof clear help to the compatibilists\u2019 position (though see Speak\n2007 for a dissenting opinion). The Consequence Argument raises a\npowerful challenge to the cogency of compatibilism. But if\nFrankfurt-style cases are successful, agents can act freely in the\nsense relevant to moral responsibility while lacking the ability to do\notherwise in the all-in sense. This allows compatibilists to concede\nthat the all-in ability to do otherwise is incompatible with\ndeterminism, and yet insist that it is irrelevant to the question of\nthe compatibility of determinism with moral responsibility (and\nperhaps even free will, depending on how we define this) (cf. Fischer\n1987, 1994. For a challenge to the move from not strictly necessary to\nirrelevant, see O\u2019Connor [2000, 20\u201322] and in reply,\nFischer [2006, 152\u201356].). But, of course, showing that an\nargument for the falsity of compatibilism is irrelevant does not show\nthat compatibilism is true. Indeed, many incompatibilists maintain\nthat Frankfurt-style cases are successful and defend incompatibilism\nnot via the Consequence Argument, but by way of arguments that attempt\nto show that agents in deterministic worlds cannot be the\n\u2018source\u2019 of their actions in the way that moral\nresponsibility requires (Stump 1999; Zagzebski 2000; Pereboom 2001,\n2014). Thus, if successful, Frankfurt-style cases would be at best the\nfirst step in defending compatibilism. The second step must offer an\nanalysis of the kind of sourcehood constitutive of free will that\nentails that free will is compatible with determinism (cf. Fischer\n1982).\n\nFurthermore, while proponents of Frankfurt-style cases often maintain\nthat these cases show that no ability to do otherwise is necessary for\nmoral responsibility (\u201cI have employed the Frankfurt-type\nexample to argue that this sense of control [i.e. the one required for\nmoral responsibility] need not involve any alternative\npossibilities\u201d [Fischer 2006, p. 40; emphasis ours]), we believe\nthat this conclusion overreaches. At best, Frankfurt-style cases show\nthat the ability to do otherwise in the all-in sense\u2014in\nthe sense defined by the Categorical\nAnalysis\u2014is not necessary for free will or moral\nresponsibility (cf. Franklin 2015). To appreciate this, let us assume\nthat in the above Frankfurt-style case Jones lacks the ability to do\notherwise in the all-in sense: there is no possible world in which we\nhold fixed the past and laws and yet Jones does otherwise, since all\nsuch worlds include Black and his preparations for preventing Jones\nfrom doing otherwise should Jones show any inclination. Even if this\nis all true, it should take only a little reflection to recognize that\nin this case Jones is able to do otherwise in certain weaker senses we\nmight attach to that phrase, and compatibilists in fact still think\nthat the ability to do otherwise in some such senses is necessary for\nfree will and moral responsibility. Consequently, even though\nFrankfurt-style cases have, as a matter of fact, moved many\ncompatibilists away from emphasizing ability to do otherwise to\nemphasizing sourcehood, we suggest that this move is best seen as a\nweakening of the ability-to-do-otherwise condition on moral\nresponsibility (but see Cyr 2017 and Kittle 2019 for criticisms of\nthis claim). (A potentially important exception to this claim is\nSartorio [2016], who appealing to some controversial ideas in the\nmetaphysics of causation appears to argue that no sense of the ability\nto do otherwise is necessary for control in the sense at stake for\nmoral responsibility, but instead what matters is whether the agent is\nthe cause of the action. We simply note that Sartorio\u2019s account\nof causation is a modal one [see especially Sartorio (2016,\n94\u201395, 132\u201337)] and thus it is far from clear that her\naccount of freedom and responsibility is really an exception.)\n",
