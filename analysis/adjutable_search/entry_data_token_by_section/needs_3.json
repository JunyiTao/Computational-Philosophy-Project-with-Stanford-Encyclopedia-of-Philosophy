    "main_text": "The normativity of need || The Significance of Relationships\n1.3 The Significance of Relationships\n\n\nWhere a caring relationship already exists, it is easy to identify the\nperson who has the moral obligation to meet another\u2019s needs, but\nthis raises the question whether needs as such can impose obligations\non those who have the means to satisfy them, or whether there must\nalready be a pre-existing relationship that explains why Alfred has an\nobligation to meet Betty\u2019s needs. Reader (2007, 72) defends\nthe view that \u2018need only constitutes an actual moral demand in\nthe context of a moral relationship\u2019. But she is obliged to\nstretch the idea of a moral relationship to deal with emergency\nsituations in which we intuitively think that rescuers are obliged to\ncome to the aid of complete strangers when they can do so at little\ncost. She does so by arguing that \u2018encounters\u2019, even very\nbrief ones, should count as a form of moral relationship (Reader 2007,\n 74\u20135). This, however, is implausible if it is intended to\ninclude cases such as those in which the person in need is unaware of\nthe presence of her saviour (for example because she is lying\nunconscious). The relationship between rescuer and victim here\nconsists simply in the former\u2019s physical capacity to carry out\nthe rescue at small cost: there is no person-to-person encounter\nbetween them prior to the rescue itself. So if we think that the\nrescuer in such cases does have an obligation to meet the needs of the\nvictim, then we must concede that human need alone can impose\nobligations in the absence of any further relationship between the two\nparties.\n\n\nA more nuanced view here would hold that it is only cases of extreme\nneed\u2014where life itself or serious bodily harm is at\nstake\u2014that can create such obligations between perfect\nstrangers. Where needs are less severe\u2014for example our\npsychological needs for love or moral support\u2014the obligation to\nmeet them falls only on those already connected to the person in\nneed. There is a parallel here to the debate in political morality\nabout the obligations of states to meet the needs of those inside and\noutside their borders, respectively. One view is that states are\nrequired to meet a quite extensive set of needs on the part of their\nown citizens (including, for example, needs for elaborate and\nexpensive forms of medical treatment), whereas their obligations to\noutsiders are more limited, and confined to cases such as famine or\nepidemic where lives are at risk. Others would challenge this\ndistinction, and argue that where needs are at stake states have a\nduty to be impartial, so that if state \\(S\\) is for some reason unable\nto meet the extensive needs of its own citizens, other states have a\n duty to step in and fill the gap (See \n global justice).\n",
