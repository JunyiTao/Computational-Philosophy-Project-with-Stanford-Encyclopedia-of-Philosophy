    "main_text": "Responses to Revisionism || Capacitarianism\n4. Conclusion\n\nWe have surveyed the five main positions regarding the EC on moral\nresponsibility. Intuitively, being morally responsible for some action\nor event requires awareness of certain things. As we have seen,\nhowever, there is great controversy about how to characterize the kind\nand content of the requisite awareness and, more fundamentally, about\nwhether awareness is actually required at all or not. A natural\nquestion is: how can we adjudicate the dispute among the different\npositions? The structure of the discussion suggests focusing on two\ncriteria (Wieland 2017a: 26): i) what position fits best with our\nintuitions about responsibility in different cases; ii) what position\nmerges best with the right conception of responsibility.\n\nConcerning the first criterion, many philosophers take it as a given\nthat theorizing about moral responsibility must be constrained by our\nordinary judgments and intuitions. So if an account of the EC clashes\nwith those judgments and intuitions, that gives us a pro\ntanto reason to reject it and, conversely, being able to\naccommodate them is a point in its favor (Sher 2009: 17; Clarke 2014:\n162; Schnall 2004: 308; FitzPatrick 2008: 610; Peels 2011: 578;\nMontmarquet 1999: 845; Arpaly 2015: 155). Other philosophers reject\nthis \u201cmethodological conservatism\u201d (Levy 2017) and take\nthe opposite line of giving priority to what they take to be the\ncorrect theory of responsibility, even if it implies that a good many\nof our ordinary judgments and intuitions are misguided (Rosen 2004:\n296; Zimmerman 2008: 205). In order to break the stalemate in the\ntheory vs. intuitions dispute, some have advanced an error theory of\nintuitions of blameworthiness in cases of unwitting wrongdoing which,\nif correct, would entail that failing to accommodate them\nshouldn\u2019t be hold against an account of the EC (Levy 2017;\nTalbert 2017b); while others have offered empirical evidence to\nsupport the very same intuitions (Murray et al. 2019). Yet\nother philosophers have presented empirical evidence concerning\nordinary intuitions of praise-/blameworthiness in cases of moral\nignorance that appears to support the quality-of-will theorists\u2019\nview that moral knowledge isn\u2019t required for either (Faraci\n& Shoemaker 2014). Thus, one way of settling the debate on the EC\nis to pursue this discussion on the preeminence, reliability, and\ncontent of ordinary intuitions about responsibility.\n\nConcerning the second criterion, it was noted at the end of\n section 3.3\n that the disagreement between quality-of-will theorists and the rest\nis partially grounded on competing conceptions of responsibility, and\nthis suggests that settling the debate on the EC partly depends on how\nthis broader dispute is resolved. Some philosophers think that it can\nbe shown that one conception is the only correct one (Levy 2005; A.\nSmith 2012), but the consensus seems to be that the different\nconceptions are all valid, since each of them captures different\naspects of our responsibility practices (Watson 1996; Shoemaker 2011;\nZimmerman 2015). If the latter view is correct, it\u2019s entirely\npossible that certain epistemic requirements apply to some types of\nresponsibility but not to others (Mason 2015; Zimmerman 2017) and,\nconsequently, it might well be the case that there are different EC\ndepending on the type of responsibility we focus on.\n",
