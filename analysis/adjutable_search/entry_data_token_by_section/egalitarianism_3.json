    "main_text": "Equality of Condition: Equality of What? || Lockean Rights\n3.1 Lockean Rights\n\n\nThe Lockean rights approach is so named because an early prominent\nexponent of the doctrine was John Locke (Locke 1690). It might just as\nwell be viewed as a rejection of egalitarianism rather than as a\nversion of it. Contemporary Lockeans are also known as libertarians\n(see Nozick 1974).\n\n\nThe Lockean view is that every person has equal basic moral\nrights\u2014natural rights. Natural rights are rights that one has\nindependently of institutional arrangements, people's subjective\nopinions, and cultural understandings. A person's natural rights give\nher a set of claims against all other persons that each person\nabsolutely must respect. Our understanding of a particular rights claim\nor type or rights claim increases if we can determine whether or not it\nis forfeitable, waivable by the bearer, and transferable.\n\n\nThe traditional content of Lockean rights is roughly as follows:\nEach person has the right to do whatever she chooses with whatever she\nlegitimately owns so long as she does not violate the rights of others\nnot to be harmed in certain ways\u2014by force, fraud, coercion,\ntheft, or infliction of damage on person or property. Each person has\nthe right not to be harmed by others in the mentioned ways, unless she\nvoluntarily waives any of her rights or voluntarily transfers them to\nanother or forfeits them by misconduct. Also, each adult person is the\nfull rightful owner of herself and each child person has the right to\nbe nurtured to adult status by those responsible for her creation. It\nis generally supposed in the Lockean tradition that starting from the\npremise of self-ownership, under actual conditions on earth one can\nvalidly derive strong rights of private appropriation and ownership of\nland and moveable parts of the earth (Nozick, 1974).\n\n\nProperty ownership of a thing comprises a bundle of rights, the\ncentral ones being the right to exclude others from the use of the\nthing and to control its use oneself. If I own my body, I can exclude\nothers from using it, and I have the right to decide its movements and\ncontrol what may be done to it. The Lockean supposes that in a world in\nwhich self-owning persons confront unowned material resources, moveable\nand immoveable parts of the Earth, all persons initially have an equal\nright to use the resources, taking turns if there is crowding. The\nLockean supposes this free use regime is provisional. Any individual is\npermitted to claim any part of the Earth as her private property\nprovided her doing so leaves \u201cenough and as good\u201d for\nothers. Nozick interprets this Lockean Proviso as follows: One's\nappropriation and continued holding of a part of the Earth as\none's private property is morally permissible provided that all\npersons affected by this claim of ownership are rendered no worse off\nby it than they would have been if instead the thing had remained under\nfree use (Nozick 1974, chapter 7; compare Simmons 1992, chapter 5). (A\ndifferent account will need to be given for intellectual property,\nproperty rights in ideas.)\n\n\nLockean rights do not single out a state of affairs, that in which\neveryone's rights are fully respected, and hold that all people are\nobligated to act in whatever ways are needed to bring about this state\nof affairs. Each person's right generates a duty to respect that right\non the part of every other person. Rights are constraints on what each\nindividual may do, and do not set goals that all are together obligated\nto fulfill (Nozick 1974, chapter 3).\n\n\nA more egalitarian variant of Lockean rights doctrine combines the\nright of self-ownership with skepticism about the Lockean account of\nthe moral basis of private ownership rights. Instead the left-wing\nLockean asserts that each person is the full rightful owner of herself\nand each adult person has a right to a per capita share of ownership of\nthe unimproved land and resources of the Earth. In short, this version\nof Lockeanism combines robust self-ownership with an egalitarian\naccount of world ownership. There are several variants to this\ndoctrine. Critics explore whether or not the doctrine is normatively\nstable: Do any plausible grounds there might be for denying Lockean\nprivate ownership of the world also generate grounds for denying\nindividual self-ownership? Do any grounds there might be for insisting\non individual self-ownership also generate reasons to insist on Lockean\nprivate ownership of the world? (See Steiner 1994, G. Cohen 1995,\nVallentyne and Steiner 2000a and 2000b, and Van Parijs 1995).\n\n\nThe nature of the dispute between the right-wing and left-wing\nLockeans emerges into view when we consider justice across generations.\nSuppose at one time the Earth is unowned and persons alive then\nappropriate all valuable land. On the next day, new people are born.\nWhat natural rights to land do they have? The left-libertarian holds\nthat the doctrine of ownership must provide for fair treatment of each\nsuccessive generation, and this requires that each new person has a\nright to an equal share of the value of unimproved resources or to some\nsimilar entitlement. The right-libertarian holds that the Lockean\nProviso fully accommodates the legitimate claims of new persons. On\nthis view, there is no fundamental right to an equal share in any\nsense. Luck plays a legitimate role in the operation of a natural\nrights regime. Granted, it is bad luck for me if I am born uncharming\nand lacking in good lucks and others are not voluntarily willing to\nenter into romance or friendship with me, but my distressed condition\ndoes not tend to show that my rights have been violated. And granted,\nit is bad luck for me if I come late on the scene and those who came\nfirst happen to be far better off in material wealth prospects than I,\nbut the fact that there are unequal prospects does not tend to show\nthat my rights have been violated. Provided the Lockean proviso is\ncontinuously satisfied and the appropriations by others leave me no\nworse off than I would have been under continued free use, my being\nworse off than others gives me no moral complaint against their\nproperty holdings.\n",
