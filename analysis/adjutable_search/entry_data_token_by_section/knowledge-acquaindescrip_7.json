Fallible Noninferentially Justified Beliefs\n\nAn acquaintance theory of justification that requires acquaintance\nwith a proposition\u2019s truth maker in order for the subject to be\njustified in believing the proposition may seem to require too much.\nThe requirement rules out the possibility of false\nnoninferentially justified belief, and the problem is that there seem\nto be plausible examples of such beliefs. Suppose that I am\nexperiencing what seems to be a marginal or border-line case of pain,\nand that I believe it is an experience of pain. But suppose that, as\nit turns out, my belief is false; the experience is not a pain but,\nsay, a painless itch. Prima facie, it is plausible that the\nbelief has some degree (perhaps not very much) of justification, the\nsame or very close to the degree of justification I might have in the\n\u201cgood\u201d case in which I correctly believe that I\nam experiencing pain on the basis of an experience of marginal pain.\nOther cases might involve mistaking hot and cold, mistaking shades of\nphenomenal color, mistaking the number of speckles in a region of\none\u2019s visual field, and mistaking the content of one\u2019s own\nthoughts. Moreover, even when we restrict our attention to\ntrue noninferentially justified beliefs, it seems plausible\nthat the degree of justification can vary, and we need some way of\naccounting for this. Suppose, for example, that I really am\nexperiencing a marginal case of pain. It is plausible to think that my\nbelief that I am experiencing pain, while true, is not as justified as\nthe belief would be if I were in searing pain. \n\nMcGrew (1995, 1999) argues that a kind of certainty or infallibility\n(in his terms, \u201cincorrigibility\u201d) is a necessary feature\nof empirical foundational beliefs: a belief that P is\nempirically foundational only if being justified in believing that\nP guarantees its truth. He defends the view that such\nfoundations are available and that they are adequate to yield\nknowledge of the external world. Other classical foundationalists want\nto allow for the possibility of false foundational beliefs.\n(See Fumerton 1995: 77; BonJour 2003: 73\u201374; and Fales 1996:\n174\u201380. For a critique of acquaintance theorists\u2019 attempts\nto accommodate fallibility at the foundations, see Huemer 2007, Poston\n2010, and Tucker 2016. For replies to some of these critiques, see\nFumerton 2010 and 2016, Hasan 2013, and Stoutenburg (forthcoming).\nStoutenburg nevertheless motivates infalliblism, and provides an\naccount of how propositions that moderate foundationalists regard as\nbasic derive their justification from infallibly known\npropositions.)\n\nIntuitively, we may want to allow that one be justified to some degree\nif the fact with which one is actually acquainted corresponds to a\nproposition that is very similar to the proposition believed (Fumerton\n1995: 77). This might suggest the following principle: \n\nIf one is directly aware of x\u2019s being F, and\nF is sufficiently similar to G, then one thereby has at\nleast some defeasible justification for believing that x is\nG. \n\n\nOne apparent problem with this suggestion is that the satisfaction of\nthe antecedent does not seem to give the subject a reason to think the\nbelief is true. The problem is clear if we assume, as acquaintance\ntheorists generally do, that a belief can be justified for a subject\nonly if the proposition believed is made probable by the\nsubject\u2019s evidence, or by that with which the subject is\nacquainted. The mere fact that I experience one of these shades fails\nto make probable, indeed, rules out, that I experience the other, and\nso gives me no justification for believing that I experience the\nother. Here\u2019s a second attempt:\n\nIf one is directly aware of x\u2019s being F, but\nit seems to oneself that x is G or one is inclined to\nbelieve that x is G, then one thereby has at least some\ndefeasible justification for believing that x is G.\n\n\nThe problem with this suggestion is that acquaintance or direct\nawareness doesn\u2019t seem to be doing the crucial epistemic work.\nIf the principle is true, why not hold some version of\n\u201cphenomenal conservativism\u201d in epistemology, the position\nthat a propositional awareness\u2014a seeming that x is\nG or an inclination to believe that x is\nG\u2014is a source of defeasible justification for believing\nthat x is G? If so, then the acquaintance or direct\nawareness requirement should be dropped from (2) and there would still\nbe the justification. Here is perhaps a more promising strategy:\n\nIf one is directly aware of x\u2019s being F, and\nx\u2019s being F makes it probable for one that it is\nG, then one thereby has at least some defeasible justification\nfor believing that x is G. \n\n\nWe get different versions of the acquaintance approach to fallible\nbeliefs depending on what is required for something to \u201cmake\nprobable for one\u201d. Acquaintance theorists with strong\ninternalist inclinations are likely to insist that awareness of the\nfact that p cannot justify one in believing that p\nunless the subject is in some way also aware of the fact\u2019s\nmaking it probable that p.\n\nReflection on some examples suggests the following problem with this\nprinciple. An experience\u2019s being a mere itch does not make it\nprobable that it is a pain, for its being a mere itch rules out its\nbeing a pain; and an experience\u2019s being indeterminately either\nan itch or a pain does not make it probable that it is a pain, for it\nmight just as probably be an itch. Or suppose that I am directly aware\nof a phenomenally red patch in my visual field, and on the basis of\nthis I form the false belief that it is, say, pink; or that I am\ndirectly aware of a determinate shade red1, but I form the\nfalse belief that the patch is red2. Again, principle (3)\ndoes not apply: something\u2019s being red cannot make it probable\nthat it is pink, for there are many other shades of red;\nsomething\u2019s being red1 cannot make it probable that\nit is red2, for being one determinate shade rules out being\nthe other. (See Huemer 2007 for an argument against (2) and (3) along\nthese lines, though one that employs some different examples.)\n\nThe problem, however, might not be with principle (3) itself but with\nthe sorts of features focused on (see Hasan 2013: section 3). There\nmay be other features involved in such apparent cases of fallible\nfoundational justification that do make probable the proposition\nbelieved. For example, consider the following principle, which is a\nspecific version of (3): \n\nIf one is directly aware of some feature\u2019s seeming to be\nG (or of one\u2019s being inclined to believe that it is\nG), and its seeming to be G makes it probable for one\nthat it is G, then one thereby has at least some defeasible\njustification for believing that it is G. \n\n\nTucker (2016) presents a dilemma for this proposal: Either the\nrelevant making probable relation is contingent, or it is necessary.\nIf it is contingent, then the justification will be inferential, and\nso the principle can\u2019t account for misleading noninferential\njustification. If it is necessary, then (like (2)), the principle has\ntoo much in common with phenomenal conservatism to be attractive from\nthe point of view of classical foundationalism. A plausible reply\nwould grasp the second horn: Unlike (2), this does not threaten to\ncollapse to conservatism, since it still requires acquaintance with\nsomething epistemically relevant to the target\nproposition\u2014acquaintance with a probability maker (and perhaps\nalso, for those with strong internalist inclinations, acquaintance\nwith the relation of making probable). If the view still has something\nin common with phenomenal conservatism, that might be a point in its\nfavor: it can help capture what the phenomenal conservatism seems to\nget right without accepting it.\n\nMoser (1989) seems to accept a view along these lines, though he would\nput the fundamental principle in explanatory terms, roughly as\nfollows:\n\nIf one is directly aware of x\u2019s being F, and\ny\u2019s being G is the best explanation for one of\nx\u2019s being F, then one thereby has at least some\ndefeasible justification for believing that y is G.\n\n\nSo, for example, if one is directly aware of the appearance of a blue\nbook, and such an appearance is best explained for one by the presence\nof an actual blue book, then one has some justification for believing\nthat a blue book is present. For Moser, physical object\nappearances may be given even though physical objects cannot,\nand these appearances may justify beliefs about physical objects\nwithout requiring beliefs about appearances. Though Moser does not\ndiscuss this explicitly, perhaps beliefs regarding our own experiences\ncan be justified in a similar way. If an appearance of pain can be\ngiven to me despite the fact that I am not in pain, and the appearance\nmakes probable or is best explained by the fact that I am actually\nexperiencing pain, then perhaps I have some justification for\nbelieving that I am in pain. Moser thus aims to defend a form of\nfoundationalism that is classical in its commitment to acquaintance or\nthe given, and yet \u201cmoderate\u201d not only in holding that\nsome noninferentially justified beliefs can be false, but also that\nsome external world beliefs can be noninferentially justified. A great\ndeal depends, of course, on whether a plausible account of these\nseemings or appearances can be given, and whether a strong enough case\ncan be made for the claim that the truth of the relevant propositions\ndo best explain the appearances (see Moser 1989: 158\u2013165, for a\ndefense of the latter for external-world beliefs). \n\nOthers who accept something along the lines of (3) or (4) seem to\nfocus on different features. According to Fales (1996: 175), while\nsomething\u2019s being given to one is not a matter of degree, the\n\u201ctransparency\u201d of the given is a matter of degree, and can\nitself be given. When one is thinking that some given experience or\nitem x is G, and one is directly aware of the uncertain\nor not-fully-transparent character of one\u2019s awareness, this can\nmake it merely probable for one that x is G. Fumerton\n(2016: 242) appeals to the controversial idea that correspondence can\ncome in degrees. For example, one can be aware of a shade of color\nthat is closer to the orange part of the color continuum but still\ncorresponds relatively well to the thought that it is red; as the\ncorrespondence gets weaker, the justification one has for the belief\nalso gets weaker.\n\nAccommodating fallible foundations complicates some aspects of the\ntraditional view introduced above. First, it no longer seems that\nRussell and Price\u2019s criterion that is reminiscent of the method\nof doubt is a very good method for determining what one is acquainted\nwith, for there will be some objects of acquaintance that are\nsusceptible to some degree of doubt. However, the method of doubt\nmight remain useful as a guide to the sort of thing with\nwhich one can be acquainted: for any physical object, I can conceive\nof a case in which any justification I have for believing that it\nexists is just as it is now, and yet there is no such object, and\nnothing remotely like it, in my vicinity. Second, we said above that\nnoninferential knowledge is secured by acquaintance with truth makers,\nwhile inferential knowledge is secured by acquaintance with logical\nand probabilistic connections between the propositions known and what\none infers from those propositions. One natural way for the\nacquaintance theorist to accommodate fallible foundations is to say\nthat p is noninferentially justified for one only if one is\ndirectly aware of some fact that either makes true or\nmakes probable for one that p; if the subject\u2019s\njustification for believing that p depends on one\u2019s\njustification for some other proposition(s) then the\njustification is inferential.\n\nThose who do find it plausible that they can be directly aware of\nrelations of correspondence between propositions and facts, and who\naccept some internalist requirement to the effect that one must be\naware of the relevance of some fact to the truth of a proposition in\norder for that proposition to be justified for one, may be inclined to\ngo a bit further and accept the possibility of acquaintance with other\nlogical or probabilistic relations between propositional and\nnonpropositional items. As we saw above in discussing inferential\nknowledge, some acquaintance theorists already accept that we can have\nacquaintance with entailment relations and, more controversially,\nepistemic probability relations between propositions. If we can be\naware of similar relations, at the foundational level, between some\npropositions and facts with which we are acquainted, this might\nsignificantly extend the sorts of foundational beliefs satisfying\nstrong internalist requirements. To give just a few simple examples,\nsuppose that I am directly aware of a red triangle in my visual field,\nand also aware of a relation of logical exclusion or incompatibility\n(or, if you like, non-correspondence) between the figure\u2019s being\na red triangle and the proposition that it is green, that it is a\ncircle, or that it has five sides. If acquaintance with correspondence\nis a source of noninferential justification, then perhaps acquaintance\nwith these relations of incompatibility can be a source of\nnoninferential justification for disbelieving these propositions, or\nfor believing their negations\u2014believing that the figure is not\ngreen, that it is not a circle, and that it is not five-sided\nrespectively. According to Moser (1989), we can also be directly aware\nof probabilistic or explanatory relations between propositions and\nnonpropositional items\u2014e.g., between the proposition that there\nis a blue book here, and the given appearance of a blue book (though,\nas already mentioned in\n section 3.1,\n he seems to take this as a requirement for doxastic as opposed to\npropositional justification).\n",
