    "main_text": "\n\nOverarching surveys of the history of philosophy often leave the\nimpression that philosophical skepticism\u2014roughly, the position\nthat nothing can be known\u2014had many adherents in the Ancient and\nHellenistic Periods, disappeared completely as a topic of intellectual\ninterest during the Middle Ages, and returned as a viable position in\nthe Renaissance and Early Modern Periods.\n\nAs a survey, this is quite understandable, since no thinker from the\nMiddle Ages professed an active allegiance to a systematic\nphilosophical skepticism. But a closer examination of Medieval\nPhilosophy shows that despite skepticism\u2019s disappearance as an\novert philosophical movement, it continued to swirl in the thoughts of\nmany of the best philosophers of the period. A very few, including\nmost prominently Augustine and Al-Ghazali, claimed to have been\nsystematic skeptics at some points in their pasts. Many others held\nskeptical views about localized issues such as one\u2019s ability to\nknow an efficient cause. And even more discussed and attempted to\nrefute commonplace skeptical arguments in defense of their own,\nanti-skeptical positions.\n\nChronologically speaking, skeptical issues were most prominently\nconsidered in works from both the leading and tail ends of the Middle\nAges. Augustine\u2019s 4th and 5th century attacks against the\nAcademic Skeptics mark the beginning of such discussions, and a\nsmattering of treatments of skeptical issues appears periodically\nthroughout the next 800 years. From the late 13th century onwards,\nhowever, skeptical issues began to exert a dominant and wide influence\non epistemological discussions, as seen in the works of such important\nfigures as Henry of Ghent, John Duns Scotus, William of Ockham, Peter\nAuriol, John Buridan, and Nicholas of Autrecourt.\n\nThough medieval discussions of skepticism are often found buried\nwithin larger, formulaic discussions of theological topics, these\ntreatments had influence beyond the academic circles within which they\nwere originally created and considered. Among Early Modern\nphilosophers, Descartes in particular owes a debt to these earlier\naccounts of skepticism: versions of both his cogito and Evil\nDemon arguments may be found in the works of medieval\nphilosophers.\n\nIn what follows we will briefly examine the relevant views of a few\nrepresentative figures from each tradition and era. Though none claims\nto be inclusive of the entire Middle Ages, the best scholarly\noverviews of important aspects of the medieval epistemological\ntradition are Tachau (1988), Pasnau (1997), Perler (2006), and\nLagerlund (2010a).\n",
