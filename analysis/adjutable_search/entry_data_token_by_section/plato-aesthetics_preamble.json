    "main_text": "\n\nIf aesthetics is the philosophical inquiry into art and beauty (or\n\u201caesthetic value\u201d), the striking feature of Plato\u2019s\ndialogues is that he devotes as much time as he does to both topics\nand yet treats them oppositely. Art, mostly as represented by poetry,\nis closer to a greatest danger than any other phenomenon Plato speaks\nof, while beauty is close to a greatest good. Can there be such a\nthing as \u201cPlato\u2019s aesthetics\u201d that contains both\npositions?\n\nTo the literal-minded the very phrase \u201cPlato\u2019s\naesthetics\u201d refers to an anachronism, given that this area of\nphilosophy only came to be identified in the last few centuries. But\neven those who take aesthetics more broadly and permit the term find\nsomething exploratory in Plato\u2019s treatments of art and\nbeauty. He might be best described as seeking to discover the\nvocabulary and issues of aesthetics. For this reason Plato\u2019s\nreaders will not come upon a single aesthetic theory in the\ndialogues. For the same reason they are uniquely situated to watch\ncore concepts of aesthetics being defined: beauty, imitation,\ninspiration.\n\nThere is something more, something important about Plato, to be said\nabout the label \u201caesthetics.\u201d One normally speaks of\naesthetics or a philosophy of art when the theory covers more than a\nsingle art form. For understandable reasons the Platonic dialogues\nfocus on poetry, and with special energy on dramatic poetry. Tragedy\nand comedy were culturally dominant art forms during Socrates\u2019\nlifetime and much of Plato\u2019s. Innovative, memorable, and now long\nenduring, Athenian drama invited scrutiny. But tellingly, when the\ndialogues comment on poetry they also look at it in tandem with the\nvisual arts \u2013 not capriciously either, but in keeping with an\nancient Greek tradition of comparing art forms \u2013 and in this\nmovement toward an overarching theory they deserve to be described as\npracticing the philosophy of art.\n\nJames Porter has recently argued that analogizing between art forms\ncharacterized a whole culture of sensualist aesthetic thinking before\nPlato and hence the early appearance of a general idea\n\u201cart.\u201d Poetry commented on architecture, drama on rhetoric\n(Porter 2010, 188). We may add that in another fashion tragedy\ncompared itself to sculpture (Pappas 2012b, 325). Some of these\ninterpretations of aesthetic analysis are controversial; but there is\nno doubt that the Homeric \u201cshield of Achilles\u201d passage\n(Iliad 18.479\u2013609) implies a parallel between the\nshield\u2019s presentation of war and peace and the treatment of those same\nsubjects in Homer. What Hephaestus depicts on the shield, Homer\ndepicts in his epics (Cunningham 2007, Francis 2009).\n\nThe poet Simonides makes the analogy explicit. \u201cPainting is\nsilent poetry and poetry is painting that speaks\u201d (Plutarch\nThe Glory of the Athenians 3.1, 346f-347a). Although poetry\ncasts itself as the standard that painting fails to achieve,\npossessing as it does the voice that painting lacks, still some common\nelement unites the different forms.\n\nPlato\u2019s explication of poetic mim\u00easis by means of the\nmim\u00easis in painting (see below on Republic Book\n10) belongs in this analogizing tradition, as Aristotle\u2019s account of\nmim\u00easis will after him (Poetics Chapter 4\n1448b4\u201319; Halliwell 2002, 178). On both theories, painting and\npoetry belong together as fellow species within a larger artistic\ngenus.\n\nAt the same time, Plato appears to consider painting on its own terms,\nnot merely as illustrative of a process also found in poetry. Many\npassages speak in approving terms of painting and sculpture, or\nrecognize the skill involved in making them as a techn\u00ea\n\u201cprofession, craft\u201d (Ion 532e-533a; Gorgias\n430c, 448b, 453c-d, 503e; Protagoras 318b-c; see Demand 1975,\nHalliwell 2002, 37\u201343). Even the famously anti-poetic Republic\ncontains positive references to paintings and drawings. Sometimes\nthese are metaphors for acts of imagination and political reform\n(472d, 500e-501c), sometimes literal images whose attractiveness helps\nto form a young ruler\u2019s character (400d-401a) \u2013 in any case\nvisual arts appreciated on their own terms and for their own sake.\n\nWhen the Republic treats painting and poetry together, in other\nwords, it does so with a clear independent sense of visual depiction.\nIt aims at developing a philosophy of art.\n\nThe subject calls for care. If perennially footnoted by later\nphilosophers Plato has also been perennially thumbnailed.\nClich\u00e9s accompany his name. It is worth going slowly through\nthe main topics of Plato\u2019s aesthetics\u2014not in the search\nfor some surprising theory unlike anything that has been said, but so\nthat background shading and details may emerge, for a result that\nperhaps resembles the commonplaces about his thought as a human face\nresembles the cartoon reduction of it.\n\nIn what follows, citations to passages in Plato use \u201cStephanus\npages,\u201d based on a sixteenth-century edition of Plato\u2019s\nworks. The page numbers in that edition, together with the letters\na\u2013e, have become standard. Almost every translation of Plato\nincludes the Stephanus page numbers and letters in the margins, or at\nthe top of the page. Thus, \u201cSymposium 204b\u201d\nrefers to the same brief passage in every edition and every\ntranslation of Plato.\n",
