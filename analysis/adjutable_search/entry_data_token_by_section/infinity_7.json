For any natural number\n\\(n\\), \\(n+1\\)\u2014the successor of \\(n\\)\u2014is also a\nnatural number. The natural numbers\u2014\\(1, 2, 3, \\dots\\)\u2014are\nclosed under addition: if \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) are natural numbers,\nthen so is \\(n_1+n_2\\). And they are closed under multiplication: if\n\\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) are natural numbers, then so is \\(n_1 \\cdot n_2\\).\nWe use the natural numbers for counting \u2018how many\u2019 of\nsomething there are, though they clearly fail when applied to infinite\nsets, for instance the set of squares of natural numbers or the set of\nnatural numbers themselves. This is what \u2018infinities of\ncounting\u2019 will extend, in section\n 3.3.\n\nThe integers consist of the natural numbers, their additive\ninverses (a number and its additive inverse sum to \\(0\\)), and\n\\(0\\): \n\\[\\dots , -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots.\\]\n\n\nThey form the most elementary number system that is also closed under\nsubtraction: If \\(j_1\\) and \\(j_2\\) are integers, then so is\n\\(j_1-j_2\\).\n\nThe rational numbers can be expressed in the form\n\\(j_1/j_2\\), where \\(j_1\\) and \\(j_2\\) are integers, \\(j_2\\neq 0\\).\nThey form the most elementary number system that includes the integers\nand that is closed under division, except by 0. If \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\)\nare rational numbers, \\(q_1/q_2\\) is also a rational number if\n\\(q_2\\neq 0\\).\n\nThe rational numbers are dense: for any two rational numbers\n\\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\) such that \\(q_1 < q_2\\), there is at least one\nrational number \\(q_3\\) such that \\(q_1 < q_3 < q_2\\)\u2014for\nexample, the arithmetic mean of \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\), \\((q_1+ q_2)/2\\),\nlies between them. Indeed, for any two rational numbers \\(q_1\\) and\n\\(q_2\\) such that \\(q_1\\) is strictly less than \\(q_2\\), for any\nnatural number \\(n\\), there are more than \\(n\\) distinct rational\nnumbers that lie between \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\). Where the integers\nspread infinitely \u2018outward\u2019 in both directions, the\nrationals also divide infinitely \u2018inward\u2019.\n\nHowever, the rational numbers still have \u201cgaps\u201d. For\ninstance, if we consider the equation, \\(y=x^3-2\\), we can verify that\nthere are values of \\(x\\) where \\(y\\) is negative, and values of \\(x\\)\nwhere \\(y\\) is positive. However, there is no rational number \\(x\\)\nfor which \\(y\\) is exactly equal to 0. To fill these gaps, we\nconstruct the \u201creal numbers\u201d.\n\nThe real numbers can be constructed out of the rational numbers by\ndefining each real number to be a Dedekind cut of the\nrationals. A Dedekind cut of the rationals is a pair of sets \\(L\\) and\n\\(R\\) such that:\n\n\n\nevery rational number belongs to exactly one of \\(L\\) and \\(R\\);\n\n\n\nevery member of \\(L\\) is less than each member of \\(R\\); and \n\n\n\\(L\\) has no largest element. \n\n\nWe refer to \\(L\\) as the \u2018left set\u2019 of the cut and \\(R\\)\nas the \u2018right set\u2019.\n\nFor any rational number \\(q\\), there is a Dedekind cut corresponding\nto it, where \\(L\\) consists of the numbers strictly less than \\(q\\),\nwhile \\(R\\) consists of \\(q\\) and all larger numbers. However, there\nare also other partitions, where \\(R\\) does not contain a smallest\nelement. For instance, we can let \\(L\\) include all the rational\nnumbers whose cube is less than 2, while \\(R\\) includes all the\nrational numbers whose cube is greater than 2. Since there is no\nrational number whose cube is exactly equal to 2, this pair of sets\nforms a partition, representing the real number we think of as the\ncube root of 2.\n\nIf \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are two real numbers, represented by Dedekind cuts\nwith left sets \\(x_L\\) and \\(y_L\\), and right sets \\(x_R\\) and\n\\(y_R\\), we can define operations of addition and multiplication of\nreal numbers in terms of operations on the members of these sets. The\nleft set of \\(x+y\\) is the set of all rational numbers that result\nfrom adding a member of \\(x_L\\) and a member of \\(y_L\\), while the\nright set is the set of all rational numbers that result from adding a\nmember of \\(x_R\\) and a member of \\(y_R\\). (It takes a little work to\ncheck that every rational number is in fact in one of these two sets,\nbut the other conditions for being a Dedekind cut are straightforward\nto check.) If \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are both positive, then we can define\nthe right set of \\(x\\cdot y\\) as the set of all rational numbers that\nresult from multiplying a member of \\(x_R\\) by a member of \\(y_R\\),\nwith the left set defined as the set of all other rational numbers.\n(Some modifications of this definition are needed if either \\(x\\) or\n\\(y\\) is negative.) Subtraction and division can then be defined as\nthe inverses of these operations, just as for the rationals.\n\nThe real numbers are closed under addition, subtraction,\nmultiplication, and division by all real numbers except 0. They have\nthe further feature that there are no \u201cgaps\u201d: for any\nbounded set of real numbers, there is a least upper bound, and for any\ncontinuous function from real numbers to real numbers, if the function\nis negative at one point and positive at another, there must be some\npoint at which it is exactly equal to 0. For further discussion, see\nthe entry on\n Dedekind\u2019s contributions to the foundations of mathematics.\n\nThere are several uses for which we want a number system with no gaps,\nand thus we use the real numbers. If you try to measure the amount of\nwater in a large vessel by counting out a specific number of small\ncups, there\u2019s no guarantee the number of cups will be an\ninteger. If you try to measure a long distance by counting out the\nlength of your foot, there\u2019s no guarantee the number of feet\nwill be an integer. We might know that something is more than 4 of the\nunits and less than 5. By moving to fractions of these units, we can\nget more precise\u20144 cups and 5 to 6 ounces, or 4 feet and 5 to 6\ninches\u2014but there\u2019s still no guarantee that a specific\nrational number will give the precise amount. But we can generate a\nsequence of approximations that get closer and closer by using smaller\nand smaller fractions of these units. So in measuring \u2018how\nmuch\u2019 of something there is, or giving coordinates to describe\nthe location of a point in geometric space, we use the real numbers,\nto guarantee, as we show in the next section, that there is some\nprecise value the sequence of approximations converges to.\n",
