    "main_text": "Theories of the Right to Secede || Plebiscitary Theories\n2.2 Plebiscitary Theories\n\n\nPlebiscitary (or voluntarist) theories are more permissive than\nremedial right only theories and ascriptivist theories: they permit\nunilateral secession in the absence of injustice and do not require\nthat the members of the seceding group share any characteristic other\nthan the desire to form their own state. Plebiscitary theorists ground\nthe right to secede in the right to self-determination\n(Wellman 2005: ch. 3). For them, self-determination is in\nitself of such great value that it can ground a right to complete\npolitical autonomy given certain conditions. The most prominent\nproponent of the plebiscitary view, Christopher Wellman, argues that\nthe right to self-determination generates a right to secede if and only\nif (a) any group that constitutes a majority within a portion of some\ngiven territory votes in favor of secession, (b) that group is willing\nand able to establish a well-functioning independent state, and (c) its\nsecession will not undermine the remainder state\u2019s ability to\nfunction as well (Wellman 1995; Wellman 2005: ch. 3; Altman and Wellman\n2009: ch. 3). Let us call (a) the majority vote condition and\nthe conjunction of (b) and (c) the state viability proviso.\nSatisfying the state viability proviso is not likely to be easy in most\ncases, particularly where the establishment of a new set of\ninstitutions is concerned. The viability proviso, then, limits the\npermissiveness of the plebiscitary view.\n\n\nPlebiscitary theories have many appealing features. First, they are\nable to avoid some of the problems that afflict the other main type of\nprimary right theory, ascriptivist theories, because they do not\nrequire either an account of what constitutes a nation nor an\nexplanation of why nations have a right to their own state. In\naddition, if a plebiscitary right to secede is widely acknowledged,\nthose wishing to secede need not frame their case in nationalist terms,\nwhich can provoke sometimes violent nationalistic responses from those\nwho oppose them. Second, they are less conservative than remedial right\nonly theories, as they permit a democratic redrawing of state\nboundaries\u2014which, in theory, allows for a greater degree of\nself-determination for the people that reside within them. This appeal\nto a democratic determination of state boundaries rather than the\nmaintenance of the status quo also advances an admirable commitment to\ndemocracy, understood as majority rule.\n\n\nThis view, like the others, faces many objections. One worry is that\nthe plebiscitary theory licenses morally problematic secessions of the\n\u201chaves\u201d from the \u201chave-nots:\u201d well-off\nmajorities in resource-rich portions of the state might divest\nthemselves of obligations to redistribute wealth to their less\nfortunate fellow citizens. In response, Wellman might appeal to the\nviability proviso: a secessionist party may not secede with the\ncommodities necessary for the continued functioning of the remainder\nstate. If they are located in a region that has the greater amount of\nnatural resources, for example, their right to secede is conditional on\ntheir willingness to share at least some of those resources with the\ncitizens of the remainder state. On this view, richer groups may secede\nfrom poorer groups\u2014however, the poorer group\u2019s reliance on\nthe resources held by the richer group establishes the terms by which\nthe secession may occur (Wellman 1995: p. 145).\n\n\nWhether this reply works depends on how much Wellman is willing to\npack into the requirement that the remainder state must still be able\nto \u201cfunction.\u201d Wellman\u2019s account is somewhat vague in\nthis regard, but it appears that he only includes the requirement that\nthe state be able to perform the functions needed to secure basic\nrights and justice, maintain order, and provide essential\ninfrastructure. If that is the case, then those who worry about\nlicensing the secession of the haves from the have-nots might argue\nthat the plebiscitary view permits the destruction of the modern\nwelfare state, a form of polity that often requires significant\nredistribution of wealth from better-off regions to less well-off ones.\nThough Wellman is not clear about precisely what functions are\nnecessary for the viability of a state, it is probable that the\nfunctions of a welfare state exceed the more minimal ones\nWellman\u2019s view likely requires. Thus, critics might argue,\nWellman\u2019s plebiscitary view is either a) too austerely\nlibertarian or b) requires a modification and expansion of the\nviability proviso that the secession not seriously damage the welfare\nfunctions of the remainder state.\n\n\nWellman, however, takes another approach. He argues that the\ncontinued sharing of resources from a newly created independent state\nwith the remainder state need not be limited to instances in which the\npoorer region would be left unviable without the seceding\nregion\u2019s support. Thus, his view leaves room for the possibility\nthat the people in the poorer region may still be entitled to some\nshare of the resources that is greater than what they need for mere\nviability- however that may be construed. Here, Wellman makes a\ndistinction between what he takes to be two separate questions: 1) what\ndo the citizens of the richer region owe to the citizens of the\nremainder state as a matter of justice? And 2) are the citizens of the\nricher region entitled to self-determination? As he would argue:\nwealthy spouses divorce their less wealthy spouses all the time. We\ndon\u2019t think that this inequality prohibits them from divorcing;\nrather, it establishes the terms by which they may permissibly do\nso\u2014and these terms more often than not require continued support\nof the less well-off spouse beyond what is minimally required for his\nsubsistence (Wellman 2005: p. 142\u20133).\n\n\nThe question of maintaining the wealth distribution of a welfare\nstate, then, is one of distributive justice, and does not immediately\nbear on the issue of whether or not a richer group has the right to\nsecede beyond a more minimal interpretation of the viability proviso.\nThat is to say that the richer group\u2019s right to\nself-determination is of sufficient weight to justify their secession\n(given the satisfaction of the requisite conditions), but it does not\nnecessarily outweigh any commitment to satisfying the welfare\nexpectations of those in the remainder state. The claims of\ndistributive justice may well require continued support of the\nworse-off beyond mere subsistence or viability claims. One difficulty\nwith this response is that it appears unrealistic under current\nconditions: once a region has achieved full independence, it will have\nlittle incentive to continue to share its resources with the remainder\nstate in order to preserve its welfare functions and there is no\neffective international agency to ensure that it does so.\n\n\nCritics of the plebiscitary theory raise the further objection that\nviews like Wellman\u2019s would result in a proliferation of\nsecessions. The domino effect objection, as it might be\ncalled, refers to the concern that, if all that is needed to establish\na potentially viable secessionist group is a mere majority vote in any\nplebiscite, then the institutionalization of this view will license the\nsecessions of increasingly numerous and subsequently smaller and\nsmaller groups. This would likely be disastrous for political and\neconomic stability in the given regions and internationally. Again,\nplebiscitary theorists refer back to the viability proviso in response.\nThe successful creation of a fully autonomous state that can both\nmaintain political legitimacy (through the satisfaction of its\npolitical functions) and that can be reasonably expected to persist\nover time is a tall order\u2014one that many (if not most) aspiring\nsecessionist groups are not likely to meet. Indeed, Wellman argues that\nthe likelihood of a secessionist group\u2019s ability to achieve such\nan ambitious and complex task decreases as its population and resources\ndwindle in size (Wellman 2005: p. 7\u20138). The viability proviso, then,\nserves as a practical limitation on the kinds of plebiscites that can\nin fact form viable secessionist groups, which significantly decreases\nthe likelihood that an international splintering of states will occur\nif the plebiscitary view were implemented.\n\n\nThe right to secede, of course, necessarily entails a right to the\nterritory on which the secessionists intend to establish their own\nindependent state. This territory will be taken, without consent, from\nthe original state. What gives the secessionists a stronger claim to\nterritory than that of the original state? How can the right to\nself-determination plus the desire of the majority for independent\nstatehood both general a territorial claim and cancel a\nlegitimate state\u2019s claim to the same?\n\n\nInstead of asking how the separatist group gains the right\nto territory, Wellman starts by asking why the original state has\nterritorial claims in the first place (Wellman 1995). He argues that\nthe state owes us an explanation as to why it can claim unilateral\ncoercive authority over us and the territories on which we live. The\nonly plausible explanation, he concludes, is functionality. So, Wellman\nhas a distinctly functionalist view of state authority\u2014the\nauthority of a state over its territory and people is legitimate\ninsofar and only insofar as it performs its necessary political\nfunctions to some satisfactory degree. A state\u2019s claim to sole\nauthority over a territory is thus generated by the use of that\nterritory to the performance of its political functions (Wellman 2005:\nch. 2).\n\n\nIn the context of this view, the existence of a politically viable\nand motivated internal separatist group calls into question the\nstate\u2019s claim to territory on which said group exists because a)\nits political viability proves that the state does not, in fact, need\ncontrol over that territory and population to maintain the requisite\ndegree of functionality (per the viability proviso); and b) the\nmajority of the people in that region prefers another political\narrangement by which they can satisfy the functionality requirements on\ntheir own. Given the fact that the original state does not need the\ncontested territory to create a politically secure and decently\nwell-functioning environment for its own citizens, the state\u2019s\nclaim to the disputed territory is not justified on the functionalist\nview (Altman and Wellman 2009: 47). The specific scenarios in which\nthis plays out will depend on how we construe political viability, but\nthe overarching argument from functionality remains the same: if the\ndisputed territory is not necessary for the proper functioning of the\nstate, then the state\u2019s claim to that territory and those who\nlive on it is (at the very least) vulnerable to being overridden by the\nself-determination claims of the aspiring secessionists.\n\n\nWellman\u2019s view on the potentially opposing territorial claims\nis thus grounded in his functionalist understanding of state legitimacy\nand his strong interpretation of the right to self-determination.\nAccording to the prevalent understanding of self-determination in\nmainstream political philosophy and international law, however, the\nright to self-determination includes only two features: freedom from\nexternal interference in self-governance and some minimally democratic\nform of government such that each member of the polity enjoys equal\npolitical participation rights. On this understanding, it appears that\nthe right to self-determination could only ground a right to territory\nif possessing their own territory is the only way in which a group\ncould be free of external interference or could achieve democracy. It\ndoes not encompass a right to take a portion of the territory of a\nstate that satisfies these two requirements. To respond to these\ncriticisms, the plebiscitary theory needs to be supplemented with a\nplausible theory of territorial rights that explains how the right to\nself-determination can generate a claim to territory in a portion of a\nlegitimate state in which all citizens already enjoy some sufficient\ndegree of self-determination.
