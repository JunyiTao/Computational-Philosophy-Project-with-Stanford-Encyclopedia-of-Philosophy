    "main_text": "Instrumental Coherence || Requirements of Reason to be Instrumentally Coherent As Such\n3.2 Requirements of Reason to be Instrumentally Coherent As Such\n\nThe Violation and Satisfaction Claims would be explained by a\nrequirement of reason to avoid or escape instrumental incoherence\nas such. Just as we ought not to torture, or ought to care\nfor our children, we ought to be instrumentally coherent as such.\n\nOne might instead suggest a weaker view: we have a reason to be\ninstrumentally coherent as such. But this weaker version faces a\ndifficulty in explaining the \u201cstrictness\u201d of the Violation\nClaim. One could have a reason to X without being under any\nrequirement to X, as when that reason to X\nis outweighed. But, according to the Violation Claim, whenever one is\ninstrumentally incoherent, one violates some requirement. This\n\u201cstrictness\u201d would thus remain unexplained by the weaker\nview (Broome 1999). Of course, the weaker view\u2014that we have a\nreason to be instrumentally coherent as such\u2014could be true even\nthough it fails to explain the Violation and Satisfaction Claims.\n(However, some philosophers have raised important challenges to the\n\u201cstrictness\u201d of rational requirements. Most notably, Fogal\n2020 suggests replacing a \u201crequirements-based\u201d account of\nstructural rationality with a \u201cpressure-based\u201d\naccount.)\n\nSo, let\u2019s work with the stronger view, according to which we\nought to be instrumentally coherent as such. One worry about this\nanswer is \u201cbootstrapping.\u201d Suppose that this requirement\nto be instrumentally coherent as such is stated in\n\u201cnarrow-scope\u201d form: if one intends to E and\nbelieves that one will E only if one intends to M,\nthen one is required to intend to M. Now suppose that one\nintends to stay in power and believes that one will do so only if one\nintends to kill one\u2019s rival. If one ought to be instrumentally\ncoherent as such, it would follow that one ought to intend to kill\none\u2019s rival. But that seems implausible. So, one may conclude,\nwe cannot understand \u201cone is rationally required\u201d as\nimplying \u201cone ought.\u201d\n3.2.1 Wide-Scoping and its Problems\n\nA natural reply, however, is that there is another way to be\ninstrumentally coherent: namely, to abandon the intention to stay in\npower. Thus, a requirement of instrumental coherence as such should\ntake \u201cwide-scope.\u201d It should say: one is required to\neither revise one\u2019s intention to E, or revise\none\u2019s belief that one will E only if one intends to\nM, or intend to M. (See especially Broome 1999 and\nWallace 2006. For earlier defenses of the wide-scope view, see Hill\n1973 and Darwall 1983.) So even if \u201cone is rationally\nrequired\u201d is taken to imply \u201cone ought,\u201d all that\nfollows is that one ought to either revise the intention to stay in\npower, or revise the belief that one will do so only if one intends to\nkill one\u2019s rival, or intend to kill one\u2019s rival. It does\nnot follow that one ought to intend to kill one\u2019s rival.\n\nHowever, there are some problems facing this approach, which we\noutline in the supplemental document\n Problems for Wide-Scoping.\n Some of those problems concern the allegedly implausible consequences\nthat emerge when we apply some of the transmission principles we\ndiscuss in\n \u00a72\n above\u2014specifically, Ought Necessity, Weak Reasons Necessity,\nand Weak Reasons Sufficiency\u2014to the relevant wide-scope ought in\ncertain cases. Other problems concern whether the wide-scope\nformulation is adequate as a formulation of the rational\nrequirement.\n3.2.2 What is the Reason?\n\nThere are other challenges facing the view that the Violation and\nSatisfaction Claims are explained by a requirement of reason to be\ninstrumentally coherent as such. The proponent of this view,\npresumably, should be able to say what the reason is to be\ninstrumentally coherent as such (see Kolodny 2005, \u00a72).\n\nKeep in mind that it won\u2019t be enough to state a reason to be\ndisposed to be instrumentally coherent. It doesn\u2019t\nfollow from one\u2019s having a reason to have a disposition that one\nhas a reason to manifest that disposition on every particular\noccasion. And so pointing to a reason to be disposed to be coherent\nwouldn\u2019t yield a reason to be instrumentally coherent as such.\n(As we\u2019ll see in\n \u00a74.4,\n a similar problem confronts the Kantian constitutivist view that\ncontinued instrumental incoherence threatens our status as agents.\nSince our agency isn\u2019t at risk with every instance of\ninstrumental incoherence, this account won\u2019t yield a reason to\nbe instrumentally coherent on every particular occasion; it would only\nprovide a reason to do so when one\u2019s incoherence is extreme\nenough to threaten one\u2019s status as an agent.) Furthermore, it is\nnot clear what reasons there are to be disposed to be instrumentally\ncoherent. It might be thought that being disposed to be instrumentally\ncoherent will make one more likely to conform to reason over the long\nrun. But given that instrumental coherence may just as soon be gained\nby revising one\u2019s attitudes against reason as in conformity to\nreason, one might doubt that this is so (Kolodny 2008b).\n\nThere\u2019s a reason to be skeptical that such a reason could be\nprovided. A reason to be instrumentally coherent as such would have to\napply at once to beliefs and intentions. But one might think that this\ncannot be the case: that reasons for belief and reasons for intention\nare fundamentally different in kind. Reasons for belief are\nconsiderations that show that the belief is likely to be true, whereas\nreasons for action are considerations that show that the action would\nrealize one\u2019s desires, or promote or respect something of\nvalue.\n\nSome philosophers have attempted to meet this challenge. Jonathan Way\n(2012a) has developed an account which points to the costs necessarily\ninvolved in intending to E without also intending to\nM, specifically the psychological resources that would be\nwasted (one\u2019s monitoring one\u2019s progress towards\nE-ing, being disposed to take means towards E-ing,\netc.). And Michael Bratman (2009c) has suggested that we have a reason\nto be instrumentally coherent as such because doing so is a necessary,\nconstitutive component of self-governance, and we have an intrinsic\nreason to govern ourselves. In his view, just as we have a reason not\nto torture, and a reason to care for our children, we have a reason to\ngovern ourselves. And one\u2019s being instrumentally incoherent on\nany particular occasion would be a way of failing to govern oneself.\nAlso, Alex Worsnip (2021, Ch.8) has argued that consideration about\ncoherence constitute (non-derivative) reasons to structure\ndeliberation in certain ways \u2014 in particular, they\nconstitute reasons to treat certain options as\n\u201coff-limits\u201d in one\u2019s deliberations. On this view,\nwe would have reason to treat the instrumentally incoherent\ncombination [intending to X, not intending to Y, believing intending\nto Y is necessary for X-ing] as off-limits. Why is there such a\nreason? For Worsnip, it\u2019s simply fitting to stucture\ndeliberation in a way that respects coherence constraints.\n",
