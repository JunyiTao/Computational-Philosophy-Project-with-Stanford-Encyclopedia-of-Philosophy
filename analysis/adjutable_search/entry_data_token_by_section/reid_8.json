But, according\nto Reid, the underlying rationale for these commitments is typically\nnot even stated by proponents of the Way of Ideas; it is most often\ntaken for granted, or supported with demonstrably weak arguments. As a\nresult, the rationale for commitments to an ontology of ideas and to\ntheir functional roles in the mind does not confer upon that\ncommitment much epistemic justification. In the context of a passage\nin which Reid imagines a dialogue between \u201cthe vulgar\u201d or\nthe common person on the one hand and \u201cthe philosopher\u201d on\nthe other, Reid develops this reasoning as follows:\nWhen, therefore, in common language, we speak of having an\nidea of anything, we mean no more by that expression, but thinking of\nit. The vulgar allow that this expression implies a mind that thinks,\nan act of that mind which we call thinking, and an object about which\nwe think. But, besides these three, the philosopher conceives that\nthere is a fourth\u2014to wit, the idea, which is the\nimmediate object. The idea is in the mind itself, and can have no\nexistence but in a mind that thinks; but the remote or mediate object\nmay be something external, as the sun or moon; it may be something\npast or future; it may be something which never existed. This is the\nphilosophical meaning of the word idea; and we may\nobserve that this meaning of that word is built upon a philosophical\nopinion: for, if philosophers had not believed that there are such\nimmediate objects of all our thoughts in the mind, they would never\nhave used the word idea to express them. (EIP 1.1, 31)\n\n\nThe Way of Ideas philosopher must talk the man on the street out of\nthe belief that \u201cWhen I perceive an apple in front of me, the\napple is the very thing I'm perceiving.\u201d The philosopher's\nresponse\u2014that this is a mistake, that the object of perception\nis an idea of the apple\u2014is predicated upon a rejection of the\nvulgar's conception of everyday thoughts about objects. But this\nrejection appears to rest in the opinion of philosophers rather than\nin the entailment of some as yet unstated but decisive argument. As a\nresult, the rationale for commitments to an ontology of ideas and to\ntheir functional roles in the mind appears to Reid to be as dubious,\nif not more, than the man on the street's original commitment to a\ndirect form of perception. If Reid is correct, then this shifts the\nburden of proof back upon the advocate of ideas.\n\n\nSecond, in a structurally similar argument, Reid observes something\nimportant about the intended explanatory power of the representational\ntheory of perception. That theory is intended to explain the fact that\nour mental states manage to connect to real objects, manage to\nbe about real objects. However, this fact about\nbeliefs is only explained by the model if the model is less obscure\nthan the phenomena to be explained by it. But, Reid observes, if we\nnotice that we do not understand how it is that we manage to connect\nour minds to objects in the world, then it cannot help to say that we\ndo this by first connecting our minds to mental representations unless\nwe understand how it is that we manage to connect our minds to those\nmental representations. This consideration gives the following\nquestion its force: Why is the perception of a mental intermediary\nlike an idea supposed to be more intelligible than the direct\nperception of a physical object? If it is no more intelligible, then\nthe representational theory is not serving to explain what it was\nintended to explain. (See EIP 2.14, 185.)\n\n\nIn addition to burden of proof arguments against the Way of Ideas and\nthe representational theory of perception, Reid also deploys a number\nof detailed arguments against specific components of these theories\nand against commitments they presuppose to be true. Though these\narguments are unsuitable for recapitulation in the format of an\nencyclopedia entry, we report one such argument in brief in an effort\nto offer a hint at the robust detail, nuanced reasoning, and attention\nto physiological facts in Reid's theory of perception.\n\n\nIn one of a small handful of arguments that David Hume explicitly\noffers for a representational theory of perception, he concludes that\n\u201cnothing can ever be present to the mind but an image or\nperception\u201d (Enquiry 12.9; see Treatise\n1.4.1.12, 187) by reasoning from considerations having to do with what\nis known as \u2018perceptual relativity\u2019. Hume writes, \u201cThe table,\nwhich we see, seems to diminish, as we remove farther from it: but the\nreal table, which exists independent of us, suffers no alteration: it\nwas, therefore, nothing but its image, which was present to the\nmind. These are the obvious dictates of reason\u201d\n(Enquiry 12.9). This is perhaps the most compelling argument\nfor the representational theory of perception.\n\n \nReid responds to this argument with several objections. First, Reid's\nanalysis of each of the senses in Inquiry convince him that\nsome senses do not represent physical objects in the same way that all\nthe others do. Touch (IHM ch. 6), for example, presents qualities of\nobjects to the mind in ways more direct than does vision (IHM ch. 7),\nresulting in what has been referred to as Reid's hybrid theory of\nperception. A conclusion generalized to all the senses (\u201cnothing\ncan ever be present...\u201d) but based solely on one sense is\ntherefore invalid.\n\n \nThe next of Reid's objections is more involved, requiring introduction\nof a key distinction Reid makes on the basis of his attention to the\nphenomenology of visual experience. First, though, notice Hume's use\nof the term \u2018table\u2019 and \u2018the real table\u2019 in the argument above.\nFollowing Berkeley's New Theory of Vision, Reid distinguishes\nbetween visible figure from tangible figure (IHM 6.2, 81\u20132), or later,\nwhich is virtually the same distinction, between \u2018apparent magnitude\u2019\nand \u2018real magnitude\u2019 (EIP 2.14, 181). The tangible or real figure of\nan object is measured by yards or inches, but the visible figure is\nnot. Instead, the visible figure depends for its geometric\nproperties\u2014the surface area that the table occupies in the\nvisual field\u2014upon properties of the tangible figure, including\nits shape and its distance from the eyes. Reid recognizes the obvious\nphenomenon of perceptual relativity, for example, that when I see a\ntable at 10 yards and at 100, its \u201cvisible appearance, in its\nlength, breadth, and all its linear proportions, is ten times less in\nthe last case than it is in the first\u201d (IHM 6.2, 81\u20132). The\ntangible figure is measured by different means, sensed by a different\nfaculty, and is extended in three dimensions. This leads Reid to argue\nthat \u201cThe ingenious author has imposed upon himself by\nconfounding real magnitude with apparent magnitude,\u201d that is,\nHume equivocates (EIP 2.14, 182).\n\n \nA pressing question arises at this juncture: Hasn't Reid now adopted a\nposition according to which there are perceptual intermediaries in the\nvisual perception process? If so, doesn't this imply that Reid's\ntheory will share many of the foibles with which he charges the Way of\nIdeas? Most answers to these two questions have proven to be\ncontentious in part because Reid's interpreters often bring to this\nissue prefabricated, a priori definitions of \u2018intermediary\u2019,\n\u2018representation\u2019 and \u2018directness\u2019. While Reid's theory of visual\nperception implies that visible figures are seen, visible figures are\nradically unlike ideas. Visible figure is not merely a\nrepresentational intermediary; it is a relational property between\nphysical objects and eyes of perceivers. Only because ideas lack these\ncharacteristics is Hume able to reason from the claim that\nmind-independent tables are not immediate objects of awareness to his\nstated conclusion above that we immediately perceive only ideas or\nrepresentations. That is the first of two important points in response\nto the first question.\n\n \nThe second enters into Reid's development of a consistent geometry for\nvisible space, perhaps the most technically brilliant piece of writing\nby any major British empiricist. This work allows Reid a crucial reply\nto advocates of representational theories. Reid discovered and\nmathematically described a law-like variation in the visible figure of\nan external object with intrinsic (shape, size) and extrinsic\n(distance, angle of orientation) properties of the tangible\nfigure. Reid summarizes his conclusion writing: \n[T]he real table may be placed successively at a thousand\ndifferent distances, and, in every distance, in a thousand different\npositions; and it can be determined demonstratively by the rules of\ngeometry and perspective, what must be its apparent magnitude and\napparent figure, in each of those distances and positions.\u201d (EIP\n2.14, 183)\n\n \nHume assumes that the relationship between a visible figure and a\ntangible figure is subjective and mind-dependent. Not only is\nthat erroneous, but, given Reid's work, the systematic variation of\nthe visible figure with the tangible figure is in fact evidence for\nthe objectivity of its independence from one's mind.\n\n\nReid further argues that this objective relationship between, for\nexample, seeing the visible figure of a coin\nand conceiving of the coin becomes automated over time\nthrough repeated experience. Perhaps the first time I saw a coin it\nwas presented to me at an angle, its visible figure an ellipse. I\nmight mistakenly form a perceptual belief about an elliptical object,\neven though the coin is circular. Over time, this process is\nhabituated through a process that Reid describes with the help of a\ndistinction between original and acquired perceptions. In short, my\nfaculty of visual perception, if given experience, will successfully\nmodel the geometrically demonstrable relationship between visible\nfigure and tangible figure.\n\n\nThis family of arguments has received considerable attention due to a\nnumber of its complexities. These involve attempts to answer questions\nincluding the following: As we have seen, through his science of\nperspectival shapes of objects Reid argues that they are geometrically\nequivalent to shapes projected onto surfaces of spheres. What is\nReid's formal proof for this, and is it valid (Yaffe 2002)? Does Reid\noffer the first recorded non-Euclidean geometry in the history of\nmathematics (Daniels 1972)? What is the bearing of Reid's repeated\nattempts to derive Euclid's parallel postulate from the axioms of\nincidence on an interpretation of the geometry of visible space as\nnon-Euclidean (Grandi 2005)? Where does Reid's theory of perception\nand geometry of visibles leave the ontology of visible figure (Nichols\n2007, ch. 4)? In what ways is visible figure the object of visual\nperception, and in what ways not (Yaffe 2003; Falkenstein and Grandi\n2003)? Does Reid's geometry of visible space jeopardize his theory's\nability to avoid a representational theory of visual perception (Van\nCleve 2002)? Does visible figure and awareness of it preclude\nnon-inferential perceptual knowledge from vision, or rather, what is\nthe relationship between original and acquired perceptions and visible\nfigure (Nichols 2007, ch. 8)?\n\n \nNow that we know how and why Reid argues against the Way of Ideas'\nrepresentational theory of perception, we needn't address these\nquestions in order to continue with a discussion of the components of\nReid's own more direct theory of perception. Here we need to keep in\nmind the fact that, though contemporary philosophers write a priori\nabout perception, sensation, and knowledge, Reid does not offer\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for perception or for its\ncomponent processes. Consistent with his Newtonian empiricism, Reid is\naiming for something else altogether: observations and accurate\nexperiments that reduce to general rules (EIP 1.3, 49\u201350; EIP 2.8,\n120\u20131). Though operations of our intellectual powers are not definable\nor analyzable a priori, it is possible to describe the operations Reid\nhas in mind.\n\n \nAccording to Reid, the perceptual process operates as\nfollows. Individuals with functioning sensory organs and a developed\nbrain interact with physical objects in the world. These objects cause\nsensory experiences in individuals. These sensations function as\nnatural signs for qualities of the objects. The experience of a\nsensation orients my cognition so as to form a conception of a quality\nof a mind-independent object. Sometimes, though rarely, an\nindividual's perception of an object will not only cause a sensation\nbut will also cause the person to become aware of the\nsensation\u2014perhaps even at the exclusion of any further awareness\nof primary qualities of the object. For example, when I get hit by a\nbaseball thrown 90 mph I focus on my pain sensations, not the\nqualities of the ball. To perceive an object is to be aware of the\nobject or its quality in a particular way, as the possessor of a\nparticular quality, and, at the same time, to be\nconvinced that the object exists and is as it is conceived it to\nbe. To defend a common sensical theory of perception that is supported\nby observation and experiment, and that is capable of delivering\nknowledge of real objects, Reid thinks he needs to show that we\nare directly aware of real objects, in contrast to key\nfeatures of the Way of Ideas' representational theory of\nperception just discussed. While there is debate over the precise\nsense in which, for Reid, we are directly aware of objects, this much\nseems clear: whatever the sense of \u201cdirect\u201d is in which\nthe subscribers to the representational theory take us to be directly\naware of ideas, it is in that sense that Reid takes us to be\ndirectly aware of real objects.\n",
