There are three long-standing answers to\nthis question: realism, nominalism, and\nconceptualism.\n\nAccording to realists, universals exist as mind-independent entities.\nIn transcendent realism, put forward by Plato, they exist\neven if uninstantiated and are thus \u201ctranscendent\u201d or\n\u201cante res\u201d (\u201cbefore the things\u201d). In\nimmanent realism, defended by Aristotle in opposition to his\nmaster, they are \u201cimmanent\u201d or \u201cin\nrebus\u201d (\u201cin things\u201d), as they exist only if\ninstantiated by objects. Contemporary notable supporters are Russell\n(1912) for the former and Armstrong (1978a) for the latter (for recent\ntakes on this old dispute see the essays by Loux, Van Inwagen, Lowe\nand Galluzzo in Galluzzo & Loux 2015). Transcendentism is of\ncourse a less economical position and elicits epistemological worries\nregarding our capacity to grasp ante res universals.\nNevertheless, such worries may be countered in various ways (cf. entry\non\n platonism in metaphysics, \u00a75;\n Bealer 1982: 19\u201320; 1998: \u00a72; Linsky & Zalta 1995),\nand uninstantiated properties may well have work to do, particularly\nin capturing the intuitive idea that there are unrealized\npossibilities and in dealing with cognitive content (see\n \u00a73).\n A good summary of pro-transcendentist arguments and immanentist\nrejoinders is offered by Allen (2016: \u00a72.3). See also Costa\nforthcoming\u00a0for a new criticism of immanentism, based on the\nnotion of grounding.\n\nNominalists eschew mind-independent universals. They may either resort\nto tropes in their stead, or accept predicate nominalism,\nwhich tries to make it without mind-independent properties at all, by\ntaking the predicates themselves to do the classifying job that\nproperties are supposed to do. This is especially indigestible to a\nrealist, since it seems to put the cart before the horse by making\nlanguage and mind responsible for the similarities we find in the rich\nvarieties of things surrounding us. Some even say that this involves\nan idealist rejection of a mind-independent world (Hochberg 2013).\nConceptualists also deny that there are mind-independent universals,\nand because of this they are often assimilated to nominalists. Still,\nthey can be distinguished insofar as they replace such universals with\nconcepts, understood as non-linguistic mind-dependent entities,\ntypically functioning as meanings of predicates. The mind-dependence\nof concepts however makes conceptualism liable to the same kind of\ncart/horse worry just voiced above in relation to predicate\n nominalism.[3]\n\nThe arguments considered in\n \u00a71.2\n constitute the typical motivation for realism, which is the stance\nthat we take for granted here. They may be configured as an abductive\ninference to the best explanation (Swoyer 1999). Thus, of course, they\nare not foolproof, and in fact nominalism is still a popular view,\nwhich is discussed in detail in the entry on\n nominalism in metaphysics,\n as well as in the entry on\n tropes.\n Conceptualism appears to be less common nowadays, although it still\nhas supporters (cf. Cocchiarella 1986a: ch. 3; 2007), and it is worth\nnoting that empirical research on concepts is flourishing.\n",
