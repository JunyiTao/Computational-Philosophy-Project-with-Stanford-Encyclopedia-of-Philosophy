    "main_text": "Theories, Causes, and Explanations in Medicine\n3. Theories, Causes, and Explanations in Medicine\n\nThere is no widely accepted notion of what a scientific theory is. The\nlogical positivists thought that theories are sets of\npropositions, formalizable in first-order logic, at one point, and as\nclasses of set-theoretic models at another. For our purposes here one\ncan distinguish two senses of theory, a narrower and a broader sense.\nIn the narrower sense, a theory comprises a set of symbols and\nconcepts used to represent the entities in a domain of discourse as\nwell as a set of simple general-purpose principles that describe the\nbehavior of these entities in abstract terms. In the broader sense,\ntheory refers to any statement or set of statements used to explain\nthe phenomena of a given domain.\n\nIn medicine one can find theories in both the narrower and the broader\nsense. Humorism, for instance, holds that the human body is filled\nwith four basic substances or \u201chumors\u201d: black bile, yellow\nbile, phlegm, and blood. The humors are in balance in a healthy\nperson; diseases are explained by excesses or deficiencies in one or\nmore humors. Humorism has ancient origins and influenced Western\nmedicine well into the 18th century. Eastern medicine has analogous\nsystems of thought. Indian Ayurveda medicine, for example, is a theory\nof the three primary humors wind, bile, and phlegm, and diseases are\nsimilarly understood as imbalances in humors (Magner 2002).\n\nIn contemporary Western medicine, such highly unifying and general\ntheories play a limited role, however. Evolutionary and Darwinian medicine may\nwell constitute exceptions but these are at best emergent fields at\npresent (see M\u00e9thot 2011). Contemporary Western medical\nresearchers and practitioners instead seek to explain medical outcomes\nusing mechanistic hypotheses about their causes\u2014symptoms by\nhypotheses about diseases, diseases by hypotheses about antecedents,\nepidemics by hypotheses about changes in environmental or behavioral\nconditions (Thagard 2006). What distinguishes these contemporary\nmedical theories from the ancient approaches is that the causes of\nsymptoms, diseases, and epidemics can in principle be as multifarious\nas the outcomes themselves; in the ancient approaches, lack of humoral\nbalance was the only possible cause. In contemporary Western medicine, \nthere is no presupposition concerning number, form, or mode of action \nof the causes that explain the outcome other than there being \nsome cause or set of causes responsible.\n\nNot every cause is equally explanatory. A given person\u2019s death\ncan be described as one by cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism or lung\ncancer, for instance. The lung cancer may have had a genetic mutation,\nthe deposition of carcinogens in lung tissue and smoking in its causal\nhistory. The smoking, in turn, was caused by the smoker\u2019s\nproneness to addictive behavior, peer pressure and socio-economic\nenvironment, let us suppose. Which of the many candidate hypotheses of\nthe form \u201cX causes (or caused) Y\u201d, where\nY refers to the patient\u2019s death, does best explain the\noutcome? There is no absolute answer to this question. The goodness of\na medical explanation depends in part on the context in which it is\ngiven (see entry on\n scientific explanation).\n When asked \u201cWhy did Y happen?\u201d a coroner might\nrefer to the pulmonary embolism, the patient\u2019s physician to the\nlung cancer and an epidemiologist to the patient\u2019s tobacco\nconsumption. The adequacy of a medical explanation is related to our\nability to intervene on the factor in question. A pulmonary embolism\ncan be prevented by screening the patient for blood clots. The\naccumulation of carcinogens in lung tissue can be prevented by\nstopping smoking. By contrast, even though certain kinds of genetic\nmutations are in the causal history of any cancer, the mutation is not\nat present of much explanatory interest to most clinicians, as this is\nnot a factor on which they can easily intervene. There is considerable\ncurrent medical research to identify mutations associated with various\nsubtypes of cancer and using these to develop targeted therapies and\ninterventions, as well as to provide more accurate prognostic\ninformation. Medical explanation, thus, is closely related to our instrumental \ninterests in controlling, preventing and controlling outcomes (Whitbeck 1977).\n\nOne issue that is currently debated in the philosophy of medicine is\nthe desirability (or lack thereof) of citing information about the\nmechanisms responsible for a medical outcome to explain this outcome.\nWhile mechanisms are usually characterized in causal terms (e.g.,\nGlennan 2002; Woodward 2002; Steel 2008), it is not the case that\nevery cause acts through or is a part of some mechanism, which is\nunderstood as a more or less complex arrangement of causal factors\nthat are productive of change (e.g., Machamer et al. 2000). Absences,\nsuch as lack of sunlight, can cause medical outcomes but are not\nrelated to them through continuous mechanisms from cause to effect\n(Reiss 2012). Neuroscientific explanations are often acceptable\ndespite the lack of knowledge or false assumptions about mechanisms\n(Weber 2008). However, we may ask whether mechanistic explanations are \ngenerally preferable to non-mechanistic causal explanations.\n\nMany medical researchers and philosophers of medicine subscribe to a\nreductionist paradigm, according to which bottom-up explanations that\nfocus on the generative physiological mechanisms for medical outcomes\nare the only acceptable ones or at least always preferable. Indeed,\nmacro-level claims such as \u201cSmoking causes lung cancer\u201d\nseem to raise more questions than they answer: Why does smoking have\nadverse health consequences? To prevent these consequences, is it\nnecessary to stop smoking? Is it possible to produce cigarettes the\nsmoking of which has fewer or no adverse consequences? What is the\nbest policy to improve morbidity and mortality from lung cancer?\nKnowing that it is specific carcinogens in tobacco smoke and genetic\nsusceptibility that are jointly responsible for the onset of the\ndisease helps to address many of these questions.\n\nNevertheless it would be wrong to assume that we cannot explain\noutcomes without full knowledge of the mechanisms responsible. When,\nin the mid-1950s, smoking was established as a cause of lung cancer,\nit was certainly possible to explain lung cancer epidemics in many\ncountries where people had exchanged pipe smoking for cigarette\nsmoking half a century earlier\u2014even though the mechanism of\naction was not understood at the time. Differences in lung cancer\nincidence between men and women or between different countries can be\nexplained with reference to different smoking behaviors. Policy\ninterventions, in this case the addition of warning labels to\ncigarette packets, could not wait until sufficient mechanistic\nknowledge was available, nor did they have to wait.\n\nFor reasons such as these, a number of philosophers of medicine have\nproposed to adopt an \u201cexplanatory pluralism\u201d for medicine\n(De Vreese et al. 2010; Campaner 2012). If nothing else, this is\ncertainly a position that is consistent with the explanatory practices\nin the field.\n",
