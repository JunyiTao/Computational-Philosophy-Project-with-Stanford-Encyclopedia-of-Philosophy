    "main_text": "Hermeneutics as Historical Movement || Justification of the Human Sciences\n2.2 Justification of the Human Sciences\n\nThe history of the modern origins of hermeneutics includes distinctive\ncontributions by Wilhelm Dilthey. Whereas Schleiermacher\u2019s\nhermeneutics is closely associated with German romanticism,\nDilthey\u2019s considerations may be grasped in connection with\nhistoricism. \u2018Historicism\u2019 refers to a nineteenth- and\nearly twentieth-century intellectual movement that no longer treated\n\u201chuman nature, morality, and reason as absolute, eternal, and\nuniversal,\u201d but sought, instead, to grasp these as\n\u201crelative, changing and particular,\u201d shaped by historical\ncontext (Beiser 2011, 1). Dilthey\u2019s overall (though never\ncompleted) project was to establish a critique of historical reason\nthat would secure independent epistemological foundations of research\nin the human sciences, that is, the sciences distinguished by their\nfocus on historical experience (Grondin 1994, 84\u201390; Bambach\n1995, 127\u2013185; Makkreel 2015). In this, Dilthey\u2019s concern\nis to defend the legitimacy of the human sciences against charges\neither that their legitimacy remains dependent on norms and methods of\nthe natural sciences or, to his mind worse, that they lack the kind of\nlegitimacy found in the natural sciences altogether.\n\nDilthey associates the purpose of the human sciences not with the\nexplanation of \u2018outer\u2019 experience, but, instead, with the\nunderstanding of \u2018lived experience\u2019 (Erlebnis).\nIn an important essay, \u201cThe Rise of Hermeneutics,\u201d Dilthey\naffirms that the understanding achieved in the human sciences involves\ninterpretation. But this means that hermeneutics, grasped as the\ntheory of the universal validity of interpretation, does more than lay\nout the rules of successful interpretive practice. Hermeneutics\nclarifies the validity of the research conducted in the human\nsciences. Indeed, he ventures that the \u201cmain purpose\u201d of\nhermeneutics is \u201cto preserve the general validity of\ninterpretation against the inroads of romantic caprice and skeptical\nsubjectivity, and to give a theoretical justification of such\nvalidity, upon which all the certainty of historical knowledge is\nfounded\u201d (Dilthey, \u201cThe Rise of Hermeneutics,\u201d\nSection V).\n\nWhile Schleiermacher and Dilthey are central for the modern historical\norigins of hermeneutics, hermeneutics has also been shaped by\ncontributions from other figures, such as Friedrich Ast. And\nhermeneutics has also been influenced by ideas about meaning, history,\nand language developed in the period by figures such as Johann\nGottfried Herder, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and Friedrich Schlegel (see\nGrondin 1994; Rush 2020).\n",
