Philosophy of Physics\n\nAlthough Mario Bunge and Roberto Torretti were central figures for the\nphilosophy of physics in Latin America, their early emigration\nprevented them from starting research lines around their works. As a\nconsequence, the development of the philosophy of physics in the\nregion is relatively recent.\n Quantum mechanics is one of the focuses of the research group led\nby Olimpia Lombardi which developed its work in two directions: the\ninterpretation of the theory and the analysis of the meaning of\ndecoherence. Regarding the first topic, Lombardi and Mario Castagnino\nproposed the modal-Hamiltonian interpretation of quantum mechanics: a\nrealist, non-collapse interpretation that endows the Hamiltonian with\na determining role. The interpretation proved to be effective in\nexplaining ideal and non-ideal measurements and many other well-known\nphysical situations such as hydrogen atom, Zeeman effect, fine\nstructure, etc. (Lombardi and Castagnino 2008). The interpretation was\nreformulated in a Galilean invariant form (Ardenghi, Castagnino, and\nLombardi 2009; Lombardi, Castagnino, and Ardenghi 2010), and was\napplied to further situations, such as the non-collapse account of\nconsecutive measurements in physics (Ardenghi, Lombardi, and Narvaja\n2013), the understanding of quantum decoherence (Lombardi, Ardenghi,\nFortin, and Castagnino 2011), the view of quantum measurement in\ninformational terms (Lombardi, Fortin, and L\u00f3pez 2015), and the\nproblem of optical isomerism in chemistry (Fortin, Lombardi, and\nMart\u00ednez Gonz\u00e1lez 2016, 2018). In addition, the\nmodal-Hamiltonian interpretation proposes a bundle-of-properties\nontology that adequately accounts for contextuality and\nindistinguishability (da Costa, Lombardi, and Lastiri 2013; da Costa\nand Lombardi 2014), but without preventing the emergence of particles\nunder certain particular circumstances (Lombardi and Dieks 2016).\n By stressing the distinction between collapse and decoherence,\nOsvaldo Pessoa (1997) criticized the assumption that decoherence\nsolves the measurement problem. Following Pessoa\u2019s view,\nCastagnino, Sebastian Fortin, and Lombardi (2010) deepened the\ncriticisms of the orthodox approach to decoherence (see also Lombardi,\nFortin, and Castagnino 2012; Fortin and Lombardi 2014, 2017), proposed\na new approach for closed systems (Castagnino and Lombardi 2004;\nFortin and Lombardi 2018), and developed a general conceptual\nframework for decoherence in closed and open systems (Castagnino,\nLaura, and Lombardi 2007). On the basis of this new perspective, the\nresearch group offered a particular view of the classical limit of\nquantum mechanics (Castagnino and Lombardi 2005; Fortin and Lombardi\n2016) and applied it to the problem of defining the quantum ergodic\nhierarchy (Castagnino and Lombardi 2007; G\u00f3mez and Castagnino\n2014).\n\nIn the subtle frontier between logic and physics, D\u00e9cio Krause\ndeveloped an impressive work related to the quantum challenges to\nthe notions of identity and individuality. Already in his PhD\ndissertation, under the supervision of Newton da Costa, Krause\nsupplied a semantics to the so-called \u201cSchr\u00f6dinger\nlogic\u201d (da Costa and Krause 1994, 1997) designed to account for\nelementary quantum particles. This work led him to formulate his\nquasi-set theory (Krause 1991, 1992, 1996a, 1996b), according\nto which there are urelements for which identity makes no sense.\nKrause\u2019s semi-extensional quasi-set theory was compared with the\nintensional quaset theory developed by Maria Luisa dalla Chiara and\nGiuliano Toraldo di Francia (dalla Chiara, Giuntini, and Krause 1998),\nand was applied to particular problems in the foundations of quantum\nmechanics (Sant\u2019Anna and Krause 1997; Krause, Sant\u2019Anna,\nand Volkov 1999; Krause 2000; Domenech, Holik, and Krause 2008).\n\nKrause also developed an intense collaboration with Steven French to\ndevelop a concept of individuality for the quantum ontology (Krause\nand French 1995, 2007; French and Krause 1995, 1999, 2003); they also\nadvanced some ideas about individuality in quantum field theory\n(French and Krause 2010). This collaboration gave rise to a very\nrelevant book on the matter (French and Krause 2006), which discusses\nthe problem of individuality in philosophy and in classical and\nquantum physics and articulates quasi-set theory as a theory for\nnon-individuals.\n More recently, Krause produced a relevant collaborative work with\nJonas Arenhart, his former PhD student, about quantum\nnon-individuality (Krause and Arenhart 2012, 2016a) and its\ncompatibility with Einstein\u2019s realism (Krause and Arenhart\n2014). They also examined the view of quantum particles as individuals\nin a primitive sense (Arenhart and Krause 2014a, 2014b). This\ncollaboration led to a recent book about the logical foundations of\nscientific theories (Krause and Arenhart 2016b). In recent years,\nKrause also worked with da Costa in the application of paraconsistent\nlogics to physics (da Costa and Krause 2014, 2016).\n Still in the field of the interpretation of quantum mechanics,\nEl\u00edas Okon and Daniel Sudarsky (2014a, 2014b) criticized Robert\nGriffiths\u2019s consistent histories approach by arguing that it is\ninterpretively vague and does not solve the measurement problem. These\nworks were rebutted by Griffiths (2015), and the rebuttal was\nimmediately answered by Okon and Sudarsky (2015a) by claiming that the\nconsistent histories interpretation introduces anthropomorphic terms\nnot contained in the formalism. In turn, based on Okon and\nSudarsky\u2019s criticism, Marcelo Losada and Lombardi (2018) defend\na \u201cformalism of contextual histories\u201d which is free from\nthe shortcomings of Griffiths\u2019s proposal.\n\nGiven the need for an observer-independent interpretation of quantum\nmechanics for cosmology, Okon and Sudarsky (2014c) defended an\nobjective collapse theory for the application to cosmology and quantum\ngravity, and on this basis, they proposed an adaptation of objective\ncollapse models to a general relativistic context (2018a). The authors\nalso examined the black hole information loss paradox as a situation\nthat can be accounted for by collapse interpretations (Okon and\nSudarsky 2015b, 2017, 2018b).\n Other aspects and interpretations of quantum mechanics have also\nbeen explored. For instance, Sergio Mart\u00ednez explored the\nphysical content of the Luders Rule (1990, 1991), Pessoa (2005)\nproposed a modal logical treatment of quantum mechanics, and Pablo\nAcu\u00f1a (2016b) pointed out the difficulties in defining the\nnotion of inertial trajectory in Bohmian mechanics which is considered\na different theory and not a different interpretation of quantum\nmechanics (Acu\u00f1a forthcoming). In turn, Rodolfo Gambini, Luis\nPedro Garc\u00eda-Pintos, and Jorge Pullin (2010, 2011) devised an\ninterpretation that offers a solution to the quantum measurement\nproblem based on the loss of coherence due to the use of realistic\nclocks.\n\nMatters not directly related to quantum mechanics have also been\nstudied by Latin American philosophers of physics. For instance,\nAcu\u00f1a (2016a) critically assessed the debate concerning the\ndirection of explanation between Minkowski spacetime and the Lorentz\ninvariance of dynamical laws. Diego Romero-Maltrana (2015) analyzes\nthe relationship between symmetries and conserved quantities supported\nby Noether\u2019s theorems in order to argue for the priority of\nconserved quantities over symmetries.\n The problem of time\u2019s arrow was addressed by Castagnino,\nLombardi and collaborators by elaborating on John Earman\u2019s\nheresy (1974) according to which the arrow of time is a geometrical\nproperty of the universe (Castagnino, Lombardi, and Lara 2003). This\nglobal arrow is transferred to the local domain as an energy flow that\npoints to the same time direction on the entire spacetime (Castagnino\nand Lombardi 2009), which in turn supplies the foundations for local\nirreversible theories (Aiello, Castagnino, and Lombardi 2008).\nCastagnino and Lombardi also collaborated with Manuel Gadella, one of\nthe authors of the time-asymmetric quantum mechanics, in order to\nanalyze irreversibility and time\u2019s arrow in the quantum realm\n(Castagnino, Gadella, and Lombardi 2006), a work recently followed by\nCristian L\u00f3pez (2019).\n4.2. Philosophy of Chemistry\n\nAlthough the philosophy of chemistry is a relatively young\nsubdiscipline in philosophy of science,it has attracted the interest\nof several researchers in Latin America.\n\nThe group led by Olimpia Lombardi worked on the topic since 2005 when\na paper advocating for the ontological autonomy of chemistry (Lombardi\nand Labarca 2005) was published. The paper sparked a hot debate which\nbegan with a criticism by Paul Needham (2006) that was immediately\nresponded by Lombardi and Labarca (2006), and was followed by many\nother authors. In the meantime, Labarca and Lombardi (2010) also argued for\nthe existence of orbitals in the ontology of chemistry relying on\nontological pluralism. On the basis of the impact of her view,\nLombardi (2014a) reviewed and organized the different criticisms and\noffered a systematic response to them; in turn, with Mariana\nC\u00f3rdoba, she stressed the Kantian roots of her ontological\npluralism (C\u00f3rdoba and Lombardi 2013).\n\nGiven her antireductionist perspective, Lombardi (2013, 2014b) also\ncriticized the book of Hinne Hettema (2012), Reducing Chemistry to\nPhysics, stressing the many difficulties that must be faced by\nthose who insist on the reduction of chemistry to physics; the papers\nreceived immediate replies from Hetterma (2014).\n The problems regarding the relations between chemistry and physics\nwere addressed by Lombardi\u2019s group from various perspectives. In\nparticular, they brought to light several interpretive issues of\nquantum mechanics that are not accommodated when the theory is used in\nchemistry (Lombardi and Castagnino 2010; Mart\u00ednez\nGonz\u00e1lez, Fortin, and Lombardi 2019) and argued that quantum\ndecoherence does not solve the problem of isomerism (Fortin, Lombardi,\nand Mart\u00ednez Gonz\u00e1lez 2016). They also began to examine\nthe issue of the relationship between chemistry and quantum mechanics\nfrom a theoretical perspective, such as the Quantum Theory of Atoms in\nMolecules (Jaimes Arriaga, Fortin, and Lombardi 2019) and Bohmian\nmechanics (Fortin, Lombardi, and Mart\u00ednez Gonz\u00e1lez\n2017); this last paper was critically assessed by Giovanni Villani,\nElena Ghibaudi, and Luigi Cerruti (2018).\n As a continuation of her previous work in Spanish, Lombardi (2012)\noffered a critical analysis of Ilya Prigogine\u2019s proposals. In\nturn, with Luc\u00eda Lewowicz, she analyzed the ontological\ncategory of stuff as required by macro-chemistry (Lewowicz and\nLombardi 2013). The problem of the categories underlying the chemical\ndiscourse was also addressed in the context of the group by\nC\u00f3rdoba and Alfio Zambon (2017) for the particular case of\nnano-materials. A particular mention is needed to Zambon\u2019s\n(2018) completely new representation of the periodic system based on\natomic-number triads.\n\nGuillermo Restrepo focused his interest on how formal tools can be\napplied to chemistry. With Jos\u00e9 Luis Villaveces, he noted the\nresemblance between Leibniz\u2019s and Lavoisier\u2019s programs\nregarding a lingua philosophica for understanding nature\n(Restrepo and Villaveces 2011) and reviewed the origins of\nmathematical thinking in chemistry (Restrepo and Villaveces 2012).\nRestrepo also analyzed the mathematical aspects of the periodic law\n(Restrepo and Pach\u00f3n 2007) and considered the different\nfoundational aspects of the field called \u201cmathematical\nchemistry\u201d (2013; Restrepo and Villaveces 2013). Restrepo has\nbeen working in Germany since 2014 where he still produces interesting\ncontributions to the philosophy of chemistry.\n The development of the technological aspects of chemistry has been\nthe interest of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Chamizo (2013, 2017, 2019) with\napplications to chemistry education.\n4.3. Philosophy of Biology\n\nThe philosophy of biology in the region has been developed in various\ndirections from the most traditional topics in the area to more\ninnovative questions.\n\nThe traditional topic of natural selection is treated in relation to\nits explanatory power by Pablo Lorenzano in collaboration with the\nSpanish philosopher Jos\u00e9 D\u00edez (D\u00edez and Lorenzano\n2013, 2015). Santiago Ginnobili (2016) offers a metatheoretical\nstructuralist reconstruction of Darwin\u2019s theory with the purpose\nof elucidating the concept of ecological fitness, and Mario Casanueva\n(2011) proposes a structuralist reconstruction of the mechanism of\nnatural selection by means of graph resources. In turn, Gustavo Caponi\n(2013) studies the concepts of function, fitness, and adaptation in\nnatural selection theory.\n Closely related with natural selection, the issue of evolution is\napproached from very different perspectives. For instance, Guillemo\nFolguera stresses the dependence of macroevolution on microevolution\neven in the criticisms of the synthesis since the seventies (Folguera\nand Lombardi 2012), and Maurizio Esposito (2011) supplies examples of\nhow Darwinism was used and adapted in different contexts. But the most\nextensive work on this issue has been developed by Edna\nSu\u00e1rez-D\u00edaz who focused specifically on molecular\nevolution. In this field, she studied the role played by the concept\nof informational molecule and by the idea of molecular evolution of\ninformational molecules in differentiating molecular from classical\nevolutionists and in the constitution of genomics\n(Su\u00e1rez-D\u00edaz 2009, 2010). Despite stressing the\nimportance of the molecular experimental approach in evolutionary\nbiology (Su\u00e1rez-D\u00edaz and Barahona 1996),\nSu\u00e1rez-D\u00edaz acknowledges the methodological and\nconceptual difficulties embedded in the use of molecular evidence to\nelaborate molecular phylogenies (Su\u00e1rez-D\u00edaz and\nAnaya-Mu\u00f1oz 2008; Su\u00e1rez-D\u00edaz 2014a), and\nemphasizes the generative nature of experimentation\n(Su\u00e1rez-D\u00edaz 2013).\n Heredity, always linked with biological knowledge, has been the\ntopic of interest of Carlos L\u00f3pez-Beltr\u00e1n who shows the\ntransformation of the concept from playing a metaphorical role to\nacquire a narrative role (1994) and subsequently being conceived in\nstatistical terms (2006). By relating heredity with genetics, Esposito\n(2017) emphasizes the longstanding relationships between the\nreductionist view of gene as hereditary unit, the idea of information\nencoded in DNA, and the prophecies about the power of controlling\ngenetic information. From a structuralist perspective, Lorenzano\noffers a metatheoretical reconstruction of classical genetics (Balzer\nand Lorenzano 2000), paying special attention to the Hardy-Weinberg\nlaw within population genetics (2014).  Mario Casanueva (1997)\nexplores the relationship among the sexual theory of reproduction,\nMendelian genetics, and Mendel\u2019s hybridisation theory. In turn,\nJuan Manuel Torres (1997, 2002, 2006) focuses on the use of genetic\ntests in medical practice, and Anna Barahona (2007) considers how\ndifferent inheritance issues can be represented by genetic maps.\n Fabrizzio (now Siobhan) Guerrero Mc Manus examines methodological\nproblems: the rational selection of an algorithm for phylogenetic\ninference (2009), and the limitations of mechanistic explanations when\ndealing with developmental mechanisms (2012). In turn, the issue of\ncausation is treated by Maximiliano Mart\u00ednez in terms of the\nconcept of multi-level causation (Mart\u00ednez and Moya 2011;\nMart\u00ednez and Esposito 2014). The ideas of a multiplicity of\nlevels and of downward causation appears repeatedly in the works of\nCharbel El-Hani (El-Hani and Pereira 1999; El-Hani and Emmeche 2000;\nQueiroz and El-Hani 2006), with the purpose of advocating for property\nand process emergence in biology.\n In collaboration with El-Hani, Jo\u00e3o Queiroz has developed\nextensive work on the biosemiotic approach to biology (El-Hani,\nQueiroz, and Stjernfelt 2010; Queiroz, Emmeche, Kull, and El-Hani\n2011; Queiroz 2012; Queiroz, Stjernfelt, and El-Hani 2014), and its\nrelationship with genetic information (El-Hani, Queiroz, and Emmeche\n2006). From a completely different viewpoint,\nSu\u00e1rez-D\u00edaz (2007) discusses what she considers the\nmetaphor of information in molecular biology.\n\nOther non-classical but currently very relevant topics in life\nsciences are also treated in the region, such as environmental matters\n(Klier et al. 2017), ecology (Nunes-Neto, Moreno, and El-Hani 2014),\nand evo-devo (Baedke and Mc Manus 2018).\n Finally, it is worth mentioning a recent trend that, in the\nconfluence among philosophy, anthropology, and biology, considers\npolitical issues in biological research (Wade et al. 2015;\nGarc\u00eda-Deister and L\u00f3pez-Beltr\u00e1n 2015; Delgado\n2018), studies genomic variations in Latin America\n(Su\u00e1rez-D\u00edaz 2014b; Anaya-Mu\u00f1oz,\nGarc\u00eda-Deister, and Su\u00e1rez-D\u00edaz 2017), examines\nthe relationship among genetic research, nationalism, and the\nconstruction of collective social identities (Kent et al. 2015), and\nexplores the relationships among homosexuality, homophobia, and\nbiomedical sciences in the region (Mc Manus 2014).\n4.4. Philosophy of Formal Sciences\n\nSometimes very close to logic itself, the philosophy of logic has an\nimportant presence in Latin American philosophy of science from\nmultiple perspectives.\n\nThe logical treatment of contradiction attracted great interest,\nmainly in the groups of Campinas and Buenos Aires, although with\ndifferent motivations. In Campinas, where one underlying interest was\nthe possibility of modeling contradictory information in scientific\npractice, Newton da Costa focused on the mathematical concept of\n\u201cpragmatic truth\u201d (Mikenberg, da Costa, and Chuaqui 1986)\nwith the purpose of showing that the logic of pragmatic truth is\nparaconsistent (da Costa, Bueno, and French 1998). In turn, Walter\nCarnielli and Marcelo Coniglio developed an approach in which the\ndistinction between logic and philosophy is not straightforward. On\nthe philosophical side, and following the path opened by da Costa,\nthey focused on the so-called \u201clogics of formal\ninconsistency\u201d, a family of paraconsistent logics that can\nexpress the notion of consistency within the object language\n(Carnielli, Coniglio, and Marcos 2007). Carnielli also developed\ndialogical and epistemic approaches to paraconsistency (Rahman and\nCarnielli 2000; Carnielli and Rodrigues 2019).\n In the group led by Eduardo Barrio at Buenos Aires, works on\ninconsistency were motivated by semantic reasons, in particular, the\ntreatment of paradoxes (Barrio 2010; Picollo 2012; Barrio and Picollo\n2013). They studied non-transitivity as a solution of paradoxes\n(Barrio, Rosenblatt, and Tajer 2015; Barrio, Pailos, and Szmuc 2018),\nand considered non-traditional approaches to paradoxes (Da R\u00e9\nand Rosenblatt 2018). Some members of the group were also interested\nin classical recapture in the contexts of paraconsistent logic\n(Teijeiro forthcoming) and of logics of formal inconsistency (Tajer\nforthcoming). Recently, Barrio and collaborators have begun to focus\nspecifically on paraconsistency in its different aspects (Barrio,\nPailos, and Szmuc 2017, forthcoming a; Barrio and Da R\u00e9 2018b;\nBarrio, Clerbout, and Rahman forthcoming).\n\nThe strong contact between the groups of Campinas and Buenos Aires\nresulted in the publication of two special issues of the Logic\nJournal of the IGPL (Barrio and Carnielli forthcoming a,b)\ndevoted to logics of formal inconsistency. The interest in paradoxes\nand inconsistency also appeared in other authors of the region, such\nas Andr\u00e9s Bobenrieth (1998).\n Topics related to non-extensionality, in particular modal logics\nand Kripkean semantics, were also treated by some philosophers of\nlogic in Latin America (e.g., Mortari 2007; Marcos 2009; Estrada\nGonz\u00e1lez 2012; Rosenblatt and Szmuc 2014). In particular, Max\nFreund (2001, 2004, 2007, 2015) focused on modal logics with sortal\nquantifiers and wrote a collaborative book on modal logic\n(Cocchiarella and Freund 2008).\n The question of the coexistence of different logics was\nadditionally addressed by the groups in Buenos Aires and\nCampinas. Whereas Barrio and collaborators discussed logical pluralism\n(Barrio, Pailos, and Szmuc forthcoming b), Carnielli and Coniglio\nfocused on the problems of translations between logics (Carnielli,\nConiglio, and D\u2019Ottaviano 2009) and combinations of logics\n(Carnielli and Coniglio 2007 [2016]).\n More traditional problems related with truth have also been\ntreated by the philosophers of logic of the region (e.g., Barrio and\nRodr\u00edguez-Pereyra 2015; Barrio and Da R\u00e9 2018a). In\nparticular, Mario G\u00f3mez-Torrente (1998, 2000, 2002, 2008, 2006\n[2019]) developed a longstanding work on the notion of logical truth,\ntruth-preservation, and the relationships among logical truth,\nderivability, and model-theoretic validity.\n\nAlthough in the boundaries between logic and epistemology, the logic\nof belief revision and the works of Carlos Alchourr\u00f3n\n(Alchourr\u00f3n and Makinson 1981, 1982; Alchourr\u00f3n 1996)\ncannot be forgotten: the AGM model (Alchourr\u00f3n,\nG\u00e4rdenfors, and Makinson 1985) is still the dominant theory of\nbelief revision (see entry logic\nof belief revision in this Encyclopedia). Andr\u00e9s\nP\u00e1ez (2006) uses the theory of belief revision to supply a\nconcept of explanation embodied with pragmatic conditions. Closely\nrelated with this topic, \u201cdefeasible reasoning\u201d was\nextensively studied by Gustavo Bodanza and Fernando Tohm\u00e9\n(2005, 2009; Bodanza, Tohm\u00e9, and Simari 2016; Bodanza,\nTohm\u00e9, and Auday 2017; see also Bodanza 2002; Bodanza and\nAlessio 2017). Tohm\u00e9 also supplied a category-theoretic\nrepresentation of abduction (Tohm\u00e9, Caterina, and Gangle 2015),\nand analyzed abduction in its application to economy (Crespo,\nTohm\u00e9, and Heymann 2010; Tohm\u00e9 and Crespo\n2013). Abductive reasoning was also the main interest of Atocha\nAliseda (2003; Soler-Toscano, Nepomuceno-Fern\u00e1ndez, and\nAliseda-Llera 2009), who applied abduction to medical diagnosis\n(Aliseda and Leonides 2013) and proposed a conditional logic to\nformalize abduction (Beirlaen and Aliseda 2014). She also published a\nbook completely devoted to abduction (Aliseda 2006), which not only\ndiscusses conceptual and formal matters, but also pays special\nattention to the epistemic applications of abductive reasoning.\n4.5. Philosophy of Cognitive Sciences\n\nThe philosophy of cognitive sciences is a very complex field, mainly\ndue to the difficulty to distinguish it from other areas such as\nphilosophy of mind, epistemology, linguistics, philosophy of action,\nand logic.\n The traditional topic of consciousness has been treated in its\nrelation to brain functions from a naturalized perspective by\nJos\u00e9 Luis D\u00edaz (1995, 2000) and more recently by Miguel\nAngel Sebasti\u00e1n (2014) on the basis of the neurophysiology of\ndreams; in turn, Beatriz Sorrentino Marques and Osvaldo Pessoa (2017)\nanalyze the role of consciousness in agent causation theories.\nAnother traditional topic, perception, is addressed by Juan Carlos\nGonz\u00e1lez who analyzes the process of perceptual recalibration\n(Gonz\u00e1lez, Bach-y-Rita, and Haase 2005) and the case of\nhallucinations (Gonz\u00e1lez 2010, 2016), and by Laura Dan\u00f3n\nand Daniel Kalpokas (2017) who offer an explanation of the direct\nperception of mental states of others. Juan Pablo Berm\u00fadez, in\nturn, focuses on mental actions, supplying an account of skillful\naction that rejects both intellectualism and anti-intellectualism\n(2017) and claiming that remembering is not merely passive but must be\nviewed as a mental action (Arango-Mu\u00f1oz and Berm\u00fadez\n2018). In collaboration with Berm\u00fadez, Alejandro Rosas stresses\nthe cognitive and non-cognitive roots of shared intentionality (Rosas\nand Berm\u00fadez 2018) and the influence of cognitive dispositions\non weakness of will attribution (Rosas, Berm\u00fadez, and\nGuti\u00e9rrez 2018).\n\nIn addition to his collaborative work with Berm\u00fadez, Rosas\ndeveloped an extensive work on the evolution of moral cognition and\nthe cognitive roots of cooperation (2002, 2008a). In particular, he\nclaims that altruism is selected both at the individual and at the\ngroup levels (2008b) and proposes a unified theory of human\ncooperation based on reciprocity (2010, 2012). Recently, with\ncolleagues coming from philosophy and from science, he has contributed\nto the research on moral judgment with moral dilemmas (Rosas and\nKoenigs 2014; Rosas, Viciana, Caviedes, and Arciniegas 2019).\n An approach that received much attention in the region is that of\nembodied cognition and, in particular, enactivism (see Gonz\u00e1lez\n2013; Hutto and Satne 2017; Mart\u00ednez, Espa\u00f1ol, and\nP\u00e9rez 2018).  For instance, Ignacio Avila analyzes bodily\nawareness and its role in perceptual self-location (2014, 2017) and\nconsiders certain enactive accounts of perception (2015). Adrian\nCussins (2012) discusses the role that representation of the body\nplays in cognition. In turn, Maria Eunice Quilici Gonz\u00e1lez asks\nwhether embodied cognition can be applied to artificial systems as\nrobots (Haselager and Gonz\u00e1lez 2007a).\n\nAxel Barcel\u00f3 Aspeitia and Angeles Era\u00f1a focused their\nwork mainly on the modularity of mind in order to adapt the idea of\ndomain specificity (Barcel\u00f3, Era\u00f1a, and Stainton 2010)\nand to compare the hypothesis of massive modularity to other views\nabout the structure of mind (Era\u00f1a 2012). In this context,\nClaudia Lorena Garc\u00eda (2007) argues that the hypothesis of the\nmodularity of mind needs to be understood in terms of the evolutionary\nbiological concepts of variational independence (2007) and of\nfunctional homology and functional variation (2010).\n Metacognition is the topic that attracted the interest of Santiago\nArango-Mu\u00f1oz who distinguishes between the rationalizing level\nand the controlling level in metacognition (2011) and appeals to the\nconcepts of metamemory and metacognitive feelings to address the\ninteractions between the mind and the world (2013). Furthermore, he\nexplores the nature of the so-called \u201cepistemic feelings\u201d\nfrom a metacognitive perspective (2014, 2019).\n Cognitive functions are approached from an informational\nperspective by M.E.Q. Gonz\u00e1lez, who analyzes mechanical models\nof intelligence (2005) and of reasoning (Gonz\u00e1lez, Broens, and\nD\u2019Ottaviano 2007; Haselager and Gonz\u00e1lez 2007b). From the\nsame informational approach, Sebasti\u00e1n and Artiga (forthcoming)\nexplore metarepresentation. Other formal perspectives are adopted to\nverify the so-called cognitive task analysis (Laureano-Cruces and\nBarcel\u00f3-Aspeitia 2002) and to analyze the agent\u2019s\nresolution of conditional probability problems (Moro, Bodanza, and\nFreidin 2011).\n\nFrom a completely different viewpoint, several authors in the region\nprefer to understand cognitive phenomena in an analytical framework,\nspecifically in relation to language (e.g., Skidelsky 2013;\nGarc\u00eda-Ram\u00edrez 2011; Garc\u00eda-Ram\u00edrez and\nShatz 2011) with affinity with research in philosophy of mind.\n4.6. Philosophy of Social Sciences\n Certain methodological problems of social sciences have been\naddressed by Diego R\u00edos, who analyzed explanation with\nmechanistic and evolutionary models (2004; Kuchle and R\u00edos\n2015), and studied the relationship between methodological\nindividualism and methodological holism (R\u00edos 2005, 2009;\nR\u00edos Pozzi 2007). In particular, the autonomy and\nirreducibility of economics has been discussed (Scarano 2012;\nG\u00f3mez 2012). Nevertheless, almost all of the philosophy of\nsocial sciences in Latin America has been directed to theoretical\nissues in specific sciences or particular problems of the region.\n A field that attracts great interest is the philosophy of history.\nEl\u00edas Palti recalls the evolution and crisis of the area\n(2018), and distinguishes the so-called \u201cpolitico-intellectual\nhistory\u201d from the old \u201chistory of political ideas\u201d\n(2010, 2014). Veronica Tozzi (2012a, 2016, 2018), in turn, proposes an\noriginal pragmatist approach to the philosophy of history, which\nappeals to Dewey\u2019s notion of \u201cpractical meaning\u201d in\nrelation to the knowledge of the past. Tozzi also focuses on the\nproblem of the roles memory and testimony play in representing the\nrecent past (2009, 2012b). In connection to these concepts, Esteban\nLythgoe (2011, 2014) analyzes how Paul Ricoeur articulates history,\nmemory, and testimony.\n Other topics involved in the philosophy of history have also been\nconsidered: the historicity of the concept of subject (Palti 2004),\nthe ideas of progress (Ratto 2018), and of future (Belvedresi\n2018). In particular, Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s Mudrovcic highlights\nthe different types of consciousness of temporality (2014) and\nanalyzes the political self-understanding of the present in terms of\nthe past in contemporary Western societies (2013). The impact of the\nphenomenon of globalization on historiographical paradigms (Brauer\n2018) and on the deformation of ethical and political concepts\n(Rold\u00e1n 2018) are also examined. In turn, the idea of Global\nHistory is considered by Rosa Belvedresi (2012) who compares it with\nthe concept of universal history, and by Francisco Naishtat (2012) as\na framework for the Marxist debate on colonialism and\nmodernization.\n\nAt the crossroads between philosophy of politics and political\nphilosophy\u2014if there is any difference between them\u2014the\ncategories of equality and liberty (Hilb 1994), authority\n(Oyarz\u00fan 2012), and power (Oyarz\u00fan 2017) have been\nanalyzed. In this field, Naishtat has developed extensive research\nmainly directed to the critical evaluation of phenomena at the global\nscale. For instance, he analyzes the relationship between fragile\nsovereignties, global-intensive governance apparatuses, and a\nhorizon-less catastrophe-world (2010a), and argues that the political\ndimension of the global is global justice (2011). In turn, Naishtat\nstands in the context of recent political events, when he considers\nthe possibility of peace and rights transcending state frontiers in\nthe light of the 1990s Balkan wars (2000) and the\ndisplacement of the content of the terms \u201cterror\u201d and\n\u201cterrorism\u201d after 9/11 towards a meaning functional to\nglobalization (2010b).\n Latin American themes are recurrent in the philosophy of social\nsciences of the region. Palti has been very active in this field: he\nstudied the nineteenth century Latin American intellectual history in\nthe context of the thesis of the essential contestability of concepts\n(2005), considered the limitations of the notion of \u201cmisplaced\nideas\u201d by means of which Roberto Schwarz analyzed the dynamics\nof ideas in Latin America (2006), and critically examined the radical\ntransformation in the ways of conceiving the process leading to the\nbreak of colonial ties that linked Latin America with Spain\n(2009). Other authors share this interest in regional problems, such\nas Pablo Oyarz\u00fan (2007) who focused on Latin American\nsingularities, Gustavo Leyva (2014) who considered how the democratic\nproject was reformulated and radicalized in Latin America over the\nlast decades, and Ambrosio Velasco G\u00f3mez (2015) who proposes an\noriginal thesis about the intellectual roots of Mexican\nindependence.\n\nWhen Latin American themes are considered, the so-called Philosophy of\nLiberation cannot be forgotten: a philosophical movement that emerged\nin the late sixties in Argentina and spread through Latin America in\nthe following decades with authors such as Enrique Dussel, Leopoldo\nZea, Arturo Roig, Francisco Mir\u00f3 Quesada, Arturo Roig, and\nCarlos Cullen among many others. Nevertheless, here the topic will not\nbe treated because a complete entry of the Encyclopedia is devoted to\nit (Eduardo Mendieta,\n philosophy of liberation).\n4.7. Philosophy of Technology\n\nThe philosophy of technology has attracted significant interest from\nLatin American researchers working from very different perspectives\nwhether ontological-epistemological or ethical-political. From a\ngeneral viewpoint, Ricardo G\u00f3mez (2010) offers a detailed\noverview of the philosophical ideas about technology.\n Regarding the ontological status of technical artifacts and\nactions, Diego Lawler critically analyzes the functional and\nintentional theories about the nature of artifact kinks (Vega and\nLawler 2014) and proposes a praxeological approach to technological\npractices (Lawler 2018). In turn, Andr\u00e9s Vaccari directs\ncriticisms to the functionalist assumptions underlying the dual nature\nof technical artifacts program (2013) and the extended cognition\ntheory applied to artifacts (2017), claiming that transhumanism has\nfailed in its aim to ground the transformation of the human condition\non technology (2015). The ontological status of artificial agents and\nartificial life was addressed by Mari Gonz\u00e1lez and Osvaldo\nPessoa (2008), who face the problem of whether life and autonomy could\nin principle be sustained with components other than carbon, and by\nDiego Parente (2018) who considers the challenges that these cases\npose to the traditional dichotomy between natural/artificial. Pablo\nRodr\u00edguez and Javier Blanco (2017), in turn, confront Gilbert\nSimondon\u2019s theory of individuation with ideas coming from\ncybernetics. From an epistemological perspective Myriam Altamirano\nBustamante, Adalberto de Hoyos, and Le\u00f3n Oliv\u00e9 (2011)\nargue that much of the tacit knowledge involved in technology can be\ntransmitted as explicit knowledge through patents.\n\nThe ethical and socio-political dimensions of technology are topics\nthat have received great attention in the region. For instance, Jorge\nLinares Salgado (2018) analyzes the ethical and societal consequences\nof the production of bio-artifacts derived from synthetic biology. A\nmore specific study is offered by Carlos Osorio Marulanda (2018), who\naddresses the problems related with drinking water production,\nespecially in rural areas of Latin America, from the perspective of\nscience, technology, and society (STS) studies.\n\nIn the area of STS studies, the extensive work of Hebe Vessuri\noccupies a relevant place. In the boundaries between sociology and\nphilosophy, Vessuri has addressed general problems from a regional\npoint of view. For example, she considers how the current admission of\nthe underlying ontological complexity of the world influences both the\nsocio-cognitive and the institutional organization of disciplinary\nknowledge, particularly in developing countries (2000) and how\nscience and technology can respond to the particular needs of Latin\nAmerican societies (2003). Vessuri also discusses the world\ndistribution of scientists, engineers, and technologists and the\nmovement of these personnel from peripheral countries to central\ncountries (de la Vega and Vessuri 2008). The readers interested in STS\nstudies in Latin America can turn to the article \u201cLatin American\nscience, technology, and society. A historical and reflexive\napproach\u201d (Kreimer and Vessuri 2018), which describes the\ndevelopment of STS in the region, its institutionalization and its\nspaces of interaction.\n\nFinally, two books in Spanish by Le\u00f3n Oliv\u00e9 must be\nrecalled due to their impact in the Latin American community of\nphilosophers of science: whereas in the first (Oliv\u00e9 2000)\nscience and technology are considered on a par, the second book\n(Oliv\u00e9 2007) deals specifically with the different facets of\ntechnology.\n4.8. Other Topics\n\nOther topics, not easily included in the traditional philosophies of\nparticular sciences, have also been addressed in Latin America.\n What is now known as philosophy of information has been an\ninterest of Olimpia Lombardi and her research group from different\nperspectives. The meaning of the term \u201cinformation\u201d is\nelucidated from a general viewpoint (Lombardi 2004), paying particular\nattention to Shannon information (Lombardi 2005; Lombardi, Holik, and\nVanni 2016a), and arguing for a pluralistic interpretation of the\nconcept (Lombardi, Fortin, and Vanni 2015). By adopting a critical\nperspective regarding Christopher Timpson\u2019s deflationary view of\ninformation (Lombardi, Fortin, and L\u00f3pez 2016), it is argued\nthat there is no qualitative difference between Shannon and quantum\ninformation besides the difference in the way in which they are\nencoded (Lombardi, Holik, and Vanni 2016b). In turn, an\ninterpretational account of quantum measurement is offered (Lombardi,\nFortin, and L\u00f3pez 2015). On the basis of this critical work,\nLombardi and Cristian L\u00f3pez (2018) have elucidated the concept\nof information as used in Giulio Tononi\u2019s Integrated Information\nTheory of consciousness, and have proposed a manipulation-based\ninterpretation of communicational information (L\u00f3pez and\nLombardi 2019).\n The philosophy of science as a resource for science education is a\ntopic that has acquired an increasing interest in Latin America during\nthe last decades. In this field, two authors have developed intensive\nwork. Agust\u00edn Ad\u00fariz-Bravo addressed the use of\nwell-known episodes from the history of science, such as the\nformulation of the pendulum law by Galileo (2004) and the discovery of\nradium by the Curies (Ad\u00fariz-Bravo and Izquierdo-Aymerich 2009)\nfor science education. Moreover, he applied the cognitive model of\nscience (Izquierdo-Aymerich and Ad\u00fariz-Bravo 2003;\nAd\u00fariz-Bravo and Izquierdo-Aymerich 2005) and the semantic view\nof scientific theories (Ad\u00fariz-Bravo 2011, 2013) both to the\npractice of science teaching and to research on science education. He\nalso appealed to the so called \u201cNature of Science\u201d view of\nscience for the education of science teachers (Ad\u00fariz-Bravo\n2007, 2014). On the basis of those theoretical bases,\nAd\u00fariz-Bravo focuses on the philosophy of chemistry as a\nresource for the didactics of chemistry (Erduran, Ad\u00fariz-Bravo,\nand Mamlok Naaman 2007; Izquierdo-Aymerich and Ad\u00fariz-Bravo\n2009; Ad\u00fariz-Bravo, Merino, and Izquierdo-Aymerich 2012).\n The interest of Charbel El-Hani is mainly centered on the\nphilosophy of biology for didactics of biology. He advocates for a\ntheory-centered approach to the concept of life (2008) and considers\nthe advantages of the dialogue between the students\u2019\nethnobiological knowledge and biology school knowledge (Baptista and\nEl-Hani 2009). He also appeals to the works of Mendel and Darwin for\nteaching genetics and evolution (Bizzo and El-Hani 2009; El-Hani\n2015) and analyzes the different concepts of gene that often overlap\nin biology education (Dos Santos, Joaquim, and El-Hani 2012; Meyer,\nBomfim, and El-Hani 2013, Gericke, Hagberg, dos Santos, Joaquim, and\nEl-Hani 2014). Beyond the specific field of biology, El-Hani accounts\nfor the different ways in which individuals and societies represent\nconcepts (Aguiar Jr, Sevian, and El-Hani 2018), discusses how to deal\nwith the relations between different cultural perspectives in\nclassrooms (Moreira-dos-Santos and El-Hani 2017), and advocates for\nunderstanding as one of the major goals of science education\n(Ferreira, El-Hani, and da Silva Filho 2016).\n5. Concluding Remarks\n\nAfter reviewing the development of philosophy of science in Latin\nAmerica since its emergence in the mid-twentieth century, it can be\nsaid that there are some distinctive features in different countries.\nBut in the last decades, especially given the widespread use of the\nInternet and digital libraries by the mid-1990s, a growing\nintercommunication and collaboration can be verified as well as the\ntendency to form an academic community with an important international\npresence, which, at the same time, has certain characteristics of its\nown. Among the common features, the following deserve to be\nmentioned.\n\n In general, in Latin American countries, the philosophy of\nscience began to be cultivated in the mid-twentieth century in those\nacademic circles that were favorable to analytic philosophy,\nunderstood in a broad sense. The so-called \u201cphilosophical\nanalysis\u201d, more than a school or doctrinal body, represented in\nLatin America an alternative way of doing philosophy: in this trend,\nthe methodological demands of conceptual elucidation and argumentative\nrigor supported a reaction against the metaphysical, speculative, or\ndogmatic traditions that predominated in the 1940s. Thus, analytic\nphilosophy favored the focus on problems posed in the fields of logic,\nscience, and language (without restricting the analysis of the latter\nto ordinary language). Based on this common root, since the 1960s\nphilosophy of science has acquired a place of its own in most\ncountries of the region.\n Although the \u201cAmericanist\u201d concern (understood as the\nsearch for a philosophy of the region, with its own identity) did not\nprevail in philosophy of science of Latin America, the constant and\ngrowing exchange between Latin American philosophers of science has\nhad the result of generating lines of research that integrate the\nconcerns for the social problems afflicting the countries of the\nregion and the role that science and technology can play in its\nsolution. Thus, from the 1990s, a triple movement was generated:\norientation towards practical issues, openness to other philosophical\ntraditions\u2014different from the analytic tradition\u2014and a\ndirect connection between the main Latin American nuclei where\nphilosophy of science is developed.\n At the turn of the century, a vigorous growth of the \nphilosophy of particular sciences can be observed, especially the\nphilosophy of physics and biology, and more recently the philosophy of\ncognitive sciences. The philosophy of chemistry\u2014a field that had\nbeen ignored all over the world until 1980\u2014has only recently\nbegun to be cultivated in countries such as Argentina and Mexico. In\ncontrast, in philosophy of the social sciences, Latin America shows an\nunequal growth compared to the philosophy of the natural sciences.\nDespite this, it can be said that a sustained effort is being made to\npromote areas such as the philosophy of psychology, sociology, and\neconomics. Furthermore, the philosophy of formal sciences has advanced\nsignificantly.\n Regarding philosophy of technology, it received very little\nattention until the end of the last century. However, the frequent\ninteraction with the Spanish philosophers of technology, through their\nparticipation in specialized meetings and their collaboration in\ngraduate programs, has favored the cultivation of this research axis\nin close connection with the critical reflection on the relationships\nbetween technology and the economic, social, and environmental\nproblems afflicting the region.\n Regarding general philosophy of science, its development shows a\nremarkable diversification in Latin America. In a relatively short\nperiod of time\u2014which started in the late 1980s\u2014there has\nbeen a growing expansion of problems, approaches, and lines of\nresearch. Even the discussion of great classical problems, such as\nrationality and realism, is carried out from alternative perspectives,\nmany of which have recovered the naturalist approach of classical\npragmatists, which in the 1960s gained a new impetus under the\nso-called \u201cHistoricist turn\u201d. On the other hand, this\nstrong tendency to develop a naturalized philosophy of science has\nbeen accompanied by the defense of markedly pluralist positions, both\nin the methodological as well as the epistemological and ontological\nfields. All of this points to a conception of philosophical work that,\nwithout neglecting argumentative rigor and conceptual elucidation,\ndeals with and worries about the problems of its context and\nhistorical moment. In the philosophy of science, this has been\nreflected in a growing awareness of the need to rethink the\nrelationships among science, technology, and society, along with its\nethical, political, economic, environmental, and gender\ndimensions.\n By way of conclusion, it should be noted that, in contrast to the\nway in which philosophy of science has developed in the Anglo-Saxon\nsphere, works in Latin America have moved much more rapidly from the\nmerely \u201cacademic\u201d stage, where discussions revolve around\nwhat other colleagues (classical or contemporary) have proposed, to\nthe stage of critical reflection on the problems of broader social\nenvironment in which scientific activity takes place. However, it\nshould also be noted that this expansion of horizons has not affected\nnegatively the research on the central problems of the discipline\n(logical, semantic, methodological, pragmatic, epistemological, and\nontological) which continue to be the core of the curriculum of the\nspecialized degree programs, as well as of the research centers where\nphilosophy of science is developed.\n\n\nFinally, it is worth stressing that the area strongly progressed in\nspite of the many obstacles that philosophical research faces in the\nregion; the erratic political situation and the cyclic economic crisis\nin Latin American countries influence research policies, and this\nplaces scholars in unstable and uncertain positions.  Nevertheless,\nregardless of the difficulties, at present a new generation of young\nphilosophers of science allows us to foresee that the philosophy of\nscience produced in Latin America will continue to grow in quantity\nand quality, increasing its already considerable international\npresence.",
