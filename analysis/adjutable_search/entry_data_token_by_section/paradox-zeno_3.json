    "main_text": "The Paradoxes of Plurality || The Argument from Complete Divisibility\n2.3 The Argument from Complete Divisibility\n\n\u2026 whenever a body is by nature divisible through and through,\nwhether by bisection, or generally by any method whatever, nothing\nimpossible will have resulted if it has actually been divided\n\u2026\u00a0 though perhaps nobody in fact could so divide it.\n\n\nWhat then will remain? A magnitude? No: that is impossible, since then\nthere will be something not divided, whereas ex hypothesi the\nbody was divisible through and through. But if it be admitted\nthat neither a body nor a magnitude will remain \u2026 the body will\neither consist of points (and its constituents will be\nwithout magnitude) or it will be absolutely nothing. If the\nlatter, then it might both come-to-be out of nothing and exist as a\ncomposite of nothing; and thus presumably the whole body will be\nnothing but an appearance. But if it consists of points, it will not\npossess any magnitude. (Aristotle On Generation and\nCorruption, 316a19)\n\n\nThese words are Aristotle\u2019s not Zeno\u2019s, and indeed the\nargument is not even attributed to Zeno by Aristotle. However we have\nSimplicius\u2019 opinion ((a) On Aristotle\u2019s Physics,\n139.24) that it originates with Zeno, which is why it is included\nhere. Aristotle begins by hypothesizing that some body is completely\ndivisible, \u2018through and through\u2019; the second step of the\nargument makes clear that he means by this that it is divisible into\nparts that themselves have no size\u2014parts with any magnitude\nremain incompletely divided. (Once again what matters is that the body\nis genuinely composed of such parts, not that anyone has the time and\ntools to make the division; and remembering from the previous section\nthat one does not obtain such parts by repeatedly dividing all parts\nin half.) So suppose the body is divided into its dimensionless parts.\nThese parts could either be nothing at all\u2014as Zeno argued\nabove\u2014or \u2018point-parts\u2019. If the parts are nothing\nthen so is the body: it\u2019s just an illusion. And, the argument\nconcludes, even if they are points, since these are unextended the\nbody itself will be unextended: surely any sum\u2014even an infinite\none\u2014of zeroes is zero.\n\nCould that final assumption be questioned? It is (as noted above) a\nconsequence of the Cauchy definition of an infinite sum; however\nGr\u00fcnbaum (1967) pointed out that that definition only applies to\ncountable sums, and Cantor gave a beautiful, astounding and extremely\ninfluential \u2018diagonal\u2019 proof that the number of points in\nthe segment is uncountably infinite. There is no way to label\nall the points in the line with the infinity of numbers 1, 2,\n3, \u2026\u00a0, and so there are more points in a line segment than\nsummands in a Cauchy sum. In short, the analysis employed for\ncountably infinite division does not apply here.\n\nSo suppose that you are just given the number of points in a line and\nthat their lengths are all zero; how would you determine the length?\nDo we need a new definition, one that extends Cauchy\u2019s to\nuncountably infinite sums? It turns out that that would not help,\nbecause Cauchy further showed that any segment, of any length\nwhatsoever (and indeed an entire infinite line) have exactly the\nsame number of points as our unit segment. So knowing the number\nof points won\u2019t determine the length of the line, and so nothing\nlike familiar addition\u2014in which the whole is determined by the\nparts\u2014is possible. Instead we must think of the distance\nproperties of a line as logically posterior to its point composition:\nfirst we have a set of points (ordered in a certain way, so\nthat there is some fact, for example, about which of any three is\nbetween the others) then we define a function of pairs of\npoints which specifies how far apart they are (satisfying such\nconditions as that the distance between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) plus\nthe distance between \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) equals the distance\nbetween \\(A\\) and \\(C\\)\u2014if \\(B\\) is between\n\\(A\\) and \\(C)\\). Thus we answer Zeno as follows: the\nargument assumed that the size of the body was a sum of the sizes of\npoint parts, but that is not the case; according to modern\nmathematics, a geometric line segment is an uncountable infinity of\npoints plus a distance function. (Note that Gr\u00fcnbaum used the\nfact that the point composition fails to determine a length to support\nhis \u2018conventionalist\u2019 view that a line has no determinate\nlength at all, independent of a standard of measurement.)\n\nAs Ehrlich (2014) emphasizes, we could even stipulate that an\n\u2018uncountable sum\u2019 of zeroes is zero, because the length of\na line is not equal to the sum of the lengths of the points it\ncontains (addressing Sherry\u2019s, 1988, concern that refusing to\nextend the definition would be ad hoc). Hence, if one stipulates that\nthe length of a line is the sum of any complete collection of proper\nparts, then it follows that points are not properly speaking\nparts of a line (unlike halves, quarters, and so on of a line).\nIn a strict sense in modern measure theory (which generalizes\nGr\u00fcnbaum\u2019s framework), the points in a line are\nincommensurable with it, and the very set-up given by Aristotle in\nwhich the length of the whole is analyzed in terms of its points is\nillegitimate. \n",
