Geneticists routinely\nidentified genes based on phenotypic differences in hybridization\nexperiments or the analysis of pedigrees (see\n \u00a71.2).\n Differences between, first germ cells, and, later, more specifically,\nbetween chromosomes, had to be assumed to explain patterns of\nphenotypic correlation between sexually reproducing organisms and\ntheir offspring. These units of difference in the genetic material\ncould also, and more importantly, be used to predict phenotypes. For\nthese purposes, it was not necessary to know what exactly their\nphysical location or material composition was. In this sense, the\nconcept was instrumental. In a similar way, Lenny Moss (2003: Ch. 1)\ncharacterizes the gene-P as a gene defined by its phenotypic effect\nand used for prediction (the \u201cP\u201d can thus stand for\n\u201cphenotype\u201d or \u201cprediction\u201d, but Moss also\npoints out that the concept is associated with instrumental\npreformationism).\n\nOnce the tools of molecular genetics were in place, for each case the\ngenetic difference correlated with the phenotypic difference could be\nlocated in the DNA and hence the genes of classical genetics could be\nmolecularized (Waters 1994). The instrumental gene (as a unit that\ncorrelates with a phenotypic difference, segregates in a Mendelian\nmanner, and is subject to recombination events) can remain\nindeterminate regarding DNA-sequence and need not correspond to a gene\nthat has an identifiable product. In many cases one of the genetic\nvariants consists in the absence or lack of a function of a gene\nproduct and there are many ways in which a change in DNA can result in\nthe lack of a resource (Moss 2003: Ch. 1). The instrumental gene can\ncorrespond to elements of various size, including whole chromosome\naberrations, and they might be located in coding regions as much as in\nregulatory elements or even insulator regions that only function to\nseparate other functional elements, as long as a difference in\u00a0\nthe sequence is correlated with a phenotypic effect (Griffiths &\nStotz 2006).\n\nThe concept of the gene analyzed in terms of instrumental genes, or\ngenes-P, is still widely used in many contexts such as evolutionary\nbiology, agricultural breeding, or medicine (even though it might play\nout differently in the identification of genetic traits and in\nevolutionary theory, respectively; see Gifford 2000; S. Gilbert 2000).\nThe instrumental gene thus exists along-side other gene concepts which\nemphasize the material basis and immediate biochemical roles of\ngenes.\n\nMolecular genetics gave rise to what has been called the\n\u201cclassical molecular gene\u201d concept (Neumann-Held 1999, see\n \u00a7\u00a71.3\u20131.4).\n The classical molecular gene was characterized both structurally and\nfunctionally in the following way: A gene exhibits a certain structure\nknown as an \u201copen reading frame\u201d (ORF), that is, a\nsequence of codons between and including a start and a stop codon,\nwhich initiate and terminate translation respectively (i.e., they\nexhibit their function in the transcribed RNA, but can be identified\nin the corresponding DNA). Also, transcription and translation\ninitiation and determination signals, such as transcription factor\nbinding sites and other regulatory elements typically associated with\nprotein-coding genes were often seen as part of the molecular gene\n(forming a \u201ctranscription unit\u201d). The function of such a\nmolecularly described gene was to give rise (via mRNA) to a\npolypeptide chain as the basis of a functional protein through the\nprocesses of transcription and translation. The gene fulfilled this\nfunction by acting as a template. Complications such as splicing or\noverlapping genes were initially not seen as compromising the\nstructural-functional unity of the material gene. Non-coding,\nfunctional RNA could also be assimilated to the concept, if it was\npossible to identify a stretch of DNA based on linear correspondence\nbetween the product and its gene (Griffiths & Stotz 2006).\n\nIn the molecular realm, yet another gene concept, gene-D, can be\nidentified, which is characterized in contrast to the gene-P and\ncaptures a situation in which researchers identify genes as\ndevelopmental resources (Moss 2003: Ch. 1). Genes-D are typically\nclassical molecular genes, but here the emphasis is on function rather\nthan structure and especially on function beyond the initial role as\ntemplate. As pointed out by Weber (2005: Ch. 7), researchers\u2019\nattention is often initially guided towards a part of DNA sequence\nconceptualized as gene-P, that is, as associated with phenotypic\nvariation. Once the relevant gene is cloned and the regulatory\nnetworks in which it is involved as well as the activities of its\nproduct are investigated, it frequently becomes clear that it is\nexpressed in many tissues, in different contexts and at different\ntimes (see\n \u00a71.4).\n Furthermore, the locus in question often functions as template for a\nlarge variety of products. Hence, while the gene-P is indeterminate\nwith respect to sequence, the gene-D is indeterminate with respect to\nphenotype. Addressing a gene as gene-D means to investigate its\nvarious roles in the process of epigenesis. The fact that the absence\nof one or several of these products leads to phenotypic change does\nnot imply that the resource is more important in the development of\nthe structure exhibiting the phenotype than the large number of other\ngenes involved and their respective products. Instead, the phenotype\nshows how the developmental process responds to the absence of a\nresource. The fallacious notion of genes for a certain trait (e.g.,\nblue eyes) containing developmental information (e.g., for making blue\neyes) results when biologists (or commentators) conflate the separate\nnotions that genes-D contain template information and that genes-P\ncontain predictive information (Moss 2003: Ch. 1 and 2). While\n\u201cgene for\u201d talk is misleading in the context of\ndevelopment (Kampourakis 2017), the notion has been defended in the\ncontext of evolution (Kaplan & Pigliucci 2001).\n\nThe classical molecular gene concept was closely related to the\nnotions of genetic information and the genetic code (see\n \u00a71.3\n and entry on\n biological information).\n While some philosophers have described these terms as potentially\nmisleading metaphors (Sarkar 1996), many see these concepts either as\nused in a literal sense and hence justified (Godfrey-Smith 2000), or\nas metaphorical, but productive (Levy 2011). The details of an\nadequate explication are much debated (e.g., Stegmann 2005), but on\nthe level of molecular phenotypes (mainly proteins) the information\nconcept is seen as relatively uncontroversial. More debated is the\nquestion if information, or the notion of causal specificity that it\nimplies, is a unique property of DNA or if it applies to other\ncellular and extra-cellular components as well (Baxter 2019; Bourrat\n2020; Griffiths & Stotz 2013: Ch. 4\u20136; Griffiths et al.\n2015; Waters 2007; Weber 2017; Woodward 2010). On the level of whole\norganism phenotypes, genetic information has been explicated in terms\nof teleosemantic theories borrowed from philosophy of mind and\nemphasizing the selected function of genes (Maynard Smith 2000;\nSterelny et al. 1996). The parity thesis, stating that non-genetic\nfactors can carry information in the same sense has been suggested on\nthis level as well (Griffiths 2001). Other philosophers have discussed\nthe question of whether selected function would not be better located\non the level of the developing organism as the receiver of information\n(Jablonka 2002) or if a notion of genetic representation can be\nreformulated in terms of transmission in an intergenerational\ninformation producer and consumer system (Shea 2013; cf. K\u00f5iv\n2020; Planer 2016).\n\nFrom a broader perspective, it has been argued that information talk\nin genetics results in the persistence of genetic determinism (Oyama\n[1985] 2000). The latter notion expresses the idea that an organism\nwill exhibit a trait if it carries certain alleles, where the role of\nthe environment is reduced to permitting this potential to unfold (see\nentries on\n heritability\n and\n the distinction between innate and acquired characteristics).\n The question is if the influence of genes and environment can be\nseparated, especially when considering the often non-additive\ncharacter of genotype-environment interactions (Gray 1992; Griffiths\n2006; Kitcher 2001). These issues are most controversial and have\nreceived most attention regarding the question to what extent human\nbehaviors or cognitive capabilities can be described as genetically\ndetermined (Esposito 2017; Keller 2010; Longino 2013; Schaffner 2016;\nTabery 2014; Turkheimer 2019). Interestingly, the new science of\nmolecular epigenetics is often framed in a deterministic language as\nwell (see\n \u00a71.5;\n Meloni 2016; Richardson 2017; Waggoner & Uller 2015).\n2.3.2 The molecular and the post-genomic gene\n\nMolecular biology is not interested merely in the physical\ncharacterization of molecules; it aims to assign biological roles to\nmolecules, that is, functions in highly specialized, directively\norganized systems (Waters 2000). However, it becomes increasingly\nquestionable if molecules identified as developmental resources or\nfunctional parts of cellular mechanisms can be identified in a\ncoherent manner as genes or gene products. The classical molecular\ngene concept has been undermined by the accumulation of insights about\nthe complexities of regulation and post-transcriptional processing of\nRNA (see\n \u00a7\u00a71.4\u20131.5;\n Fogle 2000; Portin 2002). A more flexible gene concept has since\nemerged, which analysts have dubbed the \u201cpost-genomic\ngene\u201d (Griffiths & Stotz 2006). In an influential article,\nresearchers associated with the ENCODE project suggested the following\ndefinition:\n\n\nThe gene is a union of genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of\npotentially overlapping functional products. (Gerstein et al. 2007:\n677)\n\n\nIn this view, several molecular products are the starting point from\nwhich elements in the genome are identified giving rise to this set of\nproducts (regulatory regions not included).\n\nThe post-genomic gene thus not only adds to the plurality of gene\nconcepts, but it is also inherently pluralistic. Many new cellular\nprocesses have been discovered and found to be ubiquitous, such as\nframeshifting, antisense DNA transcription, alternative and\ntrans-splicing, RNA editing, as well as an abundance of regulatory\nelements in DNA, and of DNA regions transcribed to non-coding, but\nfunctional RNA. This has created a situation in which no single or\nsimple set of criteria can be formulated for when a sequence of DNA\ncounts as a gene. While the classical molecular gene seemed to\nreestablish a one-one relation of genes and phenotypes on the\nmolecular level (one gene \u2013 one polypeptide), the processes just\nmentioned can result in a situation where one gene identified through\nan ORF gives rise to various gene products (molecular phenotypes). One\ncan thus speak of \u201cmolecular pleiotropy\u201d (Burian 2004).\nAdditionally, a given product might be synthesized from various genes\n(ORFs). Accordingly, a given stretch of DNA can belong to several\ngenes identified more broadly as set of template resources for a\nproduct. Furthermore, the nature of these processes implies that the\nmolecular phenotype is not determined by the DNA sequence but depends\non a distributed and context-dependent interaction of many cellular\nand, ultimately, extracellular factors. Hence one can also speak of\n\u201cmolecular epigenesis\u201d in this respect (Burian 2004).\n\nAgain, however, it seems that just as the molecular gene concept has\nnot replaced the instrumental gene concept, the new, post-genomic\nconcept has not replaced the molecular gene concept. Indeed, empirical\nresearch shows that groups that identify with different subfields of\nbiology prefer different gene concepts (Stotz et al. 2004). Referring\nto genes as more or less straightforward representations of gene\nproducts in DNA sequence plays an important role in many contexts, and\nfor coordinating research and integrating results from various fields.\nGene annotation, for instance, which is necessary to make genome\nsequences in databases accessible in a useful way, depends on\nidentifying genes in a canonical manner (Baetu 2012a; see\n \u00a71.5).\n The persisting classical molecular gene concept can be referred to as\nthe \u201cconsensus\u201d or \u201cnominal gene\u201d (Burian\n2004; Fogle 2000; Griffiths & Stotz 2006). The post-genomic gene\nconcept, instead, has been proposed to capture situations where\nresearchers focus on the complexities of regulation, transcription,\nand translation, and conceptualize genes as template resources used in\nvarious ways in cellular processes (Griffiths & Stotz 2006). Even\nin cases of complex transcription, however, the identification of\ngenes tends to be guided by the consensus gene concept. As opposed to\nthe instrumental and the nominal molecular gene, the post-genomic gene\ndoes not entail a prescription as to how to identify a gene. In some\nsense, the focus shifts more to function (the product), but at the\nsame time this new concept de-emphasizes the gene as a unit and\nfacilitates the study of the whole genome as a set of complexly\nstructured DNA molecules (Barnes & Dupr\u00e9 2008; Falk\n2010).\n\nBecause of its focus on structure and the resulting usefulness for\nannotation practices in bioinformatics, the nominal gene remains the\nunit of analysis in comparative genomics (see\n \u00a71.5).\n In these contexts, claims about similarity in terms of nominal\nmolecular genes are often translated into claims of similarity more\nbroadly construed, based on the assumption that homologous genes yield\nhomologous products and hence are involved in homologous functions.\nSuch claims are, however, often not warranted given the complexity of\ngene expression (Piotrowska 2009). On the other hand, much of genomic\nresearch seems not to be committed to any specific gene concept.\nStatistical techniques of bioinformatic sequence comparison function\nas discovery tools that detect relations between genome sequences,\ntranscripts, and proteins or between sequences on any level among\nvarious species (Perini 2011). They can suggest candidate genes,\nindicate events of post-transcriptional processing, or point to\nprocesses of genome evolution (see\n \u00a7\u00a71.4\u20131.5).\n Researchers in genomics (involving sequence annotation tasks), seem\nto respond to the complexities of regulation and post-transcriptional\nprocessing by operating with an extended structural characterization\n(\u201csyntax-based\u201d, in the parlance of bioinformatics-driven\nresearch) of genes and other genome elements, rather than emphasizing\nthe ad hoc identification of genes from the perspective of\nproducts captured by the post-genomic gene concept (Baetu 2011,\n2012a). A sequence thus characterized can still give rise to a variety\nof products, but their processing depends on splicing signals and\nsimilar sequence features that can be identified on a structural\nlevel. In this view, genes appear \u201cas modular sets of\ninstructions for the genome expression machinery of the cell\u201d\n(Baetu 2011: 718).\n\nIn terms of development, the genome has been described not only as a\nresource, but also as reactive to the cellular context rather than as\ndirecting cellular processes (S. Gilbert 2003; Griffiths & Stotz\n2013: Ch. 4; Keller 2014). The genome is always embedded in a cellular\nenvironment (also virus genomes become reactive in the context of\ntheir host\u2019s cells), and cellular processes mediate between the\norganismal or extra-organismal environment and the genome. The\npost-genomic gene concept is thus open to integrate molecular\nepigenetic processes that turn environmental cues into regulatory\nsignals. Molecular epigenetics has also been discussed as a pathway of\ninheritance, alternative to DNA transmission and more responsive to\nenvironmental changes (Jablonka & Raz 2009; entry on\n inheritance systems).\n Emerging knowledge of these processes re-shapes explanations in\nheredity, development, and evolution and hence shifts the explanatory\nstatus of gene concepts (Baedke 2018; Griesemer 2011; Griffiths &\nStotz 2013, Ch. 5; Le Goff et al. 2021; Stotz & Griffiths 2016).\nFurthermore, next to the complexity of the regulation and genesis of\nmolecular products, also the interaction of products as studied in\nsystems biology displays a complexity that makes it difficult to\nascribe functional roles to genes (see entry on\n philosophy of systems and synthetic biology;\n see\n \u00a71.5).\n If genes are deleted from the genome experimentally (\u201cgene\nknock-out\u201d), this often does not have the expected effect on\ndevelopmental processes, because the encoded molecules are part of\nlarge interaction networks that can exhibit a high degree of\nrobustness and redundancy (Mitchell 2009: Ch. 4; Morange 2001: Ch. 5).\nThe stochasticity of gene expression and molecular interactions\nemerges as another aspect complicating the role of genes and gene\nproducts in cellular processes (Casali & Merlin 2020; Kupiec 2014;\nMorange 2011; Nicholson 2019).\n\nIn the light of these developments, one might say that the\npost-genomic gene was disassociated from the notion of a\n\u201cgenetic program\u201d, which was criticized as embodying a\npreformationist view of development (Keller 2000; Moss 1992; Robert\n2004; entry on \n theories of biological development). \n Some have argued,\nhowever, that the concept is still important for reasoning about\nregulatory mechanisms, highlighting roles and organizational features\nof genomic elements without excluding others (Baetu 2012b; Calcott\n2020). Nonetheless, it appears that post-genomic explanations are\nrather articulated in terms of signaling, regulatory, or interaction\nnetworks than programs (Calcott 2014; Huneman 2019; Planer 2014). Even\nthough genes do not constitute a blueprint of the organism (Pigliucci\n2010), DNA and its functional elements provide a form of stability\nnecessary for epigenetic processes to yield robust outcomes (De\nTi\u00e8ge et al. 2015; Meunier & Reynaud 2017; Vecchi\n2020).\n\nSuggestions have been made to use the term \u201cgene\u201d to refer\nto the whole process that yields the functional product (the\n\u201cprocess molecular gene\u201d concept, Neumann-Held 1999). But\napart from the fact that it is difficult to delineate the boundaries\nof such a process, this seems to be too distant from the ways\nresearchers use the term. Biologists and philosophers have suggested\nalternative terminologies for DNA sequences that are meant to replace\nor complement the problematic term gene, for instance, regarding\ngenome evolution (Brosius & Gould 1992), regulation (Scherrer\n& Jost 2007), and from an integrative systems perspective (Keller\n& Harel 2007). While some of these interventions seem to suggest\nthat the gene concept has become redundant, biologists have emphasized\nits explanatory value when seen in the right context, in particular,\nas a cellular component (Hall 2001). It might be the case that this\ncomponent of cells has received undue attention to the expense of\nothers, but it must also be noted that genes (or DNA) are often in\nfocus because they can be most easily intervened on, while these\ninterventions can then also be informative about other components of\ncellular processes (Gannett 1999; Waters 2008). Similarly, in the\npractical contexts of synthetic biology, genes can often successfully\nbe constructed, conceptually and materially, as causal agents (Oftedal\n& Parkkinen 2013). More generally, it has been suggested that the\ngene concept is useful exactly because of its overall vagueness,\nbecause it can be adjusted to specific epistemic needs within newly\nemerging fields and at the same time facilitate connections between\ndisparate areas of research (Rheinberger & M\u00fcller-Wille\n2018).\n3. Conclusion\n\nIt became clear that discussions in philosophy of biology are driven\nby developments in biology. At the same time, it appears that there is\nno end to scientific innovation in biology. New technologies open new\nwindows into biological domains, make new phenomena accessible, or\nshed a different light on known entities and processes. These\ndevelopments and the ensuing theoretical shifts and conceptual\ntransformations will require a type of conceptual reflection and\nclarification for which philosophy of science has developed an\nindispensable set of tools (Pradeu et al. forthcoming).",
