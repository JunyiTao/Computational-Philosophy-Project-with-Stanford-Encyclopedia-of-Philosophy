    "main_text": "Incommensurability of Thought Styles and the Problem of Truth\n9. Reception\n\nBefore World War II there appeared nineteen reviews of Fleck\u2019s\nbook on the genesis and development of a scientific fact, most of them\npositive; yet only one was published in a philosophical journal, and\nthe rest were published in medical or popular journals and newspapers.\nAfter WWII Fleck\u2019s epistemology, in spite of all his efforts,\nwas completely forgotten. Thomas S. Kuhn mentioned his book in the\nPreface to The Structure of Scientific Revolutions as\n\u201can essay that anticipated many of my own ideas\u201d (Kuhn\n1962, p. VII); but for at least fifteen years during fierce debates\nprovoked by Kuhn\u2019s book, nobody paid attention to this remark.\nIt was only a paper by Wilhelm Baldamus (1977) and a book by his\nstudent Thomas Schnelle (1982) that awakened a broader interest in\nFleck\u2019s philosophy and sociology of science. Fleck\u2019s book\nwas republished in the German language in 1980. In 1979 its English\ntranslation Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact\nappeared; and between 1986 and 1990 most of Fleck\u2019s\nepistemological papers became available in English. Fleck\u2019s book\nand articles was translated into Italian, Polish, Spain, Swedish,\nRussian, Ukrainian, Korean, French and Brazilian Portuguese.\n\nToday, in the English speaking world, Fleck is mostly considered to be\nan unappreciated forerunner of Thomas Kuhn\u2019s theory of\nscientific revolutions. It is in the German speaking community of\nphilosophers and sociologists of science that Fleck is considered to\nbe a highly original epistemologist, who presents human knowledge in a\nquite peculiar and explorative way which significantly transcends\nKuhn\u2019s theses. In France there is a group of philosophers and\nhistorians of medicine\u2014Ilana L\u00f6wy and others\u2014who\napply Fleck\u2019s ideas in their research. In his famous\nintroduction to the actor-network theory, Bruno Latour named Fleck\n\u201cthe founder of sociology of science\u201d (Latour 2005, p.\n112). In 2005 Ludwik Fleck Zentrum was founded in Collegium\nHelveticum, Z\u00fcrich, led by Johannes Fehr until 2014; since 2015\nthe centre is managed by Hartmut von Sass. In Brazil Ludwik Fleck has\ninfluenced at least three different \u201cthought collectives\u201d:\nhis theory is applied by historians of science, in teaching and\nlearning science, and in philosophy (Cond\u00e9 2016). There is a\ngroup of Serbian archaeologists who are inspired in their work by\nFleck\u2019s epistemology (Milosavljevi\u0107 2016).\n",
