    "main_text": "The Epistemology of the Republic: The Two Worlds Doctrine\n12. The Epistemology of the Republic: The Two Worlds Doctrine\n\n\nThe Republic is unquestionably Plato's most elaborate\ndefense of his central ethical doctrines in the middle period. It\nexplores the question what is Justice over the course of ten books,\nwith the aim of demonstrating that the best life for a human is the\nlife devoted to virtue and knowledge, for such a life will result in\nhappiness for the individual. The virtuous person will be one who has\nall three parts of her soul working in a harmonious fashion, i.e., her\nreason, cognizant of the Form of the Good and the other Forms, will\nwith the support and consent of her appetite and spirit govern all of\nher pursuits. The analogue of the virtuous individual with her\ntripartite soul is the ideal state, the Republic, with its three parts\nor classes, rulers, warriors and laborers, all working in harmony with\none another under the auspices of the ruler, i.e., reason. Having\nestablished that justice is psychic harmony at the end of Book Four,\nPlato next turns to show what it is that the philosopher ruler (or\nreason in the individual) knows that licenses his claim that they will\nrule for the benefit of the respective parts and the whole state or\nperson\n\n\nAt the end of Book V (474bff), Socrates begins his defense of the\nrule of the philosopher by contrasting his epistemological condition\nwith that of a group of sightlovers. The philosopher, who accepts that\nthere are Forms, e.g., Beauty Itself, has knowledge. The sightlover,\nwho denies that there is Beauty Itself but rather insists that there\nare just the many (different) beautiful plays, paintings and such,\nlacks knowledge. He has only belief. In support of this contention,\nSocrates distinguishes three different kinds of mental states or\ncapacities and three generic \u2018objects\u2019 for these\ncapacities. Knowledge is set over \u2018what completely is\u2019;\nignorance is set over \u2018what completely is not\u2019; and,\nbelief, being intermediate between knowledge and ignorance, is set over\nwhat is intermediate between the other two generic objects, namely\n\u2018what is and is not\u2019. Capacities are distinguished,\nSocrates contends, by two criteria: 1) difference in objects; and 2)\ndifference in what they do (with/to their objects). Examples of 1)\ninclude colors and sounds, and of course what completely is and what is\nand is not. The second criterion is seemingly satisfied by the\ndifference between being true versus being true and false. Thus,\nknowledge is always true, whereas belief admits of both truth and\nfalsehood.\n\n\nMuch turns on how one understands the \u2018is\u2019 (es)\nof \u2018what completely is\u2019 and \u2018what is and\nis-not\u2019, and, concomitantly, whether one treats what belief and\nknowledge are \u2018set over\u2019 as propositions or objects. Three\ndifferent readings of the \u2018is\u2019 seem possible: a) the\nexistential; b) the veridical; and c) the predicative.\n\n\nOn the existential reading, knowledge is set over what exists; belief\nis set over what exists and does not exist. On the predicative\nreading, knowledge is set over Forms, what is F, for any\nproperty F (or some privileged kinds of properties, e.g.\nincomplete properties); belief is set over what is F and\nnot-F, the material particulars. The existential and\npredicative readings typically are committed to objects as what\nknowledge and belief are set over. Since it is hard to make sense of\nwhat it could be for an object to exist and not exist, the existential\nreading has found little support. (There are other objections to an\nexistential reading, principally that many think that Plato never\nworks with an \u2018is\u2019 of existence (see Owen 1986c).\n\n\nThe predicative reading, on the other hand, lends itself to a\ndefense of the Two Worlds account of Plato's metaphysics. The objects\nof belief and knowledge are distinct. Accordingly, one can have only\nbeliefs about the particulars and about particulars only beliefs, and\nonly knowledge of Forms and of Forms one can only have knowledge. It\nfollows that knowledge cannot be any kind of justified true belief, not\neven one \u2018tied down\u2019 by the account of the appropriate\ncause. (See Meno 98a). Moreover, since one can have only\nknowledge of Forms, one cannot have any false beliefs about Forms.\nGiven that in Book I of the Republic the interlocutors seem to\nhave many false beliefs about Justice, e.g., that Justice is returning\nwhat is due, this consequence may be more worrisome than that which\nproscribes knowledge of the affairs of actual cities.\n\n\nAccording to the veridical reading (see Fine 1978; 1990), the\n\u2018objects\u2019 of belief and knowledge are best treated as\npropositions. Knowledge is set over what is true, i.e., the set of\ntrue propositions; belief is set over what is true and not true, or\nfalse, namely the set of all propositions. The veridical reading\nregards the overlap between the objects of the distinct\nfaculties\u2014the set of true propositions\u2014as a virtue, since\nit allows one to give a justified true belief interpretation to\nknowledge and allows one to have both beliefs about and knowledge of\nForms and of sensible objects.\n",
