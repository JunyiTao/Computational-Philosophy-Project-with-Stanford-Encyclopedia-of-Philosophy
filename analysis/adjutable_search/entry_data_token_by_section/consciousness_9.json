    "main_text": "The descriptive question: What are the features of consciousness? || Phenomenal structure\n4.3 Phenomenal structure\n\nPhenomenal structure should not be conflated with\nqualitative structure, despite the sometimes interchangeable use of\n\u201cqualia\u201d and \u201cphenomenal properties\u201d in the\nliterature. \u201cPhenomenal organization\u201d covers all the\nvarious kinds of order and structure found within the domain of\nexperience, i.e., within the domain of the world as it appears\nto us. There are obviously important links between the phenomenal and\nthe qualitative. Indeed qualia might be best understood as properties\nof phenomenal or experienced objects, but there is in fact far more to\nthe phenomenal than raw feels. As Kant (1787), Husserl (1913), and\ngenerations of phenomenologists have shown, the phenomenal structure of\nexperience is richly intentional and involves not only sensory ideas\nand qualities but complex representations of time, space, cause, body,\nself, world and the organized structure of lived reality in all its\nconceptual and nonconceptual forms.\n\n\nSince many non-conscious states also have intentional and\nrepresentational aspects, it may be best to consider phenomenal\nstructure as involving a special kind of intentional and\nrepresentational organization and content, the kind distinctively\nassociated with consciousness (Siewert 1998). (See the entry on\n representational theories of consciousness.)\n\n\nAnswering the What question requires a careful account of the\ncoherent and densely organized representational framework within which\nparticular experiences are embedded. Since most of that structure is\nonly implicit in the organization of experience, it can not just be\nread off by introspection. Articulating the structure of the phenomenal\ndomain in a clear and intelligible way is a long and difficult process\nof inference and model building (Husserl 1929). Introspection can aid\nit, but a lot of theory construction and ingenuity are also needed.\n\nThere has been recent philosophical debate about the range of\nproperties that are phenomenally present or manifest in conscious\nexperience, in particular with respect to cognitive states such as\nbelieving or thinking.  Some have argued for a so called\n\u201cthin\u201d view according to which phenomenal properties are\nlimited to qualia representing basic sensory properties, such as\ncolors, shapes, tones and feels.  According to such theorists, there\nis no distinctive \u201cwhat-it-is-likeness\u201d involved in\nbelieving that Paris is the capital of France or that 17 is a prime\nnumber (Tye, Prinz 2012).  Some imagery, e.g., of the Eiffel Tower, may\naccompany our having such a thought, but that is incidental to it\nand the cognitive state itself has no phenomenal feel.  On the thin\nview, the phenomenal aspect of perceptual states as well is limited to\nbasic sensory features; when one sees an image of Winston Churchill,\none's perceptual phenomenology is limited only to the spatial aspects\nof his face.\n\n\nOthers holds a \u201cthick\u201d view according to which the\nphenomenology of perception includes a much wider range of features\nand cognitive states have a distinctive phenomenology as well\n(Strawson 2003, Pitt 2004, Seigel 2010). On the thick view, the\nwhat-it-is-likeness of perceiving an image of Marilyn Monroe includes\none's recognition of her history as part of the felt aspect of the\nexperience, and beliefs and thoughts as well can and typically do have\na distinctive nonsensory phenomenology.  Both sides of the debate are\nwell represented in the volume Cognitive Phenomenology (Bayne and\nMontague 2010). \n",
