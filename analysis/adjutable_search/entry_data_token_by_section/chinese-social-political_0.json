The Scope of the \u201cPolitical\u201d\n\nOn one common reading, a ruler\u2019s authority is based in\nindividual moral charisma (or virtue; de). The famous\n\u201cMandate of Heaven (tianming)\u201d theory has its\nroots in the way that the Zhou people legitimized their conquest of\nthe Shang. Passages in the Book of History tell us that\nHeaven (tian: the deity of the Zhou people) had transferred\nits \u201cmandate\u201d from the Shang to the Zhou leaders, as a\nresult of the depravity and misrule of the Shang kings. The Zhou\nleadership claimed to know this by employing oracle bone divination:\nthey adopted the Shang practice of divining, but put it to the new use\nof justifying political authority, and thus the shift of\nHeaven\u2019s favor (partly by eliding the difference between the\nShang chief deity and their own). One aspect of this transformation\nwas transforming Heaven into a moral figure, a god who made judgments\nbased on the perceived virtue of the leader (Allan 1984). As we will\nsee below, by the time of the Warring States era and the foundational\ntexts of Confucian philosophy, there have been further\ntransformations: Heaven is no longer a figure at all, but closer to an\nabstract sense of the normative order of the universe, and its\nintentions are no longer accessible via divination. Still, most modern\nscholars hold that for the majority of classical thinkers, an ethical\nideal continues to serve as the ultimate justification of political\nauthority.\n\nIt must be acknowledged, though, that there is attention in Confucian\ntexts to procedural matters and to the norm of \u201corder\u201d, at\nleast partly separate from rulers\u2019 virtue. Some interpreters\nhave argued that this means the Confucians recognized a distinct\nspecies of \u201cpolitical\u201d norms, and that such political\nconcerns were more important to the Confucians than the achievement of\nindividual, rarefied ethical states. For example, in his discussion of\nunder what circumstances Mencius judges a rebellion to be justified,\nJustin Tiwald emphasizes that Mencius \u201cputs a great deal of\nweight on the essentially procedural requirement that the ruler be\nproperly designated for the task\u201d (Tiwald 2008: 274).\nEven more explicitly, Loubna El Amine argues at length in her\nClassical Confucian Political Thought for the importance of a\ndistinct sphere of politics. She says that while \u201cthe realm of\npolitics is not completely distinct from the realm of ethics,\u2026\npolitical order, not moral edification, is the end\u201d; and\nfurthermore that \u201cpolitical order is an end in itself, not a\nmeans toward virtue\u201d (El Amine 2015: 15).\n\nAll interpreters agree that there is at least a narrow kind of\npolitical legitimacy in play, of the type that tells one who the\nlegitimate heir to the throne should be. According to the\nMencius, in the earliest days, political power was passed on\nvia sagely, particularistic assessment of who was most qualified to\nrule, coupled with the endorsement of Heaven, as viewed through the\nactions of the people. This is how the throne was passed from Yao to\nShun, and from Shun to Yu. This practice quickly fell apart, though,\nand in its (supposed) place arose the mechanisms of hereditary\nmonarchy (MC 5A:5 and 5A:6). This is an ingenious explanation for the\nshift that also helps to explain why Confucius was never tapped to\nrule in the way that Shun had been. Mou Zongsan has influentially\nargued that the shift from sagely judgment on who is best fit to rule,\nto hereditary monarchy, is a shift from a holistic form of ethical\nauthority to what is merely an effective technology for the\nadministration of power instead of genuine political authority (Mou\n1991: 132). In other words, Mou agrees with El Amine on the existence\nof a relatively distinct realm of politics, though\u2014writing as a\nmodern Confucian philosopher\u2014Mou regrets the degree to which\nthis shallow form of politics is disconnected from justification\ndeeper than \u201corder\u201d, and argues for a re-imagining of\nConfucian politics (on which see\n Section 5).\n\nWhile Mou\u2019s argument that Confucian political thought is too\nnarrow is certainly controversial, all agree that at least some\nclassical thinkers focus on effective technology for the\nadministration of power and the maintenance of order, to the exclusion\nof ethical concerns. Indeed, one of the better arguments that\nConfucians really did refuse to separate the ethical and the political\nis simply that so many of the Confucians\u2019 critics interpreted\nthem in this way. Whatever we decide about early Confucians, it is\nquite evident that a millennium later, most Neo-Confucians took ethics\nand politics to be mutually entailing, as we will see in\n Section 4.\n",
