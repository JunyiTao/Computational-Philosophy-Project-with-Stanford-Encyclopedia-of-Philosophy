    "main_text": "Arguments for Miracle Claims || Categorical and confirmatory arguments\n2.1 Categorical and confirmatory arguments\n\n\nTwo dimensions of classification help to bring into focus the nature\nof the various arguments that have been advanced on behalf of miracle\nclaims, one having to do with the aims of the arguments and the other\nhaving to do with their structure.\n\n\nWe may first distinguish between arguments designed to show that\ntheir conclusions are true, reasonable, or justified, on the one hand,\nand arguments designed to show that their conclusions are more\nreasonable or more justified than they were apart from the\nconsiderations adduced. The former we may stipulatively call\ncategorical arguments; the latter, confirmatory\narguments. When the arguments are probabilistic in nature, this reduces\nto Richard Swinburne\u2019s terminology of P-inductive and C-inductive\narguments, the former intending to show that the conclusion (in this\ncase that the miracle in question has actually occurred) is probable to\nsome specific degree, or at least more probable than not, and the\nlatter intending to show that the conclusion is more probable given the\nevidence presented than it is considered independently of that\nevidence (Swinburne, 2004). But the broader distinction between\narguments that purport to command our rational assent and arguments\nthat have the more modest goal of showing their conclusions to be to\nsome (perhaps specified) extent confirmed is one that can be employed\nindependently of the use of the language of probability.\n",
