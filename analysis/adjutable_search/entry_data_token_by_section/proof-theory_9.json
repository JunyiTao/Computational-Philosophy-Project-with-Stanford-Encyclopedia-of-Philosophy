Hilbert\u2019s Program, Extended \n\nAccording to Bernays, the reductive result due to G\u00f6del and\nGentzen,\n Theorem 1.2,\n has a dramatic impact on the work concerned with Hilbert\u2019s\nprogram. It opened in a very concrete and precise way the finitist\nperspective to a broader \u201cconstructive\u201d one. Hilbert\nhimself had taken such a step in a much vaguer way in his last paper\n(Hilbert 1931b).\n Theorem 1.2\n showed, after all, that PA is contained in\nHA via the negative translation. Since\nHA comprises just a fragment of Brouwer\u2019s\nintuitionism, the consistency of PA is secured on the\nbasis of the intuitionist standpoint. In a letter to Heyting of 25\nFebruary 1933, Gentzen suggested investigating the consistency of\nHA since a consistency proof for classical arithmetic\nhad not been given so far by finitist means. He then continued\n\n\nIf on the other hand, one admits the intuitionistic position as a\nsecure basis in itself, i.e., as a consistent one, the consistency of\nclassical arithmetic is secured by my result. If one wished to satisfy\nHilbert\u2019s requirements, the task would still remain of showing\nintuitionistic arithmetic consistent. This, however, is not possible\nby even the formal apparatus of classical arithmetic, on the basis of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s result in combination with my proof. Even so, I am\ninclined to believe that a consistency proof for intuitionistic\narithmetic, from an even more evident position, is possible and\ndesirable. (quoted and translated in von Plato 2009: 672)\n\n\nG\u00f6del took a very similar position in December of 1933\n(G\u00f6del 1995: 53). There he broadened the idea of a revised\nversion of Hilbert\u2019s program allowing constructive means that go\nbeyond the finitist ones without accepting fully fledged intuitionism;\nthe latter he considered to be problematic, in particular on account\nof the impredicative nature of intuitionist implication. As to an\nextension of Hilbert\u2019s position he wrote:\n\n\nBut there remains the hope that in future one may find other and more\nsatisfactory methods of construction beyond the limits of the system A\n[capturing finitist methods], which may enable us to found classical\narithmetic and analysis upon them. This question promises to be a\nfruitful field for further investigations.\n\n\nIn\n section 3.2\n we described Gentzen\u2019s considerations; in\n section 4.2\n we discuss G\u00f6del\u2019s as developed in the late 1930s. In\n section 4.1\n we sketch some other constructive positions.\n",
