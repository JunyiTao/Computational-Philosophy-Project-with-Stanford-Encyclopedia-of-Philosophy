    "main_text": "The Content of Beliefs || De Re Versus De Dicto Belief Attributions\n3.3 De Re Versus De Dicto Belief Attributions\n\nQuine (1956) introduced contemporary philosophy of mind to the\ndistinction between de re and de dicto belief\nattributions by means of examples like the following. Ralph sees a\nsuspicious-looking man in a trenchcoat and concludes that that man is\na spy. Unbeknownst to him, however, the man in the trenchcoat is the\nnewly elected mayor, Bernard J. Ortcutt, and Ralph would sincerely\ndeny the claim that \u201cthe mayor is a spy\u201d. So does Ralph\nbelieve that the mayor is a spy? There appears to be a sense in which\nhe does and a sense in which he does not. Philosophers have attempted\nto characterize the difference between these two senses by saying that\nRalph believes de re, of that man (the man in the trenchcoat\nwho happens also to be the mayor), that \u201che is a spy\u201d,\nwhile he does not believe de dicto that \u201cthe mayor is a\nspy\u201d.\n\nThe standard test for distinguishing de re from de\ndicto attributions is referential transparency or\nopacity. A sentence, or more accurately a position in a\nsentence, is held to be referentially transparent if terms or phrases\nin that position that refer to the same object can be freely\nsubstituted without altering the truth of the sentence. The\n(non-belief attributing) sentence \u201cJill kicked X\u201d\nis naturally read as referentially transparent in this sense. If\n\u201cJill kicked the ball\u201d is true, then so also is any\nsentence in which \u201cthe ball\u201d is replaced by a term or\nphrase that refers to that same ball, e.g., \u201cJill kicked\nDavy\u2019s favorite birthday present\u201d, \u201cJill kicked the\nthing we bought at Walmart on August 26\u201d. Sentences, or\npositions, are referentially opaque just in case they are not\ntransparent, that is, if the substitution of co-referring terms or\nphrases could potentially alter their truth value. De dicto\nbelief attribution is held to be referentially opaque in this sense.\nOn the de dicto reading of belief, \u201cRalph believes that\nthe man in the trenchcoat is a spy\u201d may be true while\n\u201cRalph believes that the mayor is a spy\u201d is false.\nLikewise, on a de dicto reading, \u201cLois Lane believes\nthat Superman is strong\u201d may be true while \u201cLois believes\nthat Clark Kent is strong\u201d is false, even if Superman and Clark\nKent are, unbeknownst to Lois, one and the same person. (Regarding the\nLois example, however, see also \u00a73.5, on Frege\u2019s Puzzle,\nbelow.)\n\nIn some contexts, the liberal substitution of co-referential terms or\nphrases seems permissible in ascribing belief. Shifting examples,\nsuppose Davy is a preschooler who has just met a new teacher, Mrs.\nSanchez, who is Mexican, and he finds her too strict. Davy\u2019s\nmother, in reporting this fact to his father, might say \u201cDavy\nthinks Mrs. Sanchez is too strict\u201d or \u201cDavy thinks the new\nMexican teacher is too strict\u201d, even though Davy does not know\nthe teacher\u2019s name or that she is Mexican. Similarly, if Ralph\neventually discovers that the man in the trenchcoat was Ortcutt, he\nmight, in recounting the incident to his friends later, laughingly\nsay, \u201cFor a moment, I thought the mayor was a spy!\u201d or\n\u201cFor a moment, I thought Ortcutt was a spy\u201d. In a de\nre mood, then, we can say that Davy believes, of X, that\nshe is too strict and Ralph believes, of Y, that he is a spy,\nwhere X is replaced by any term or phrase that picks out Mrs.\nSanchez and Y is replaced by any term or phrase that picks\nout Ortcutt\u2014though of course, depending on the situation,\npragmatic considerations will favor the use of some terms or phrases\nover others. In a strict de re sense, perhaps we can even say\nthat Lois believes, of Clark Kent, that he is strong (though she may\nalso simultaneously believe of him that he is not strong).\n\nThe standard view, then, takes belief-attributing sentences to be\nsystematically ambiguous between a referentially opaque, de\ndicto structure and a referentially transparent, de re\nstructure. Sometimes this view is conjoined with the view that de\nre but not de dicto belief requires some kind of direct\nacquaintance with the object of belief.\n\nThe majority of the literature on the de re / de\ndicto distinction since at least the 1980s has challenged this\nstandard view in one way or another. The challenges are sufficiently\ndiverse that they resist brief classification, except perhaps to\nremark that a number of them invoke pragmatics or conversational\ncontext, instead of an ambiguity in the term \u201cbelief\u201d, or\nin the structure of belief ascriptions, to explain the fact that it\nseems in some way appropriate and in some way inappropriate to say\nthat Ralph believes the mayor is a spy.\n\nAmong the more important discussions of the de re / de\ndicto distinction are Quine (1956), Kaplan (1968), Burge (1977),\nLewis (1979), Stich (1983), Dennett (1987), Crimmins (1992), Brandom\n(1994), Jeshion (2002), Taylor (2002), and Keshet (2010).
