    "main_text": "John Duns Scotus\n8. Epilogue\n\n\nIt is easy to miss the significance of what Scotus brought about: in\npart because it now seems so inevitable, in part because Scotus comes\nat the end of a gradual trend toward naturalism, and in part because until only recently\nit was generally supposed that nothing of much philosophical importance\nhappened between Aristotle and Descartes. Yet if one looks at the big\npicture of our evolving philosophical/scientific understanding of the\nmind, then it is clear that something important happened at the end of\nthe thirteenth century. \n\n\nStill, Scotus\u2019s impact should not be overstated. Although divine\nillumination, so called, would no longer have many prominent\nsupporters, the tendency toward supernatural explanations of cognitive\nphenomena would survive well beyond the Renaissance. Descartes, to take\none prominent example, can speak of \u201ccertain seeds of truth which are\nnaturally in our souls\u201d (Discourse on Method 6, AT VI:64), and of \u201cideas implanted in the intellect by nature\u201d (Principles of Philosophy 2.3). In its details, the view is strikingly similar to Aquinas\u2019s: Descartes identifies these ideas as the basis of our knowledge of first principles; he holds that the ideas themselves\nare formed only in virtue of sensory impressions; he identifies God as\nthe ultimate source of these ideas. Moreover, if Descartes is playing\nAquinas, in modern dress, then as Henry of Ghent we can cast\nMalebranche, who argues that \u201cAll our ideas must be located in the\nefficacious substance of the Divinity, which alone is intelligible or\ncapable of enlightening us, because it alone can affect intelligences\u201d\n(Search after Truth, p. 232). Malebranche\u2019s remarkable view \u2014\nin support of which he quotes Augustine \u2014 is that all our ideas are\nseen in God. This is illumination theory, all over again. But by the\nseventeenth century the philosophical context has changed so\ndramatically that these modern developments must be regarded as a\ndifferent topic.\n",
