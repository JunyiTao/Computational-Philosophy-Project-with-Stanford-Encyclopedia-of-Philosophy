    "main_text": "Historical development of Hilbert\u2019s Program || Finitism and the quest for consistency proofs\n1.3 Finitism and the quest for consistency proofs\n\nWithin the next few years, however, Hilbert came to reject\nRussell\u2019s logicist solution to the consistency problem for\narithmetic. At the same time,\n Brouwer\u2019s\n intuitionistic mathematics gained currency. In particular,\nHilbert\u2019s former student Hermann Weyl converted to intuitionism.\nWeyl\u2019s paper \u201cThe new foundational crisis in\nmathematics\u201d\n (1921)\n was answered by Hilbert in three talks in Hamburg in the Summer of\n1921\n (1922b).\n Here, Hilbert presented his own proposal for a solution to the\nproblem of the foundation of mathematics. This proposal incorporated\nHilbert\u2019s ideas from 1904 regarding direct consistency proofs,\nhis conception of axiomatic systems, and also the technical\ndevelopments in the axiomatization of mathematics in the work of\nRussell as well as the further developments carried out by him and his\ncollaborators. What was new was the way in which Hilbert wanted to\nimbue his consistency project with the philosophical significance\nnecessary to answer Brouwer and Weyl\u2019s criticisms: the finitary\npoint of view.\n\nAccording to Hilbert, there is a privileged part of mathematics,\ncontentual elementary number theory, which relies only on a\n\u201cpurely intuitive basis of concrete signs.\u201d Whereas the\noperating with abstract concepts was considered \u201cinadequate and\nuncertain,\u201d there is a realm of\n\nextra-logical discrete objects, which exist intuitively as immediate\nexperience before all thought. If logical inference is to be certain,\nthen these objects must be capable of being completely surveyed in all\ntheir parts, and their presentation, their difference, their\nsuccession (like the objects themselves) must exist for us\nimmediately, intuitively, as something which cannot be reduced to\nsomething else.\n (Hilbert 1922b,\n 202; the passage is repeated almost verbatim in\n Hilbert 1926,\n 376,\n Hilbert 1928,\n 464, and\n Hilbert 1931b,\n 267)\n\n\nThese objects were, for Hilbert, signs. The domain of\ncontentual number theory consists in the finitary numerals, i.e.,\nsequences of strokes. These have no meaning, i.e., they do not stand\nfor abstract objects, but they can be operated on (e.g., concatenated)\nand compared. Knowledge of their properties and relations is intuitive\nand unmediated by logical inference. Contentual number theory\ndeveloped this way is secure, according to Hilbert: no contradictions\ncan arise simply because there is no logical structure in the\npropositions of contentual number theory.\n\nThe intuitive-contentual operations with signs forms the basis of\nHilbert\u2019s metamathematics. Just as contentual number theory\noperates with sequences of strokes, so metamathematics operates with\nsequences of symbols (formulas, proofs). Formulas and proofs can be\nsyntactically manipulated, and the properties and relationships of\nformulas and proofs are similarly based in a logic-free intuitive\ncapacity which guarantees certainty of knowledge about formulas and\nproofs arrived at by such syntactic operations. Mathematics itself,\nhowever, operates with abstract concepts, e.g., quantifiers, sets,\nfunctions, and uses logical inference based on principles such as\nmathematical induction or the principle of the excluded middle. These\n\u201cconcept-formations\u201d and modes of reasoning had been\ncriticized by Brouwer and others on grounds that they presuppose\ninfinite totalities as given, or that they involve impredicative\ndefinitions (which were considered by the critics as viciously\ncircular). Hilbert\u2019s aim was to justify their use. To this end,\nhe pointed out that they can be formalized in axiomatic systems (such\nas that of Principia or those developed by Hilbert himself),\nand mathematical propositions and proofs thus turn into formulas and\nderivations from axioms according to strictly circumscribed rules of\nderivation. Mathematics, so Hilbert, \u201cbecomes an inventory of\nprovable formulas.\u201d In this way the proofs of mathematics are\nsubject to metamathematical, contentual investigation. The goal of\nHilbert\u2019s program is then to give a contentual, metamathematical\nproof that there can be no derivation of a contradiction, i.e., no\nformal derivations of a formula \\(A\\) and of its negation \\(\\neg\nA\\).\n\nThis sketch of the aims of the program was fleshed out by Hilbert and\nhis collaborators in the following 10 years. On the conceptual side,\nthe finite standpoint and the strategy for a consistency proof were\nelaborated by\n Hilbert (1928);\n Hilbert (1923);\n Hilbert (1926)\n and\n Bernays (1928b);\n Bernays (1922);\n Bernays (1930),\n of which Hilbert\u2019s article \u201cOn the infinite\u201d\n (1926)\n provides the most detailed elaboration of the finitary standpoint. In\naddition to Hilbert and Bernays, a number of other people were\ninvolved in technical work on the program. In lectures given in\nG\u00f6ttingen\n (Hilbert and Bernays, 1923;\n Hilbert, 1922a), Hilbert and Bernays developed the\n \\(\\varepsilon\\)-calculus\n as their definitive formalism for axiom systems for arithmetic and\nanalysis. Hilbert there also presented his approach to giving\nconsistency proofs using his so-called \\(\\varepsilon\\)-substitution\nmethod.\n Ackermann (1924)\n attempted to extend Hilbert\u2019s idea to a system of analysis. The\nproof was, however, erroneous (see\n Zach 2003).\n John von Neumann, then visiting G\u00f6ttingen, gave a corrected\nconsistency proof for a system of the \\(\\varepsilon\\)-formalism\n(which, however, did not include the induction axiom) in 1925\n(published in\n 1927).\n Building on von Neumann\u2019s work, Ackermann devised a new\n\\(\\varepsilon\\)-substitution procedure which he communicated to\nBernays (see\n Bernays 1928b).\n In his address \u201cProblems of the grounding of mathematics\u201d\nto the International Congress of Mathematicians in Bologna in 1928\n (1929),\n Hilbert optimistically claimed that the work of Ackermann and von\nNeumann had established the consistency of number theory and that the\nproof for analysis had already been carried out by Ackermann \u201cto\nthe extent that the only remaining task consists in the proof of an\nelementary finiteness theorem that is purely arithmetical.\u201d\n",
