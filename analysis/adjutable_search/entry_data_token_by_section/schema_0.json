    "main_text": "What is a Schema?\n1. What is a Schema?\n\nA schema is a complex system consisting of\n\na template-text or schema-template: a syntactic\nstring composed of significant words and/or symbols and also of\nplaceholders (letters, blanks, circled numbers, ellipses, ordinal\nnumber expressions like \u2018the first\u2019 and \u2018the\nsecond\u2019, etc.), and\na side condition specifying how the placeholders are to\nbe filled to obtain instances, and also, sometimes, how the\nsignificant words or symbols are to be understood (Tarski 1933/1983:\n155; Church 1956: 172). In particular, the side condition specifies\nthe language, whether natural or formal, to which the instances of the\nschema are to belong.\n\n\nAmong the best-known schemas is Tarski\u2019s schema T, whose\ntemplate-text is the eight-word two-ellipsis string:\n\n\u2026is a true sentence if and only if\u2026.\n\n\nThe side condition requires that the second blank is to be filled in\nwith a (declarative) sentence of English and the first blank is to be\nfilled in by a name of that sentence (Tarski 1933/1983: 155). The\nfollowing string is an instance: \n\n\u2018zero is one\u2019 is a true sentence if and only if zero is\none.\n\n\nMore revealing instances are obtained by using a sentence not known to\nbe true and not known to be false: \n\n\u2018every perfect number is even\u2019 is a true sentence if and\nonly if every perfect number is even.\n\n\nThe fourteen-word sentence\n\nEither zero is even or it is not the case that zero is even.\n\n\nis an instance of the excluded-middle sentence schema for\nEnglish, which involves the template \n\nEither \\(A\\) or it is not the case that \\(A\\).\n\n\nThe side condition is that the two occurrences of \u2018\\(A\\)\u2019\nare to be filled by occurrences of the same well-formed English\ndeclarative sentence, that the discontinuous expression \u2018Either\n\u2026 or \u2026 \u2019; expresses classical non-exclusive\ndisjunction, and that the six-word sentence-prefix \u2018it is not\nthe case that\u2019; expresses classical negation. Notice that this\nschema-template is not an English sentence. It would be strictly\nspeaking incoherent to use it as a sentence in an attempted\nassertion. It would also be wrong to call it true or false, though it\ncan be characterized as valid or invalid, in appropriate senses of\nthese ambiguous words. \n\nSome logicians seem to identify the schema with the template alone.\n(Tarski\u2019s wording at 1933/1983: 155\u20136 suggests this\nidentification, while Church\u2019s at 1956: 149 seems calculated to\navoid it.) But one and the same schema-template may be a component of\nany number of different schemata depending on the side condition or\nthe underlying language. Furthermore, since different characters or\nstrings can be used as placeholders (see above) and since even one\nnotational change produces a different syntactic string in the strict\nsense (Corcoran et al. 1974), one and the same set of instances may be\ndetermined by different schema-template/side-condition pairings even\ngiven a fixed language. It may be this fact that leads some authors to\nwrite as though the schema is to be identified with the set of\ninstances. For many purposes it is the set of specified instances that\nis of primary importance and the question of exactly what is involved\nin specifying it is considered a mere technicality.\n\nSometimes (as in the excluded-middle schema, above) the placeholders\nin a schema-template are marked by letters. It is important to keep in\nmind the distinction between, on one hand, an open sentence, such as\n\u2018\\((x + y) = (y + x)\\)\u2019; whose object-language numerical\nvariables \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(y\\)\u2019 range over the\nnumbers and, on the other, a schema such as the number-theoretic\ncommutativity schema whose template-text is \u2018\\((X + Y) = (Y\n+ X)\\)\u2019; and whose side condition is that the two occurrences of\n\u2018\\(X\\)\u2019 are to be replaced by two occurrences of one and\nthe same numeral, and likewise for the two occurrences of\n\u2018\\(Y\\)\u2019. The numerals belong to the object language, while\nthe place-holders belong to the metalanguage. The variables in the\nobject-language range over a domain of objects, while the \u2018dummy\nletters\u2019 in the template-text are just placeholders for syntactic\nsubstituends. (For a careful exposition of the distinction, see Quine\n1945: sec. 1.)\n\nSchemas may be classed by the syntactic type of their instances as\nsentence schemas, subsentential schemas, or argument-text schemas. We\nhave already seen two examples of sentence schemas. The string\n\nthe successor of \\(A\\)\n\n\nis the template-text for a subsentential schema, where the\nside condition specifies that the letter \u2018\\(A\\)\u2019 be\nreplaced by an arabic numeral. The definite description \n\nthe successor of 9\n\n\nwould be an instance. Note that this schema is very different from the\nopen term \n\nthe successor of \\(x\\),\n\n\nwhere the \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 is an object-language variable. The\nschema is essentially a recipe for generating syntactic instances. The\n\u2018dummy letter\u2019 \u2018\\(A\\)\u2019 in its template-text is\njust a placeholder for substituends (here, numerals). The\n\u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 in the open term, by contrast, is a variable\nranging over objects (here, numbers).\n\n\nAn argument-text schema is a schema whose instances are\nargument-texts. An argument-text is a two part system\ncomposed of a set of sentences called the premises and a single\nsentence called the conclusion. (An argument is that which is\nexpressed by an argument-text, as a proposition is that which is\nexpressed by a sentence.) Of the various ways of presenting an\nargument-text perhaps the one least open to misinterpretation is the\npremises-line-conclusion format which consists in listing the premises\nfollowed by a line followed by the conclusion. For example:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&  \\textrm{Every circle is a polygon.}\\\\\n&  \\textrm{Every triangle is a circle.}\\\\\n& \\textrm{Every square is a triangle.}\\\\\\hline\n& \\textrm{Every square is a polygon.}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nAn example of an argument-text schema is the inference rule modus\nponens: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&  A\\\\\n& \\textrm{if } A \\textrm{ then }B\\\\\\hline\n&  B\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nThe side condition specifies that \u2018\\(A\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(B\\)\u2019 be replaced with declarative sentences of English,\nand that both occurrences of \u2018\\(A\\)\u2019 (and likewise of\n\u2018\\(B\\)\u2019) be replaced by the same sentence or formula.\n\n\nAxiom schemas can be thought of as zero-premise argument-text\nschemas.\n",
