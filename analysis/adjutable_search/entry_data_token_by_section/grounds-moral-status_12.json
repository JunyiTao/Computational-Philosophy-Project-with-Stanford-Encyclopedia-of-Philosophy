    "main_text": "Grounds of Moral Status || Member of Cognitively Sophisticated Species\n5.4 Member of Cognitively Sophisticated Species\n\nOne way to avoid the key problems of the previous accounts is to posit\nmembership in the human species as a sufficient condition for FMS.\nThis is not the view that the human species itself has FMS, but rather\nthat membership in the species gives an individual FMS. Feinberg\n(1980) discusses this view, whereas Dworkin (1993, ch. 3) actually\nposits it, although without distinguishing between this version and\nthe modified version addressed below. Benn (1967, pp. 69\u201371)\nconsiders membership in the human species necessary and sufficient for\nFMS. Note that belonging to the human species is a relational feature\n(the relation of being a member of a kind), unlike the features\ninvoked by the accounts considered thus far.\n\nIf there are non-human cognitively sophisticated individuals, such as\nhigher animals or alien species, they would seem to deserve a high\nmoral status equal to that of human beings. Thus, this account should\nnot make human species membership a necessary condition for FMS, but\nrather be disjunctive: having sophisticated cognitive capacities or\nbelonging to the human species is necessary and sufficient for\nFMS.\n\nBy introducing the latter condition (human species membership), such a\nview can establish FMS not only for infants and severely cognitively\nimpaired human beings but even for fetuses and permanently unconscious\nhuman beings. Moreover, any non-human individual who lacks cognitively\nsophisticated capacities, which includes most (but not all) animals,\nlacks FMS. Thus this view accounts rather nicely for much of the\ncommonsense view described in section 1. However, it is of no help\ngrounding the claim that non-human animals, trees, species, or\necosystems have any moral status.\n\nOne possible cost of this approach is the loss of a unified account of\nFMS. That is, there are now two routes to FMS: having sophisticated\ncognitive capacities or belonging to the human species. Whether one is\ncognitively sophisticated is determined purely by psychology, while\nwhether one belongs to the human species is determined purely by\nbiology. Of course, it is true that the human species (as opposed to\nits membership criteria) is characterized both psychologically and\nbiologically, and so in this sense the second route to FMS is related\nto the first.\n\nA second problem is an arbitrary distinction between severely\ncognitively impaired humans and members of other similarly cognitively\nsophisticated species, were they to exist, who have analogous severe\ncognitive impairments. Imagine, for example, a cognitively\nsophisticated biological species of \u201cMartians,\u201d which has\nsome severely cognitively impaired members. Even if an impaired\nMartian and an impaired human have similarly limited cognitive\ncapacities, and even though they bear the same metaphysical relation\nto members of their species (they are both tokens of a biological type\nwhose unimpaired members are cognitively sophisticated), this account\nnevertheless treats them as having a different moral status. This is\nunacceptably arbitrary.\n\nOne could modify this account by substituting membership in a\ncognitively sophisticated species for membership in the human species\nas the second sufficient condition for FMS (Cohen 1986; possibly\nScanlon 1998, pp.185\u201386; and Finnis 1995). This approach is\noften implicit rather than explicitly stated and defended. For\nexample, Korsgaard (2004) regards infants and severely cognitive\nimpaired human beings as rational agents \u2013 presumably in the\nsense of being members of the kind \u201crational agents\u201d\n\u2013 and hence deserving of respect.\n\nThis version of the account is now more unified and avoids the above\ncharge of arbitrariness, while retaining the alignment with the\ncommonsense view. Both sufficient conditions of FMS now ultimately\nappeal to the value of cognitively sophisticated capacities, and\ncognitively impaired members of all cognitively sophisticated species\nhave the same moral status. Moreover, most animals still lack FMS\nsince neither they nor their species are cognitively\nsophisticated.\n\nDespite its advantages, even this modified version has problems.\nFirst, whether one belongs to a given species depends on biological\ncriteria, such as whom one can mate with, whom one is born of, or\nhaving the relevant DNA. But it is unclear why these biological\ncriteria are relevant for moral status. The point can be sharpened\nthis way. The human species, for example, is a morally relevant\ncategory because the species is characterized, in part, by morally\nrelevant properties such as sophisticated intellectual and emotional\ncapacities, and not merely by biological criteria (e.g., mating\nabilities). But it is unclear why a token member of a species, a token\nlacking any of these morally relevant capacities, should get the moral\nstatus from the type it belongs to (the species). If membership in the\ntype does not require any of the morally relevant features, how can\nthe membership be morally relevant? Consequently, this modified\naccount has its own problem of arbitrariness (Feinberg 1980, p. 193;\nSumner 1981, pp. 97\u2013101; and McMahan 2002, pp. 212\u2013214,\n216). McMahan provides an especially interesting imaginary example\ninvolving cognitively enhanced Superchimps, which, on the account\nunder consideration, generates counterintuitive consequences for the\nmoral status of the unenhanced chimps. For example, if the Superchimps\ncame to outnumber ordinary unenhanced chimps, the norm for the chimp\nspecies would have changed and for this reason alone the unenhanced\nchimps would have gained higher moral status. A related\ncounterintuitive consequence, not mentioned by McMahan, is the\nfollowing: if the Superchimps become their own species (via gene\ntherapy and interbreeding), a cognitively impaired member of this\nnewly created Superchimp species with the same cognitive capacities as\na non-impaired ordinary chimp (assumed here not to be sufficiently\ncognitively sophisticated to have FMS) would have a very different\nmoral status from the ordinary chimp. And yet the two chimps would be\nalike in every respect other than their species classification.\n\nNotice also that, on this account, an anencephalic human baby (born\nwithout the higher brain) is a member of the human species and so\nwould have FMS. But some might find this inclusion\ncounterintuitive.\n\nThe possibly problematic inclusion of anencephalic infants does not\nseem to apply to the view underlying Little\u2019s (2008) claim that\nFMS is achieved late in pregnancy (pp. 332 and 348), when the fetus,\nwhich was a human organism, becomes a human being (pp. 339\u2013341).\nShe does not state what the criteria are for being a human being, but\nshe may be partially following Quinn 1984 and conceiving of a human\nbeing as one who belongs to the human species and has the\ncapacity to learn (see her page 340), where the latter feature would\nexclude the anencephalics. While on this view being a human being is\nnot a merely biological matter, the view is still open to the problem\nof arbitrariness insofar as it holds that the morally irrelevant,\nmerely biological feature of membership in the human species does make\na difference to moral status.\n\nOne may think that the above objections can be overcome if the\nrelevant criterion for FMS is not conceived of at all in terms of\nmembership in a cognitively sophisticated biological species,\nbut rather in terms of membership in a cognitively sophisticated\nkind. However, this approach faces a dilemma: either (a) a\ncognitively sophisticated kind does not include members who can never\nbe cognitively sophisticated and thus leaves out many severely\ncognitively impaired human beings or (b) cognitive sophistication is\nnot a requirement of membership in a cognitively sophisticated kind\n(e.g., membership requires merely having the relevant genes even if\ntheir expression is blocked by other genes or the environment), but\nthen this membership does not seem to require any morally relevant\nfeatures (e.g. the genes themselves are not morally relevant \u2013\nsee criticisms along these lines in McMahan 2008), and its moral\nrelevance becomes dubious.\n",
