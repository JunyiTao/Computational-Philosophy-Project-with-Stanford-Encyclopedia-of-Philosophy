    "main_text": "Human Dignity: Touchstones of Analysis || Respect: An alternative lens on dignity\n3.4 Respect: An alternative lens on dignity\n\nA complete theory of human dignity must articulate the demands that\ndignity places on us, morally and politically. Some theories, as we\nhave seen, build this expectation into the defining properties of\ndignity. But even when they do not, there is almost always some\nappeal, positive or negative, to some claim about what it means to\nrecognize dignity, and most often to some claim about\nrespect\u2014which, furthermore, is usually claimed to be\nboth what dignity demands and what it means to recognize dignity. The\nsubject of respect, however, is its own labyrinth. It boasts an array\nof meanings, diverse applications, and extensive commentary. This\nsaid, two very general points about respect stand out in connection to\nhuman dignity.\n\nFirst, the connection between dignity and respect has been made\nconcrete in various political contexts. For example, Schachter (1983)\nnotes that Article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and\nPolitical Rights provides that,\n\n\nall persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity\nand with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person. (1983:\n848)\n\n\nHe marks a similar provision in Article 5 of the American\nConvention on Human Rights (Ibid). And this connection generates\ndistinct challenges in the political context that reach beyond the\nhuman rights discourse. Schachter explains:\n\n\nIn the political context, respect for the dignity and worth of all\npersons, and for their individual choices, leads, broadly speaking, to\na strong emphasis on the will and consent of the governed. It means\nthat the coercive rule of one or the few over the many is incompatible\nwith a due respect for the dignity of the person. (1983: 850)\n\n\nHowever, Schachter further points out, many political theories\ncontend,\n\n\nthat substantial equality is a necessary condition of respect for the\nintrinsic worth of the human person\u2026In particular, relations of\ndominance and subordination would be viewed as antithetical to the\nbasic ideal [of human dignity]. If this is so, great discrepancies in\nwealth and power need to be eliminated to avoid such relations.\n(ibid)\n\n\nThe question thus becomes, how can we achieve such egalitarian\nobjectives, without the kind of \u201cexcessive curtailment of\nindividual liberty and the use of coercion\u201d that human dignity\nis also thought to eschew (1983: 850)? This question figures\ninto some of history\u2019s most influential political theories, from\nHegel to Rawls. (For an inroad to understanding the Hegelian line, see\nHonneth 2007; for the Rawlsian line, see Bird 2021.)\n\nSecond, as already hinted, the introduction of respect raises its own\ndistinctive challenge, namely, to explain what respect is. To do this,\nmany theorists appeal, explicitly or implicitly, to what we earlier\ncalled \u201crecognition respect\u201d. When we make plans or choose\nto act, we recognize-respect others when we appropriately take account\nof some fact about them, by adapting, revising, or even foregoing our\nplans and choices in the light of that fact. So, which\n\u201cfact\u201d? Well, if we are talking about respecting persons\nas persons, in a moral sense, many theorists have answered\nthat human dignity is the operative fact. Or, if they drill\ndown further, then whatever they end up defending as the\ngrounds of human dignity\u2014whether rational autonomy,\nspecies membership, an immortal soul, etc.\u2014is the relevant\n fact.[7]\n\nHowever, the last few decades have witnessed a wave of new theorizing\nabout respect. And this has consequences for theorizing about human\ndignity. The most notable consequence stems from the field of care\nethics, where empathy, compassion, and caring have been conceived as\ndistinct kinds of respect. Thus, although human dignity did not figure\nexplicitly into early formulations of care ethics, as conceived by\nthose like Noddings (1984) or Held (2006), care ethics has\nincreasingly been developed in ways that does bring dignity to the\nfore, e.g., by those like Dillon (1992), Kittay (2005 and 2011), and\nMiller (2012). Dillon, in particular, gives voice to a profound\nalternative to rationalist paradigms of human dignity, noted\nfrequently in this entry, and associated especially with Kant. She\nwrites:\n\n\n[Care respect] grounds respect for persons in something which,\nconsidered in the abstract, nearly all human beings have and can be\nsaid to have equally - the characteristic of being an individual human\n\u201cme\u201d - a characteristic which each of us values and thinks\nis both morally important and profoundly morally problematic not only\nin others but in ourselves as well, and which pulls our attention to\nthe concrete particularities of each human individual. We are, on the\ncare respect approach, to pay attention not only to the fact that\nsomeone is a \u201cme\u201d but also to which particular\n\u201cme\u201d she is. (Dillon 1992: 118)\n\n\nThe core idea Dillon expresses here about the grounds of dignity\nqua the concrete \u201cparticularity\u201d of an individual\nperson (as she puts it on 1992: 115), traces to Iris Murdoch (1970)\nand Elizabeth Spelman (1978). It also resonates with the thinking of\nSimon Weil, noted above in\n \u00a73.2.\n More generally, Dillon\u2019s argument illustrates how taking the\nconcept of respect as our starting point might lead to very different\nviews about human dignity.\n",
