    "main_text": "Identity and Change || Diachronic and Synchronic Identity\n2.1 Diachronic and Synchronic Identity\n\nIt is customary to distinguish identity at a time from identity across\ntime. An example of an identity holding at a single time is: the table\nin the next room is (now) identical with my favorite table. An example\nof an identity holding across different times is: The table in the\nnext room is identical with the one you purchased last year.\nDiachronic identities pose some of the most intractable problems about\nidentity. Before looking at those problems, and some of the most\nfrequently proposed solutions to them, let us ask whether there is\nanything that distinguishes identity from other relations.\n\nThe most commonly agreed on distinguishing feature of identity is that\nit conforms to the Indiscernibility of Identicals, what was earlier\ncalled Leibniz's Law. Taking \u2018\u2200F\u2019 to be a\nquantifier ranging over properties, here is one way to formulate\nLeibniz's Law:\n\nLL: \u2200x\u2200y[x=y \u2192\n\u2200F(Fx \u2192 Fy)]\n\n\nLL, understood to range over identity properties, if any, such as\nbeing identical with a, says that if x is identical with\ny, then any property of x is a property of\ny. \n",
