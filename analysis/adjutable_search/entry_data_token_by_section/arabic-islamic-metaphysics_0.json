    "main_text": "The Fundamental Texts, the Approaches, the Issues\n1. The Fundamental Texts, the Approaches, the Issues\n\nThe above considerations show that the fate of metaphysics as a branch\nof philosophy in the Arabic speaking world and in Muslim societies\ncoincides, by and large, with the reception, transmission and\ntransformation of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics. The\nanti-Aristotelian tendencies of the early phase of Arabic philosophy,\nmarked by the adoption of a decidedly Platonic stance in metaphysics\nand the consequent rejection of Aristotle\u2019s teaching, evident in\nthe views of Ab\u016b Bakr Mu\u1e25ammad Ibn Zakariy\u0101\u02be\nal-R\u0101z\u012b (d. ca. 925), remained a local and short-lived\nphenomenon. In mainstream Arabic philosophy, the Metaphysics\nrepresented for centuries the centerpiece of the corresponding\ndiscipline. Aristotle\u2019s work is the only Greek work mentioned in\nconnection with metaphysics in the Arabic classifications of the\nsciences. No other Greek metaphysical work was translated and\ncommented upon in the same continuous, widespread and multiform\nmanner, or quoted so often and extensively in original treatises.\nOther vehicles of Greek metaphysical thought, like the Theologia\nAristotelis, whose avowed aim was to make Aristotle\u2019s work\ncompatible with Islamic creationism by means of the Neoplatonic\ndoctrine of emanation, stress from the outset the primacy of the\nMetaphysics as the fundamental text of metaphysics, and\nfictively portray Aristotle as the author of the adaptation of the\nPlotinian material by means of which the desired completion of the\nMetaphysics is performed. If the\nMetaphysics\u2014as well as the entire Aristotelian\ncorpus\u2014underwent a gradual eclipse in post-Avicennian\nArabic philosophy, this was not due to a decline of its prestige, but\nto the success of Avicenna\u2019s incorporation of the text and the\ndoctrine of Aristotle\u2019s work in his new encyclopedia of the\nphilosophical sciences, The Cure or Healing\n(Al-\u0160if\u0101\u02be) where he constantly stresses his\nreliance on the teaching of the \u201cFirst Master\u201d (Aristotle)\nand his disciples.\n\nSchematically, Arab authors adopted three main ways of approaching the\ntext of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, corresponding to three\ndifferent literary genres. The first approach, which can be called\n\u201ctaxonomical\u201d, is found in classificatory essays whose\ngoal is to outline the content of the Metaphysics and to\nclarify its place in the Aristotelian corpus, and to indicate\nthe position of the discipline of metaphysics in the system of\nknowledge. The \u201cexegetical\u201d approach is represented by\ncommentaries that aim at explaining, with different degrees of\nliteralness and comprehensiveness, the content of the\nMetaphysics. The tendency to adaptation, finally, is visible\nin metaphysical treatises that reformulate the doctrine of\nAristotle\u2019s work and are intended as original elaborations,\nregardless of the degree of dependence on their Greek model. All main\nauthors who considered metaphysics approached Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics, to different extents and degrees, from these\nvarious perspectives.\n\nFrom the doctrinal point of view, Arabic interpreters of the\nMetaphysics debated three basic theoretical issues. First of\nall, they reflected on the scientific configuration of the discipline\npresented by Aristotle in his work, with special focus on fundamental\naspects such as its subject-matter (namely the issue of whether\nmetaphysics is a philosophical theology, or an ontology, or both),\nstructure, method, and position in the system of knowledge. This\nconsideration of the epistemic status of metaphysics took into account\nan enlarged Aristotelian corpus, which included within\ntheoretical philosophy a mathematics based on Euclid and Ptolemy\n(since Aristotle himself wrote no treatise on mathematics), and\ncomplemented the Metaphysics with pseudo-Aristotelian\nNeoplatonic metaphysical works (the Plotinian Theologia\nAristotelis and the Proclean Liber de causis). The\nsecond concern is the investigation of specific doctrines related to\nthe distinct issues within the Metaphysics. The prominent\ntopics within the study of being qua being, or ontology, are\nthe various aspects of the theory of essence, like the clarification\nof its relationship with form and substance, the discussion of the\nepistemological and ontological status of universals, etc. Of central\nimportance in cosmology is the debate about the eternity vs. the\norigination of the world, and the mode of the universe\u2019s\nproduction by the First Principle, whether by way of emanation from\nIts own essence or creation ex nihilo. In philosophical\ntheology, finally, the features that Aristotle ascribes to the divine\nUnmoved Mover, with particular regard to Its unity, necessity and\nintellectual nature, provide the starting-points for far-reaching\ndevelopments. The third concern is the discussion of the relationship\nof the philosophical theology contained in Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics with Islam, namely the assessment of the degree\nof compatibility between the rational conception of the divinity\ntransmitted by Greek philosophy, on the one hand, and the image of God\nconveyed by Islamic prophetic revelation, on the other. The assumption\nof the oneness of truth, common among Arabic philosophers, allows the\nmetaphysical part of philosophy to provide a rational and coherent\naccount of the same divine realm disclosed by revelation, thereby\nputting it in competition with Islamic theology. The results of these\nthree doctrinal concerns are interconnected, since a certain view of\nmetaphysics as a science, and a certain stand on specific doctrinal\npoints, can enhance or reduce the affinity of metaphysics with Islamic\nreligion and the possibility of its integration into Muslim culture. A\nconception of metaphysics that limits the scope of this science to\nphilosophical theology and minimizes the relevance of the general\ndoctrine of being is particularly apt to underscore its compatibility\nwith Islam. By contrast, a view of metaphysics in which the\nontological dimension, in addition to the theological, plays a\nprominent role, and in which the First Principle\u2019s properties\nare discordant, rather than congruent, with the Islamic divine\nattributes, goes in the opposite direction.\n\nThe different textual approaches and theoretical solutions to the\naforementioned problems are assumed here as guidelines for the\narticulation of the history of the Arabic reception of the\nMetaphysics. On this basis, seven main chronological periods\ncan be roughly distinguished. The first five phases culminate in the\nsixth, i.e., in Avicenna, who emerges, at the present stage of\nresearch, as the turning point of the history of Arabic\nmetaphysics.\n",
