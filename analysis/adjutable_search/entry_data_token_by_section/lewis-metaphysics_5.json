    "main_text": "Lewis v. Almost-Lewis\n6. Lewis v. Almost-Lewis\n\nLet\u2019s consider now the most salient ways in which Lewis\u2019s own\npositions about fundamental ontology diverge from those of\nAlmost-Lewis.\n\nFirst, Lewis takes the lessons quantum physics teaches seriously\nenough to withhold endorsement of Almost-Lewis\u2019s fifth thesis,\nthat the only perfectly natural relations are spatiotemporal\nrelations.\n\nSecond, Lewis is agnostic as to whether, in addition to spacetime\npoints, there might be (in this, or other possible worlds) fundamental\nentities that are occupants of such points. But agnosticism\non this score is probably a bad idea: the proposed possibility is not\nclearly intelligible, nor it is clear what its motivation could be.\nFor more, see the supplementary document on\n\nSpacetime Points\n\n\nThird, on a plausible story about what non\u00ad-fundamental\nentities there are, it will turn out that on Almost-Lewis\u2019s view,\neverything that exists is composed of simples (parts, that themselves\nhave no proper parts). Lewis is also agnostic on this score: he takes\nit to be at least an epistemic possibility that there is\n\u201cgunk\u201d: something, every proper part of which itself has a\nproper part (see for example Lewis 1991). Lewis says relatively little\neither about the status of this possibility (in particular, is it more\nthan merely epistemic?), or about its potential ramifications for his\nvarious positions in metaphysics. To keep things simple, I will\ndiscount it for the remainder of this main essay.\n\nFourth, Lewis holds that his thesis of Humean Supervenience is, at\nbest, only contingently true. Of course, given that he\nrecognizes the (metaphysical) possibility of perfectly natural,\nnon-spatiotemporal relations, he should treat HS as at best\ncontingent. But he advances reasons for doing so of a quite different\nsort. They are not particularly good reasons, and so we will pass them\nby; but see the supplementary document on\n\nThe Contingency of Humean Supervenience\n\n\nfor discussion.\n",
