    "main_text": "The Subject of Logic: \u201cSyllogisms\u201d || Aristotelian Deductions and Modern Valid Arguments\n3.2 Aristotelian Deductions and Modern Valid Arguments\n\nDespite its wide generality, Aristotle\u2019s definition of deduction\nis not a precise match for a modern definition of validity. Some of\nthe differences may have important consequences:\n\nAristotle explicitly says that what results of necessity must be\ndifferent from what is supposed. This would rule out arguments in\nwhich the conclusion is identical to one of the premises. Modern\nnotions of validity regard such arguments as valid, though trivially\nso.\nThe plural \u201ccertain things having been supposed\u201d was\ntaken by some ancient commentators to rule out by definition arguments\nwith only one premise, and Aristotle himself says in some places that\nnothing new follows from just one premise.\nThe force of the qualification \u201cbecause of their being\nso\u201d has sometimes been seen as ruling out arguments in which the\nconclusion is not \u2018relevant\u2019 to the premises, e.g.,\narguments in which the premises are inconsistent, arguments with\nconclusions that would follow from any premises whatsoever, or\narguments with superfluous premises.\n\n\nOf these three possible restrictions, the most interesting would be\nthe third. This could be (and has been) interpreted as committing\nAristotle to something like a\n relevance logic.\n In fact, there are passages that appear to confirm this. However,\nthis is too complex a matter to discuss here.\n\nHowever the definition is interpreted, it is clear that Aristotle does\nnot mean to restrict it only to a subset of the valid arguments. This\nis why I have translated sullogismos with\n\u2018deduction\u2019 rather than its English cognate. In modern\nusage, \u2018syllogism\u2019 means an argument of a very specific\nform. Moreover, modern usage distinguishes between valid syllogisms\n(the conclusions of which follow from their premises) and invalid\nsyllogisms (the conclusions of which do not follow from their\npremises). The second of these is inconsistent with Aristotle\u2019s\nuse: since he defines a sullogismos as an argument in which\nthe conclusion results of necessity from the premises, \u201cinvalid\nsullogismos\u201d is a contradiction in terms. The first is\nalso at least highly misleading, since Aristotle does not appear to\nthink that the sullogismoi are simply an interesting subset\nof the valid arguments. Moreover (see below), Aristotle expends great\nefforts to argue that every valid argument, in a broad sense, can be\n\u201creduced\u201d to an argument, or series of arguments, in\nsomething like one of the forms traditionally called a syllogism. If\nwe translate sullogismos as \u201csyllogism\u201d, this\nbecomes the trivial claim \u201cEvery syllogism is a\nsyllogism\u201d,\n",
