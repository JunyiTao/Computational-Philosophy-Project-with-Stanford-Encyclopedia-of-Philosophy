    "main_text": "\n\n\nIf law is a system of enforceable rules governing social relations\nand legislated by a political system, it might seem obvious that law is\nconnected to ideology. Ideology refers, in a general sense, to a system\nof political ideas, and law and politics seem inextricably intertwined.\nJust as ideologies are dotted across the political spectrum, so too are\nlegal systems. Thus we speak of both legal systems and ideologies as\nliberal, fascist, communist, and so on, and most people probably assume\nthat a law is the legal expression of a political ideology. One would\nexpect the practice and activity of law to be shaped by people\u2019s\npolitical beliefs, so law might seem to emanate from ideology in a\nstraightforward and uncontroversial way.\n\n\nHowever, the connection between law and ideology is both complex and\ncontentious. This is because of the diversity of definitions of\nideology, and the various ways in which ideology might be related to\nlaw. Moreover, whilst the observation about law\u2019s link with ideology\nmight seem a sociological commonplace, the link between law and\nideology is more often made in a critical spirit, in order to impugn\nlaw.\n\n\nAt issue is an understanding of ideology as a source of\nmanipulation. Law as ideology directs its subjects in ways that are not\ntransparent to the subjects themselves; law, on this view, cloaks\npower. The ideal of law, in contrast, involves a set of institutions\nthat regulate or restrain power with reference to norms of justice.\nThus the presence of the ideological in law must, in some sense,\ncompromise law\u2019s integrity. Not only is the view of law as ideology at\nodds with a lot of mainstream thinking about law, it seems difficult to\nreconcile with the central philosophical positions on the nature of\nlaw, e.g. a positivist conception of law as a set of formal rules, or a\nnatural law conception where law is identified with moral\nprinciples.\n",
