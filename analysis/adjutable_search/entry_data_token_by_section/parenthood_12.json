    "main_text": "The Morality of Procreation || A Right Not to Procreate?\n3.6 A Right Not to Procreate?\n\nWhile we have set aside the question of abortion, we will briefly\naddress two other cases in which avoiding procreation and parenthood\nhas been taken as protected by procreative autonomy. First is the case\nof legal paternity assignment for the purposes of child support,\nparticularly in the case of \u201cinvoluntary fathers.\u201d Second\nis the case of the disposition of frozen embryos created from the\ngametes of two people who now disagree on their use. We can usefully\ndistinguish rights not to become a gestational parent, not to become a\nlegal parent, and not to become a genetic parent (Cohen 2007, 1140).\nThe cases we are concerned with in this section relate to the two\nlatter (alleged) rights: not to become a legal or a genetic\nparent.\n\nWhile avoiding unwanted paternity has become a topic for the\n\u201cmen\u2019s rights\u201d movement, arguments for a\n\u201cfather\u2019s right to choose\u201d can begin from feminist\ndefenses of procreative autonomy. What is at issue here is not whether\nan unwilling father has the right to compel a pregnant woman to have\nan abortion \u2013 this would be an intolerable invasion of her\nprocreative autonomy \u2013 but whether he should be assigned the\nlegal status, and legal support obligations, of fatherhood. If women\nhave the right to avoid the status and burdens of motherhood, by\nparity of reasoning \u2013 the argument goes \u2013 men should have\nthe right to avoid the status and burdens of fatherhood. Of course,\nthe physical burdens of pregnancy provide a clear disanalogy between\nthe cases (for related legal arguments against arguing from abortion\ncases to genetic parenthood cases, see Cohen 2007). But dismissing the\ncomparison too quickly risks inattention to the costs of \u201cforced\nfatherhood\u201d on worse-off men (and their disproportionate\nenforcement on men of color in the US) (Brake 2005). Some would argue\nthat even if men have the right to avoid involuntary fatherhood\n(especially in cases such as a \u201cpurloined sperm\u201d case, in\nwhich they can deny moral responsibility), the claims of children\noutweigh a right not to become a parent (Overall 2012).\n\nCases of dispute over frozen embroyos, such as Evans v. the United\nKingdom, foreground issues of privacy and control over\none\u2019s genetic material \u2013 especially, whether there is a\nright not to become a genetic parent (again, here we set aside the\nquestion of the moral status of the embryo). In the Evans\ncase, a couple produced embryos through IVF, intending to\nprocreate together, but separated before the embryos could be\nimplanted. Subsequently, the man involved asked that the embryos be\ndestroyed; the law required that both parties consent for the\nprocedure to continue. The woman brought a legal challenge, hoping to\nproceed with implantation.\n\nConsiderations of procreative autonomy, control of one\u2019s genetic\nmaterial, could be brought to bear on either side here. Is there a\nright not to become a genetic parent, and if so, does it override any\nother rights or moral considerations pertinent to such disagreements?\nA right not to become a genetic parent could be grounded in privacy or\nproperty right in one\u2019s genetic material (including\ninformational). But once the embryo is intentionally created with the\nconsent of the gamete donor, it may be argued that any prior property\nclaims are ceded; the genetic contribution cannot be retrieved from\nthis \u201cmiscible joint property\u201d (Chan and Quigley 2007; see\nalso Cohen 2007). On one feminist perspective, the woman who has\nundergone IVF ought to control the embryos, because of the additional\nburdens of the procedure and any future treatments on her (Overall\n1995).\n\nThe resolution to these questions depends, at least in part, on the\nunderlying moral grounds of parenthood. For example, if one acquires\nparental moral obligations by causing a child to exist, that will have\nvery different implications than if one only acquires such obligations\nthrough a voluntary undertaking. The next section will examine such\naccounts of the moral grounds of parenthood.\n",
