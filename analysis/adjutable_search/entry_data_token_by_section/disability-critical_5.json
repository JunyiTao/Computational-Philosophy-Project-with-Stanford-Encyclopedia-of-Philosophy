These phenomena,\nalong with other forms of oppression, thus call for intersectional\nanalysis. This requires the simultaneous investigation of the\nmultiple, intersecting power relationships that affect whole persons\nthrough pathologization, stigma, and exclusion (see the entries on\n feminist perspectives on power\n and\n discrimination;\n see also Crenshaw 1991 for the origin of the term\n\u201cintersectionality\u201d). Intersectional analyses in critical\ndisability studies, including, for example, the work of Nirmala\nErevelles and Andrea Minear (2010) and Fiona Kumari Campbell\u2019s\nanalysis of internalized ableism (2008a), employ and supplement the\nstrategies of critical race theory. Dis/ability Critical Race Studies\n(DisCrit) is deeply engaged in this work. DisCrit finds its primary\nlocation in the field of education but has a wide remit because\nintersections between race and disability appear at diverse sites of\nexperience and oppression.  Theorists tackle topics ranging from\npedagogy (Annamma, Boel\u00e9, Moore, & Klingner 2013) and the\nfamily (Annamma, Ferri, & Connor 2018) to mass incarceration\n(Annamma 2014a and 2014b), immigration (Annamma 2013), and school\nviolence (Watts & Erevelles 2004). They track the pipelines and\ncontinuities among governing institutions to demonstrate how these\nsites interweave to condition the educational experiences of\nracialized, disabled subjects.\n\nConsider the school-to-prison pipeline. Subini Annamma engages\nspatiality and geography in a DisCrit approach to the education\nexperiences of undocumented dis/abled persons, especially young girls,\nwho are caught in this pipeline (2013, 2014a, 2014b, 2017). Annamma,\nwith frequent collaborators David Connor and Beth Ferri, sets the tone\nfor the use of DisCrit in the field of education (Annamma, Connor,\n& Ferri 2013; Annamma, Ferri, & Connor 2018). Their\nwide-ranging edited volume DisCrit: Disability Studies and\nCritical Race Theory in Education presents the work of 21\nscholars on key topics and displays a variety of methodologies and\napplications (Connor, Ferri, & Annamma 2016).\n\nThe \u201cfoundations of DisCrit in Black and critical race feminist\nscholarship and activism\u201d, including Anna Julia Cooper,\nKimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, Patricia Hill Collins, and a variety of\n\u201cintellectual ancestors\u201d such as Angela Davis, bell hooks,\nAudre Lorde, and Sojourner Truth (Annamma, Ferri, and Connor 2018:\n47). Despite the fact that disability was not significantly treated by\nthese ancestral and contemporary Black feminists, the\n\u201cintersectional nature\u201d of this \u201cpioneering\nwork\u201d has nonetheless been foundational to the development of\nDisCrit\u201d (2018: 47\u201348). Taking into account foundational\nclaims in disability studies, including \u201cprivileg[ing] knowledge\nbased on lived experiences of disabled people\u201d (2018: 49) and\ncombining this and other insights from disability studies with work in\ncritical race theory, DisCrit challenges \u201cspecial\neducation\u201d and allows theorists to better \u201cframe and\nanalyze the lives of disabled youth of color\u201d (2018: 49).\n\nAnnamma, Ferri, and Connor provide a thorough lineage of DisCrit and\nreview existing literature (2018). Out of this intensive review of\nthemes and topics, they surface seven foundational tenets of DisCrit\nand include examples in the literature of each. These tenets are as\nfollows: \n\n \u201cDisCrit focuses on ways that the forces of racism and\nableism circulate interdependently, often in neutralized and invisible\nways, to uphold notions of normalcy\u201d (2018: 55); \n \u201cDisCrit values multidimensional identities and troubles\nsingular notions of identity such as race or dis/ability or class or\ngender or sexuality, and so on\u201d (2018: 56);\n \u201cDisCrit emphasizes the social constructions of race and\nability and yet recognizes the material and psychological impacts of\nbeing labeled as raced or dis/abled, which sets one outside of the\nwestern cultural norms\u201d (2018: 57);\n\u201cDisCrit privileges voices of marginalized populations,\ntraditionally not acknowledged within research\u201d (2018: 58);\n\n\u201cDisCrit considers legal and historical aspects of\ndis/ability and race and how both have been used separately and\ntogether to deny the rights of some citizens\u201d (2018: 58);\n \u201cDisCrit recognizes Whiteness and ability as property and\nthat gains for people labeled with dis/abilities have largely been\nmade as the result of interest convergence of White, middle-class\ncitizens\u201d (2018: 60);\n \u201cDisCrit requires activism and supports all forms of\nresistance\u201d (2018: 61).\n\n\nWhile DisCrit literature is growing, with contributions from a circle\nof dedicated scholars, Annamma, Ferri, and Connor note that in their\noriginal field of special education thinkers are largely \u201cquite\nresistant to engage in the racialized nature of education and\ndis/ability in meaningful or sustained ways\u201d (2018: 48). The\nthree are \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that growth in DisCrit\nwill involve more \u201cengagement across disciplines\u201d and\n\u201cstudies that take up all seven tenets in a sustained way\u201d\n(2018: 63).\n\nMeanwhile, Black disability studies has developed a distinct approach\nto pedagogy, advocating for interventions that would shift entire\neducational paradigms and refuse obfuscating, special-topic treatment\nin curricula (Dunhamn et al. 2015). Approaches to disability must\nchange to open up useful racial analysis. For instance, it is\nimpossible, Sami Schalk argues, to theorize the intersection of race\nand disability without considering both disability and\nability. For instance, she argues that disability, \n\n\nin terms of claims of lesser intellectual abilities, was used to\njustify the enslavement of black people, while at the same time an\nunderstanding of black people\u2019s bodies as hyper strong and\nimpervious to heat and pain also justified conditions of slave labor.\nThis racial double bind, to borrow from Marilyn Frye, positioned black\npeople as at once disabled and hyper able and yet suited for slavery\nin both cases. (2017)\n\n\nLiat Ben-Moshe, whose work on incarceration, deinstitutionalization,\nand mad studies supports a number of threads in critical disability\ntheory and significantly intersects with race, has also worked on\nissues of disability in pedagogy and education. Ben-Moshe co-edited\nBuilding Pedagogical Curb Cuts (Ben-Moshe, Cory, Feldbaum,\n& Sagendorf 2005), a text offering resources for accessibility in\nhigher education and integrating disability into curriculum. She has\nattended to the issue of using disability as metaphor in the\nclassroom, suggesting ways to incorporate a critical perspective by\nwhich educators can fruitfully teach the use of disability in\nliterature (2006). Ben-Moshe also co-edited a special issue of\nDisability Studies Quarterly on the topic of\n\u201cInterventions in Disability Studies Pedagogy\u201d (Volume 35,\nNo. 2). In the introduction to this issue, Ben-Moshe writes, \u201cI\nperceive Disability Studies as missionary work and much of my pedagogy\nis the work of conversion\u201d. In describing conversion, Ben-Moshe\nrefers to access but also \u201cconverting students to understanding\ndisability intersectionally, as an identity and a culture\u201d\n(Ben-Moshe, Day, Ferris, & Nielsen [eds] 2015).\n",
