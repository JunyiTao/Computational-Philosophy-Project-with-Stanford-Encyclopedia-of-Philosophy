    "main_text": "Speaking of Evil\n1. Speaking of Evil\n\n\u201cEvil\u201d and related terms in the Germanic branch of\nIndo-European have referred, at various points, to suffering and\nwrongdoing, but also to defecation, latrines, spoiled fruit, diseases,\nprostitution, and (oddly enough) forks.\n\nThe Greek term \u201ckakos\u201d may be related to the\nProto-Indo-European term\n\u201ckakka\u201d\u2014\u201cdefecation\u201d. But only\nthe first two meanings survive in English, and non-ironic uses of the\nterm are relatively rare outside of ceremonial and literary contexts.\nIndeed, speaking of evil nowadays often feels like an exercise in\nanachronism\u2014like speaking of wickedness, abomination,\nuncleanness, and iniquity.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary explains:\n\n\nIn modern colloquial English it [evil]; is little used, such\ncurrency as it has being due to literary influence. In quite familiar\nspeech the adjective is commonly superseded by bad; the noun\nis somewhat more frequent, but chiefly in the widest senses, the more\nspecific senses being expressed by other words, such as harm,\ninjury, misfortune, disease, etc.\n(\u201cevil, adj. and n.1\u201d, under A.,\nabbreviations expanded, OED Online, accessed September\n2021)\n\n\nThis trend is found in other modern languages, but not in all. Ruppel\n(2019) notes that in German-speaking lands \u201cdas\n\u00dcbel\u201d declined just like \u201cevil\u201d did in\nEngland, but was soon replaced by \u201cdas\nB\u00f6se\u201d, which is still alive and well in Germany.\n\nThis slow erasure of \u201cevil\u201d and its cognates from many\nEuropean languages, which began in the seventeenth century, was due to\nthe rejection of the concept of evil, especially by elites.\nDoctors, moral philosophers, natural scientists, and even theologians\nshied away from evil\u2014preferring more tractable notions\nlike badness, harm, and misfortune, or\nquasi-quantifiable concepts like pain, suffering,\ntrauma, and\ndisutility. Traditional views of ontologically substantive\nand supernatural evil\u2014something able to possess a body or\nterrorize a soul\u2014came to be seen as quaint, unscientific,\nembarrassing (Ruppel 2019).\n\nPhilosophers of religion are a half-exception to the rule. They did\nand do continue to speak of evil, at least when discussing the\n\u201cproblem\u201d thereof. (See the entry on\n the problem of evil.) If pressed, though, they typically\nadmit that this is because the great framers of the\nproblem\u2014Augustine, Aquinas, Leibniz, Bayle\u2014used the term\n(in Latin or French), and then proceed to gloss it generically as, in\nMichael Tooley\u2019s words, \u201cany undesirable states of\naffairs\u201d (2002 [2019]). Philosophers of religion in the broadly\nContinental tradition are less likely to assimilate evil to more\ngeneral or anodyne notions in this way, and more likely to discuss the\nnature of evil as opposed to the \u201cproblem\u201d it raises for\ntheism (e.g., Kearney 2001 and Matu\u0161t\u00edk 2008).\n\nDespite this widespread squeamishness about \u201cevil\u201d in both\nscientific culture and common parlance, there are moments when the\npull of the ancient lexicon is irresistible\u2014at the very least\nexpressively, in the mode of both condemnation and lament.\nPremeditated mass shootings aren\u2019t just bad or traumatic;\nrather, they are something else: here people still reach for\n\u201cevil\u201d or even \u201cradical evil\u201d. The years-long\nimprisonment and rape of children by their parents is a misfortune\nthat produces negative utility, to be sure, but the transfixing horror\nof it seems only to be captured by the invocation of\n\u201cevil\u201d. The same is true of most instances of genocide,\nsex-trafficking, torture-slaying, terrorism, serial killing, and\nslavery: these are one and all bad, harmful, and traumatic activities,\nbut they are also something else\u2014something excessive,\nmesmerizing, and revolting all at once (see Stone 2009 for a\npsychologist\u2019s account). In the face of such acts,\nwe\u2014along with our spiritual leaders, newscasters, and\npoliticians\u2014are still willing to speak, preach, and tweet about\n\u201cpure evil\u201d.\n\nThus after a school shooting in February 2017, Donald Trump\n(@realDonaldTrump) tweeted that \u201cwe must keep \u2018evil\u2019\nout of our country\u201d. (Despite the quotation marks, it was clear\nthat he meant evil the entity, and not \u201cevil\u201d the word.)\nAfter the Las Vegas mass shooting in October 2017, Trump and many\nothers in leadership referred to the event as \u201can act of pure\nevil\u201d (Matuson 2017). Less recently, George W. Bush referred to\nIran, Iraq, and North Korea as the \u201cAxis of Evil\u201d in a\nstate of the union address on 29 January 2002 (see Other Internet\nResources), and Ronald Reagan repeatedly characterized the Soviet\nUnion as \u201cthe evil empire\u201d, famously at a speech on 8\nMarch 1983 to the National Association of Evangelicals (see Other\nInternet Resources).\n\nBut when we do this\u2014when we speak of evil, das\nB\u00f6se, il male nowadays\u2014what is it\nthat we are referring to, and where does it come from?\n\nPressed with such questions, many people (philosophers included)\nrevert to the more tractable terms. Of course what we are\nreally talking about (whispering about, thundering about, shaking our\nheads about) in those moments of condemnation and lament is an extreme\ninstance of suffering or disutility. Of course\n\u201cevil\u201d is to \u201cbad\u201d what \u201cwicked\u201d\nis to \u201cimmoral\u201d: a conceptual vestige of a pre-scientific,\ncredulous past that we invoke for the sake of solemnity, empathy, or\nemphasis. A concept that\u2014outside of horror films and\nfiction\u2014is best analyzed in terms of nature\u2019s frustration\nof the basic needs of sentient creatures, or as the effects of illness\nand ill-parenting. Yes, evil happenings have an excessive, egregious\nquality that makes them notable, even transfixing. But they are not,\nin the end, sui generis or metaphysically mysterious:\nneuroscience, medicine, psychology, and law have domesticated evil.\nTaken to its logical extreme, the doctrine that characterizes this\ncamp would be that all evil is \u201cnatural\u201d (a\nproduct of various causal processes in nature).\n\nOthers prefer to answer the questions about the origins of evil in\nterms of choice, agency, and will. For people in\nthis camp, evil consists in malevolent intentions, malice with\nforethought, and self-conscious cruelty that leads to extreme\nsuffering and tribulation. They may allow that there are contributing\nfactors and preconditions, but ultimately hold the agents\nthemselves responsible for evil. Note, however, that the appeal\nto human free will can also be seen as an effort to domesticate\nevil\u2014to make it explicable in terms of familiar concepts, to set\nit on a continuum with other, familiar acts and events. Taken to its\nlogical extreme, the doctrine held by people in this camp is that\nall evil has \u201cmoral\u201d origins\u2014it is a\nproduct of choice or agency of some sort.\n\nThis debate about the roots of evil plays out not only in philosophy\nseminar rooms and psychology labs, but also on cable news stations and\nop-ed pages. People in the second camp tend to the political right,\nand sometimes even make a show of using \u201cevil\u201d because\nthey think that people in the first camp (who tend to the political\nleft) are uncomfortable with the idea of personal responsibility and\nblameworthiness.\n\nI said these were the two opposing camps. In truth there is\nanother one\u2014one that used to be very popular but now seems\nsparsely populated, at least among philosophers. People in this third\ncamp eschew efforts to domesticate evil; for them, what we mean by\n\u201cevil\u201d is not equivalent to what we mean by\n\u201cbad\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d or even \u201cvery very very\nbad\u201d or \u201cvery very very wrong\u201d. In other words, evil\nis not just illness, misfortune, or malevolent choices by another name\nbut rather a positive, substantial rottenness in the universe. It is,\nor has its origin in, some non-agential force or shadow side of\nreality\u2014something spooky, imperceptible, but out there\n(\u201cin them woods\u201d).\n",
