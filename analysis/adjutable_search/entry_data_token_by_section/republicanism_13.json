    "main_text": "The Contemporary Republican Program || Republican Political Institutions\n4.2 Republican Political Institutions\n\nTurning from questions of public policy to the form of government, we\nreturn to issues more familiar to the writers in the classical\ntradition. Protecting citizens from the arbitrary or uncontrolled\npower of their government through good institutional design represents\nperhaps the signature classical republican concern. Many of the\nstandard devices for achieving this aim\u2014the rule of law, the\nseparation of powers, federalism, constitutionally entrenched basic\nrights, and so on\u2014have been adopted by liberals and others.\nContemporary civic republicans, naturally, remain committed to these\ninstitutional devices in some measure (Pettit 1997, 2012, 2014; Maynor\n2003).\n\nHowever, contemporary civic republicans also recognize that these\nsorts of devices can only go so far. The basic reason for this is\nthat, no matter how carefully designed, the operation and functioning\nof government necessarily entails considerable discretion on the part\nof public authorities (Pettit 1997; Richardson 2002). There are two\nespecially prominent instances of this. First, it is clear that no\nmatter how detailed and carefully-crafted it is, no system of explicit\nrules and regulations can possibly cover all contingencies and\ncircumstances. It follows that discretionary authority must inevitably\nbe left in the hands of courts, public agencies, and administrative\nbureaucracies. Second, even apart from this, there remains extensive\ndiscretion in the hands of legislatures to set public law and policy\nin the first place. A daily-changing system of rules is no better than\nhaving no rules at all.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe standard republican remedy for this problem is enhanced democracy.\nIt must, however, be democracy of the right sort. Most contemporary\ncivic republicans reject the populist model of democracy according to\nwhich all public laws and policies must express the collective will of\nthe people in order to be considered legitimate. Instead, they\ngenerally endorse some form of \u201cqualified populism\u201d\n(Richardson 2002) or \u201ccontestatory democracy\u201d (Pettit\n1997, 1999, 2001; Maynor 2003). Roughly speaking, the idea is that\nproperly-designed democratic institutions should give citizens the\neffective opportunity to contest the decisions of their\nrepresentatives. This possibility of contestation will make government\nagents wielding discretionary authority answerable to a public\nunderstanding of the goals or ends they are meant to serve and the\nmeans they are permitted to employ. In this way, discretionary power\ncan be subject to popular control in the sense required for a secure\nenjoyment of republican liberty (Pettit 2012, 2014; Ingham 2019).\n\nNext, of course, we will want to know how popular control might\nactually be put into practice. The main challenges are commonly\naddressed under three headings, outlined by Pettit (1997,\n186\u20137). The first and most thoroughly discussed is the\nrequirement that discretionary authority be guided by the norm of\ndeliberative public reasoning. This means that the relevant\ndecision-makers (legislatures, courts, bureaucrats, etc.) must be\nrequired to present reasons for their decisions, and those reasons\nmust be subject to open public debate (see Sunstein 1988, 1993; Pettit\n1997; Richardson 2002). So, for example, legislative processes should\nbe designed so as to discourage back-room bargaining on the basis of\nsectional interests, and instead to encourage open public\ndeliberation. Similarly, bureaucratic agencies should not be allowed\nto merely issue determinations on the basis of technocratic expertise\nwithout offering reasons for their decisions that are open to public\nexamination.\n\nThe other two requirements have not received as much attention as the\nfirst, perhaps because both are relatively obvious. The second is that\nof inclusiveness. Opportunities for democratic contestation must be\nequally open to all persons and groups in the society. This\nrequirement follows naturally from a universalized concern for\nrepublican liberty, and it has implications for the design of\nrepresentative institutions, campaign financing, and so on (Pettit\n1997, 2012; Bellamy 2007). And the third requirement is that there\nexist institutionalized forums for contestation\u2014impartial\n\u2018courts of appeal,\u2019 so to speak, where citizens can raise\nobjections to public laws and policies (Pettit 1997, 1999, 2012).\nWhether these forums should include constitutional courts with strong\npowers of judicial review remains a subject of debate in the\nrepublican literature, however (Bellamy 2007; Honohan 2009; Hickey\n2019).\n",
