Limiting the Demands of Morality\n\nAnother popular charge is that classic utilitarianism demands too\nmuch, because it requires us to do acts that are or should be moral\noptions (neither obligatory nor forbidden). (Scheffler 1982) For\nexample, imagine that my old shoes are serviceable but dirty, so I\nwant a new pair of shoes that costs $100. I could wear my old shoes\nand give the $100 to a charity that will use my money to save someone\nelse\u2019s life. It would seem to maximize utility for me to give\nthe $100 to the charity. If it is morally wrong to do anything other\nthan what maximizes utility, then it is morally wrong for me to buy\nthe shoes. But buying the shoes does not seem morally wrong. It might\nbe morally better to give the money to charity, but such contributions\nseem supererogatory, that is, above and beyond the call of duty. Of\ncourse, there are many more cases like this. When I watch television,\nI always (or almost always) could do more good by helping others, but\nit does not seem morally wrong to watch television. When I choose to\nteach philosophy rather than working for CARE or the Peace Corps, my\nchoice probably fails to maximize utility overall. If we were required\nto maximize utility, then we would have to make very different choices\nin many areas of our lives. The requirement to maximize utility, thus,\nstrikes many people as too demanding because it interferes with the\npersonal decisions that most of us feel should be left up to the\nindividual.\n\nSome utilitarians respond by arguing that we really are morally\nrequired to change our lives so as to do a lot more to increase\noverall utility (see Kagan 1989, P. Singer 1993, and Unger 1996). Such\nhard-liners claim that most of what most people do is morally wrong,\nbecause most people rarely maximize utility. Some such wrongdoing\nmight be blameless when agents act from innocent or even desirable\nmotives, but it is still supposed to be moral wrongdoing. Opponents of\nutilitarianism find this claim implausible, but it is not obvious that\ntheir counter-utilitarian intuitions are reliable or well-grounded\n(Murphy 2000, chs. 1\u20134; cf. Mulgan 2001, Singer 2005, Greene\n2013).\n\nOther utilitarians blunt the force of the demandingness objection by\nlimiting direct utilitarianism to what people morally ought\nto do. Even if we morally ought to maximize utility, it need not be\nmorally wrong to fail to maximize utility. John Stuart Mill, for\nexample, argued that an act is morally wrong only when both\nit fails to maximize utility and its agent is liable to punishment for\nthe failure (Mill 1861). It does not always maximize utility to punish\npeople for failing to maximize utility. Thus, on this view, it is not\nalways morally wrong to fail to do what one morally ought to do. If\nMill is correct about this, then utilitarians can say that we ought to\ngive much more to charity, but we are not required or obliged to do\nso, and failing to do so is not morally wrong (cf. Sinnott-Armstrong\n2005).\n\nMany utilitarians still want to avoid the claim that we morally ought\nto give so much to charity. One way around this claim uses a\nrule-utilitarian theory of what we morally ought to do. If it costs\ntoo much to internalize rules implying that we ought to give so much\nto charity, then, according to such rule-utilitarianism, it is not\ntrue that we ought to give so much to charity (Hooker 2000, ch.\n8).\n\nAnother route follows an agent-relative theory of value. If there is\nmore value in benefiting oneself or one\u2019s family and friends\nthan there is disvalue in letting strangers die (without killing\nthem), then spending resources on oneself or one\u2019s family and\nfriends would maximize the good. A problem is that such\nconsequentialism would seem to imply that we morally ought not to\ncontribute those resources to charity, although such contributions\nseem at least permissible.\n\nMore personal leeway could also be allowed by deploying the legal\nnotion of proximate causation. When a starving stranger would stay\nalive if and only if one contributed to a charity, contributing to the\ncharity still need not be the proximate cause of the stranger\u2019s\nlife, and failing to contribute need not be the proximate cause of his\nor her death. Thus, if an act is morally right when it includes the\nmost net good in its proximate consequences, then it might not be\nmorally wrong either to contribute to the charity or to fail to do so.\nThis potential position, as mentioned above, has not yet been\ndeveloped, as far as I know.\n\nYet another way to reach this conclusion is to give up maximization\nand to hold instead that we morally ought to do what creates enough\nutility. This position is often described as satisficing\nconsequentialism (Slote 1984). According to satisficing\nconsequentialism, it is not morally wrong to fail to contribute to a\ncharity if one contributes enough to other charities and if the money\nor time that one could contribute does create enough good, so it is\nnot just wasted. (For criticisms, see Bradley 2006.) A related\nposition is progressive consequentialism, which holds that we\nmorally ought to improve the world or make it better than it would be\nif we did nothing, but we don\u2019t have to improve it as much as we\ncan (Elliot and Jamieson, 2009). Both satisficing and progressive\nconsequentialism allow us to devote some of our time and money to\npersonal projects that do not maximize overall good.\n\nA more radical set of proposals confines consequentialism to\njudgements about how good an act is on a scale (Norcross 2006, 2020)\nor to degrees of wrongness and rightness (Sinhababu 2018). This\npositions are usually\u00a0described as scalar\nconsequentialism. A scalar consequentialist can refuse to say\nwhether it is absolutely right or wrong to give $1000 to charity, for\nexample, but still say that giving $1000 to charity is better and more\nright than giving only $100 and simultaneously worse and more wrong\nthan giving $10,000. A related contrastivist consequentialism\ncould say that one ought to give $1000 in contrast with $100 but not\nin contrast with $10,000 (cf. Snedegar 2017).\u00a0Such positions can\nalso hold that less or less severe negative sanctions are justified\nwhen an agent\u2019s act is worse than a smaller set of alternatives\ncompared to when the agent\u2019s act is worse than a larger set of\nalternatives. This approach then becomes less demanding, both because\nit sees less negative sanctions as justified when the agent fails to\ndo the best act possible, and also because it avoids saying that\neveryday actions are simply wrong without comparison to any set of\nalternatives.\n\nOpponents still object that all such consequentialist theories are\nmisdirected. When I decide to visit a friend instead of working for a\ncharity, I can know that my act is not immoral even if I have not\ncalculated that the visit will create enough overall good or that it\nwill improve the world. These critics hold that friendship requires us\nto do certain favors for friends without weighing our friends\u2019\nwelfare impartially against the welfare of strangers. Similarly, if I\nneed to choose between saving my drowning wife and saving a drowning\nstranger, it would be \u201cone thought too many\u201d (Williams\n1981) for me to calculate the consequences of each act. I morally\nshould save my wife straightaway without calculating utilities.\n\nIn response, utilitarians can remind critics that the principle of\nutility is intended as only a criterion of right and not as a decision\nprocedure, so utilitarianism does not imply that people ought to\ncalculate utilities before acting (Railton 1984). Consequentialists\ncan also allow the special perspective of a friend or spouse to be\nreflected in agent-relative value assessments (Sen 1982, Broome 1991,\nPortmore 2001, 2003) or probability assessments (Jackson 1991). It\nremains controversial, however, whether any form of consequentialism\ncan adequately incorporate common moral intuitions about\nfriendship.\n",
