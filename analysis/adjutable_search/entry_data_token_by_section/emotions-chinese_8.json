    "main_text": "Interpretations of Qing || Qing as the Inputs from Reality\n3.2 Qing as the Inputs from Reality\n\nIn Hansen\u2019s non-belief or non-doxastic approach to Chinese\nphilosophy, specifically to Chinese epistemology and philosophy of\nmind in pre-Buddhist period, qing is an intriguing example of\nsemantic duality. He (1995: 182) discusses two different, almost\nopposite definitions of qing in a typical Chinese English\ndictionary. \n\n\nA typical Chinese-English dictionary\u2026has two entries under\nqingfeeling: The first is \u201caffections, the\nfeelings, desires\u201d; translations of character compounds under\nthis meaning include love, desire, emotion,\nand sentiment. The second definition is \u201ccircumstances;\nfacts of a case\u201d; examples of compounds under this meaning\ninclude truth, situation, reason,\norigin, real facts. \n\n\nHe (1995) characterizes this semantic duality of qing as an\nintriguing combination of the two contrastive properties of\nqing: qing is understood partially as a subjective\ninner state and partially as an objective and external state of\naffairs. He argues that the two meanings of qing poses a\nconceptual conflict only under the exclusive and dichotomous schemes\nof Western philosophy, i.e., the distinction between the\ninner-subjective-psychological mind and the outer-objective-material\nworld and the contrastive or confrontational relation between emotion\nand reason. He states (1995: 183) that \n\n\nChinese views of language, mind, and action do not center on an inner\nsubjectivity or a conception of a mental/intellectual world populated\nby mental/intellectual objects set off against an external world of\nphysical objects or matter. Nor do they make the familiar\nIndo-European faculty and functional distinction between cognitive and\naffective states. A single faculty/organ, the\nxinheart-mind, guides action rather than separate\nfaculties of heart and mind.\n\n\nFrom the viewpoint of these dichotomies, the semantic duality of\nqing becomes puzzling or confusing. However, if, as Hansen\nargues, Chinese philosophy does not subscribe the dichotomies of\nsubjectivity-objectivity and emotion-reason, one can find a way to\ncombine the two meanings of qing in a consistent and\nmeaningful manner. Following this unique Chinese approach to language,\nmind and action, Hansen explains how different meanings of\nqing coexist in Chinese philosophy. According to him (1995:\n196), qing, in early Chinese philosophy, should be understood\nas \u201cthe inputs from reality\u201d or \u201creality\ninduced discrimination or distinction-making reactions\u201d such as\ndark-light, left-right, sweet-sour-salty-bitter, and high-low pitch.\nThat is, qing refers to the inputs from our reaction or\ninteraction with reality. From this broad meaning of qing,\none can understand, as Hansen argues, how qing is discussed\nin early Chinese texts. On the basis of this interpretation of\nqing, he argues that the semantic transition from\nqingreality to qingemotion can\nbe explained by the introduction of Buddhism to Chinese philosophy. He\n(1995: 183) states that \n\n\nI implicitly accept the possibility that the introduction of Buddhism\nimported an Indo-European psychological theory and thus introduced new\ntheoretical roles for qingfeelings and\nyudesire. \n\n\nHansen argues that, with the introduction of Buddhism, Chinese\nphilosophers found a way to understand the mind from the perspective\nof the inner, subjective, representational states, and this\npsychological viewpoint of Buddhism facilitated the development of a\nnew semantic dimension of qing (i.e., qing as\nsubjective feelings) in Chinese philosophy.\n",
