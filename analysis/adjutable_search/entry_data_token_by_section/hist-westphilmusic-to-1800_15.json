    "main_text": "Early Modern Period || The Primacy of Melody: Rousseau\n3.5 The Primacy of Melody: Rousseau\n\nMusic was a lifelong concern for Jean-Jacques Rousseau\n(1712\u20131778), whose musical writings touch on an impressive\nvariety of topics, from music notation and theory to core\nphilosophical concerns such as musical value and expressiveness.\nRousseau was also the author of a remarkably successful opera, Le\nDevin du Village (1752), performed around four hundred times over\nthe course of the fifty years following its premiere.\n\nA contributor to Diderot and D\u2019Alembert\u2019s\nEncyclop\u00e9die (1751), Rousseau embarked on a systematic\nrejection of the views defended by Jean-Philippe Rameau\n(1683\u20131764), the leading music theorist at the time.\nRousseau\u2019s rejection of Rameau was not simply a rejection of his\nmusic theory, but rather of the entire musical practice it was\nsupposed to justify, that is, French music of the time.\n\nRousseau\u2019s Letter on French Music (1753) may be seen as\nan episode in the so-called querelle des bouffons, a dispute\nconcerning the relative merits of Italian and French opera that was\nprompted by the 1752 Paris performance of Giovanni Battista\nPergolesi\u2019s La serva padrona. In the Letter,\nRousseau takes the side of Italian music, holding that its superiority\nover French music is ultimately due to the Italian language, which is\nmore melodious and better articulated than French. French music\nattempts to address the shortcoming of its language by adopting\ncomplex harmonic structures, but Rousseau believes that this only\nfurther hinders its expressive potential. He observes how Italian\nmusic is more moving not in spite of its use of chords that are not\ncompletely filled out, but precisely because of this feature. In the\nLetter, Rousseau also develops the principle of \u201cunity\nof melody\u201d (unit\u00e9 de m\u00e9lodie), according\nto which music ought to present the listener with one single salient\nmelody at any time, the other voices playing a subsidiary and\nsupportive role. It is from this melodic unity that music derives its\ncapacity to move the listener, and in this resides music\u2019s\nvalue. The concept of unity of melody is further elaborated in a\ndedicated entry of Rousseau\u2019s Dictionary of Music\n(1768), where he also states that his Devin du Village was an\nattempt to put that principle into practice (Rousseau 1768,\n\u201cUnity of Melody\u201d; on unity of melody, see Riley 2004:\nchapter 2, and Waeber 2009).\n\nRousseau\u2019s polemical view of harmony as a hindrance to melodic\ndevelopment, as well as the consequent condemnation of French music,\nfound a natural target in Rameau, who defended himself on various\noccasions (Rameau\u2019s responses are collected in Scott 1998; on\nthe debate, see Verba 2016: chapters 2 and 3). In his\nTrait\u00e9 de l\u2019harmonie (1722), Rameau had already\nstated that melody is merely a part of harmony, and in his subsequent\nNouveau syst\u00e8me de musique th\u00e9orique, he had\nattempted to ground the tonal system in the phenomenon of upper\npartial harmonics, the faint overtones that are produced whenever any\nnote is struck. This means that there is strictly speaking no pure\nmelody, as no note is ever heard in isolation from the harmonics it\ngenerates. The ascending series of upper harmonics, Rameau argues,\ncontains the key to tonal harmony. In his Encyclop\u00e9die\narticle \u201cDissonance\u201d, Rousseau accepts that harmony may be\npartly grounded in the structure of the harmonic series, but presses\nRameau on the origin of the minor third, an interval that is as\ncrucial to tonal harmony as it is absent from the series. More\nimportant than these technical qualms is Rousseau\u2019s fundamental\nmethodological difference from Rameau. While Rameau\u2019s musical\naesthetics depends on a theory of music including mathematical and\nphysical constructs inaccessible from the mere experience of\nlistening, Rousseau considers such experience the ultimate judge of\nmusical value, and holds that it points to melody as the part of music\nthat is responsible for its emotional impact on the listener (see\nO\u2019Dea 1995: 19\u201320). Insofar as it concerns the appropriate\nlevel of explanation of musical phenomena, the contrast between\nRousseau and Rameau is not unlike the one between Aristoxenian and\nPythagorean approaches to harmonics (see\n \u00a71.2).\n\nRousseau\u2019s views on the expressive power of music are further\nelaborated in his Essay on the Origin of Languages (1781), in\nwhich he argues that music and natural languages developed out of a\ncommon source, a language used for the expression of feelings\n(Rousseau 1781: chapter XII, \u201cOrigin of music\u201d; see Thomas\n1995: chapter 5). Following this common origin, both language and\nmusic underwent a process of decay. Languages developed in order to\ncommunicate increasingly complex thoughts, but lost expressive power,\nespecially after the emergence of writing (Rousseau 1781: chapters\nV\u2013VI). Thus, Plato\u2019s Greece, Rousseau states, had no\nshortage of philosophers, but lacked musicians (Rousseau 1781: chapter\nXIX). Regarding this remark, Martinelli (2012 [2019: 62])\nobserves:\n\n\nAnticipating the line of reasoning that would later be adopted by\nNietzsche, Rousseau openly contrasted music and philosophy, strongly\nundermining the tradition that saw them as sisters.\n\n\nAccording to Rousseau, music degenerated along with language and\ngradually lost its original expressive power. This happened as free\nmelodic phrases progressively turned into regimented musical systems,\nin which harmony and counterpoint were introduced in order to\ncompensate for the loss of natural melody (Rousseau 1781: chapter\nXIX).\n\nIt is tempting, though perhaps imprecise, to see in Rousseau\u2019s\nview a precursor of the musilanguage hypothesis, recently proposed by\nSteven Brown (1999; on this, see Waeber 2013; Mithen 2005 advances a\nview similar to Brown\u2019s).\n\nAs is apparent from his hypothesis concerning the origins of music,\nRousseau thinks that the expression of emotions is music\u2019s main\nfunction. A qualified notion of imitation plays a crucial role in\nthis. While Rousseau accepts the eighteenth century view of art as\nimitation (Rousseau 1768, \u201cImitation\u201d), he is also clear\nin stating that musical imitation is different from the kinds we find\nin other art forms. Music does not imitate the human passions or other\nobjects by presenting us with their sonic equivalent, but rather by\narousing in the listener the emotions that the object would give rise\nto. In Rousseau\u2019s words,\n\n\nIt will not represent these things directly, but will arouse the same\nmovements in the soul that are experienced in seeing them. (Rousseau\n1768, \u201cImitation\u201d)\n\n\nIt is because of this that musical imitation is not confined to one\nsense modality. If painting may represent only objects of sight,\n\n\n[m]usic would seem to have the same limits with respect to hearing;\nnevertheless, it portrays everything, even objects which are only\nvisible: by an almost inconceivable magic trick it seems to put the\neye in the ear, and the greatest marvel of an Art that acts only by\nmotion is to be able to form even the image of rest. Night, sleep,\nsolitude, and silence are counted among Music\u2019s great portraits.\n(Rousseau 1768, \u201cImitation\u201d; similar claims on musical\nimitation are made elsewhere in Rousseau\u2019s oeuvre, see Rousseau\n1768, \u201cOpera\u201d, and Rousseau 1781: chapter XVI)\n\n\nEffectively, the imitation that Rousseau considers central to music is\nthe arousal of an emotion that is specific enough to be associated\nwith a given object. Thus, while Rousseau is not skeptical with regard\nto music\u2019s capacity to imitate worldly objects, he is able to\ndefend this view because he redefines imitation in terms of emotional\narousal. In this sense, he is still representative of a progressive\nshift away from a view of music as imitation.\n\nDespite its charm, Rousseau\u2019s view of musical imitation does not\nseem to withstand critical scrutiny. It is unconvincing as an\nexplanation of the musical imitation of emotions. It may be though\nthat an emotion we perceive always corresponds to another emotion we\nfeel, and thus that we could depict the former by arousing the latter.\nBut in fact, we may respond to, e.g., rage with a variety of emotions,\nfrom more rage, to fear, disappointment, schadenfreude, etc. The\ntheory is only more implausible when it comes to the depiction of\nobjects other than emotions, as the same object may arouse very\ndifferent emotions, depending on the subject\u2019s disposition and\nbeliefs about it.\n",
