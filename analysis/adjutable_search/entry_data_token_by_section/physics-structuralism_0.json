    "main_text": "Other structuralisms\n1. Other structuralisms\n\nThe term \u2018structuralism\u2019 is used with different meanings\nand therefore it seems appropriate to mention other\n\u2018structuralisms\u2019 and to explain how \u2018structuralism\nin physics\u2019 is related to them. If you check the entry \u2018structuralism (disambiguation)\u2019 in Wikipedia,\nyou will be informed that there is a spectrum of\n\u2018structuralisms\u2019 in 11 different areas, including:\n\nlinguistics [F. de Saussure (1857\u20131913)],\nanthropology [C. L\u00e9vi-Strauss (1908\u20132009)],\nmathematics [N. Bourbaki (1935\u2013), collective\npseudonym],\nphilosophy of science [J. D. Sneed (1938\u2013), W.\nStegm\u00fcller (1923\u20131991)].\n\n\nHere we have mentioned some prominent representatives in brackets. All\ntypes of structuralism share a common conviction about the r\u00f4le\nof structures in their respective disciplines, but at first glance\nthey show little similarity. Nevertheless, there are connections and\nmutual influences between the different structuralisms. It goes beyond\nthe scope of this entry to examine these influences in more detail.\nFor the relations between anthropologic and mathematical structuralism\nsee Aubin (1997). As mentioned, we will understand\n\u2018structuralism in physics\u2019 as a special case of\n\u2018structuralism in philosophy of science\u2019. There are close\nconnections with mathematical structuralism, which we will discuss in\nmore detail in the main part of this entry. To illustrate these\nconnections here we only mention the full title of Stegm\u00fcller\n(1979a): The structuralist view of theories, A possible analogue of\nthe Bourbaki programme in physical science.\n\nRight now, we are taking the interim balance that \u2018Structuralism\nin Physics\u2019 is part of an intellectual movement mainly in the\n20th century and, compared to other structuralisms, represents a\nrather late contribution.\n",
