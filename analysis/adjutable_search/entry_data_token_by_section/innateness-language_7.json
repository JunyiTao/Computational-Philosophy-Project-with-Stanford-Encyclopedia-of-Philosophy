    "main_text": "Other Research Bearing on the Innateness of Language: New Problems for the Nativist? || The Critical Period for Language Acquisition\n3.3 The Critical Period for Language Acquisition\n\n\nLenneberg (1964, 1967) also argued that although language acquisition\nis remarkably robust, in the sense that all normal (and many \nabnormal) children do it, it can occur unproblematically only during \na \u2018critical period\u2019 \u2014 roughly, up to late childhood\nor early puberty. On analogy with other supposedly innately specified\nprocesses like imprinting or visual development, Lenneberg used the \nexistence of a critical period as further evidence that language \npossesses a proprietary basis in biology.\n\n\nIn support of the critical period hypothesis about language, \nLenneberg cited the facts (i) that retarded (e.g., Downs syndrome) \nchildren's language development stops around puberty; (ii) that \nwhereas very young children are able to (re)learn language after \naphasias produced by massive left-hemisphere trauma (including \nhemispherectomy), aphasias in older children and adults are typically\nnot reversible; and (iii) that so-called \u2018wild children,\u2019\nviz., those who grow up with no or little exposure to human language,\nexhibit severely compromised language skills. (Lenneberg, \n1957:142-55; see Curtiss 1977 for the (in)famous case of Genie, a \nmodern-day \u2018wild child\u2019 from suburban Los Angeles, who \nwas unable to acquire any but the most rudimentary grammatical \ncompetence after a miserable and wordless childhood spent locked \nalone in a room, tied to her potty chair or bed.)\n\n\nAs further support for the critical period hypothesis, others have \nadded the observation that although children are able to learn a \nsecond language rapidly and to native speaker fluency, adult learners\nof second languages typically are not: the capacity to learn a second\nlanguage tapers off after puberty, no matter how much exposure to the\nlanguage one has. (Newport 1990). Thus, it was speculated, the \ninnate knowledge base for language learning (e.g., knowledge of UG) \nbecomes unavailable for normal acquisition at puberty, and adult \nlearners must rely on less efficient learning methods. (Johnson and \nNewport 1989.)\n\n\nAs a preliminary to discussing these arguments (many of which are \npresented in more detailed in Stromswold 2000) it is worth \ndistinguishing two notions that often get conflated under the name \n\u2018critical period\u2019:\n\n\nCritical Period: a time during development which is \nliterally critical; the relevant competence either cannot \ndevelop or will be permanently lost unless certain inputs are \nreceived during that period.\n\nSensitive Period: a time during development in which a \ncompetence is acquired \u2018normally,\u2019 or \n\u2018easily,\u2019 or \u2018naturally.\u2019 The competence can \nbe acquired outside the sensitive period, but perhaps less easily and\nnaturally, and or perhaps with less ultimate success.\n\n\n\nThe classic example of a critical period is due to the Nobel \nprize-winning work of Hubel and Wiesel. By suturing shut one of a \nkitten's eyes at various stages of development and for various \nperiods of time, Hubel and Wiesel (1970) showed that certain cortical\nand thalamic areas supporting binocular vision (specifically, ocular \ndominance \n columns[20]\n and cells in the lateral geniculate body) will not develop normally \nunless kittens receive patterned visual stimulation during the 4th to\n12th weeks of life. They found that while the damage was sometimes \nreversible to some extent, depending on the exact duration and timing\nof the occlusion, occlusion for the entire first three months of life\nproduced irreversible blindness in the deprived \n eye.[21]\n\n\n\nLanguage, however, is not like this. As we will see, there is little \nevidence for a critical period for language acquisition, \nalthough there is considerable evidence that there is a sensitive\nperiod during which language is acquired more easily. The \nimplications of this for claims about the innateness of language will\nbe addressed in \u00a73.3.4.\n3.3.1 Language recovery after trauma\n\n\nLenneberg cited the superior ability of children to (re)learn \nlanguage after left brain injury in support of the critical period \nhypothesis. But while there clearly is a difference between the \nabilities of young children, on the one hand, and older children and \nadults, on the other, to recover from left brain insults, the contrast \nin recovery course and outcome is not as stark as is often supposed.\n\n\nFirst, older children \u2014 even those who have not succeeded in \nlearning language previously \u2014 can substantially recover from \nleft hemisphere trauma occurring well after the supposed closure of \nthe \u2018sensitive\u2019 or \u2018critical\u2019 period; in \neffect, they learn language from scratch as adolescents. \nVargha-Khadem et al. 1997, for instance, report the case of Alex, \nwho failed to speak at all during childhood and whose receptive \nlanguage was at age 3-4 level at age 9. After his left cortex was \nremoved at age 9, Alex suddenly began to learn language with gusto, \nand by age 15, his skills were those of an 8-10 year old.\n\n\nSecondly, most adults suffering infarcts in the left hemisphere \nlanguage areas do in fact recover at least some degree of language \ncompetence and many recover substantially normal competence, \nespecially with treatment (Holland et al. 1996). This is thought to \nbe due both to the regeneration of damaged speech areas and to \ncompensatory development in other areas, particularly in the right \nhemisphere (Karbe et al. 1998). Similar processes seem to be at work\nin young children with left hemisphere damage. Muller et al. 1999, \nfor instance, document significant relearning of language, together \nwith increased right-hemisphere involvement in language tasks, after \nleft-hemisphere lesions in both children (<10) years) and adults \n(>20 years).\n\n\nFinally, not even very young children are guaranteed to recover \nlanguage after serious insults, whether to the left or right \nhemisphere. As Bates and Roe (2001) argue in their survey of the \nchildhood aphasia literature, outcomes differ wildly from case to \ncase, and the reported studies exhibit numerous methodological \nconfounds (e.g., inability to localize the lesion or to know its \ncause, different measures of linguistic competence, different time \nframes for testing, statistical irregularities, and failure to \ncontrol for other factors known to affect language such as seizure \nhistory) that cast doubt on the degree of empirical support possessed\nby Lenneberg's claim in this instance.\n3.3.2 \u2018Wild children\u2019\n\n\nIt has long been recognized that interpretation of the \u2018wild\nchild\u2019 literature \u2014 helpfully surveyed in Skuse 1993\n\u2014 is confounded by the fortunate rarity of these \u2018natural\nexperiments,\u2019 the generally poor reporting of them, and the\nother environmental factors (abuse, malnutrition, neglect, etc.) that\noften go along with extreme linguistic deprivation.  However, in work\npioneered by Goldin Meadow and colleagues (e.g., Goldin Meadow and\nMylander 1983, 1990), a new population of individuals, who are\nlinguistically but not otherwise deprived, has begun to be\nstudied. Deaf but otherwise normal children of hearing parents who are\nneither educated in sign language nor sent to special schools for the\ndeaf do not acquire language, although they usually develop their own\nrudimentary signing systems, called \u2018homesign,\u2019 to use\nwith their families. Studies of what happens to such children after\nthey are exposed to natural languages (signed or verbal) at various\nages promise to offer new insights into the critical and sensitive\nperiod hypotheses.\n\n\nAt this time, however, there are still very few case reports in the \nliterature, and the data so far obtained in these studies are \nequivocal with respect to the sensitive and critical period \nhypotheses. Some adolescents do seem to be able to acquire language \ndespite early linguistic deprivation, and others do not. It is \nunclear what the explanation of these different outcomes is, but one \nimportant factor appears to be whether the new language is a signed \nlanguage (e.g., ASL) or a spoken language. Perhaps because their \nchildhood perceptual deficits prevented normal auditory and \narticulatory development, deaf children whose hearing is restored \nlater in life do not seem to be able to acquire much in the way of \nspoken language. (Grimshaw et al. 1998.)\n3.3.3 Second language acquisition in children and adults\n\n\nThe issue of second language acquisition (\u201cSLA\u201d) has been\nargued to bear on the innateness of language by supporting a critical\n(or sensitive) period hypothesis. For instance, Johnson and Newport \n(1989) found that among immigrants arriving in the U.S. before \npuberty, English performance as adults was better the earlier in life\nthey arrived, but that there were no effects of arrival age on \nlanguage performance for those arriving after puberty. The fact that \nthe amount of exposure to the second language mattered for speakers \nif it occurred before puberty but not after, was \ntaken to confirm the critical period hypothesis.\n\n\nHowever, these results have failed to be replicated (Birdsong and\nMolis 2001) and while it still has its supporters, the \u2018critical\nperiod\u2019 hypothesis regarding second language acquisition is\nincreasingly being criticized (Hakuta, Bialystok and Wiley 2003;\nNikolov and Djugunovich 2006). Newer studies have argued, for\ninstance, that the degree of proficiency in a second language\ncorrelates better with, such factors as the learner's level of\neducational attainment in that language, her length of residence in\nthe new country,) and the grammatical similarities between the first\nand second languages, and/or length of residence in the new\ncountry. (Flege, Yeni-Komshian and Liu 1999; Bialystok,\n1997)[22]\n\n\nThe fact that many adults and older children can learn both first and\nsecond languages to a high degree of proficiency makes clear that \nunlike the kitten visual system studied by Hubel and Wiesel, the \nlanguage acquisition system in humans is not subject to a critical \nperiod in the strict sense. This finding is consistent with the \nemerging view that the cortex remains highly plastic throughout life,\nand that contrary to received wisdom, even old dogs can be quite good\nat learning new tricks. (See Buonomano and Merzenich 1998; Cowen and\nGavazzi 1998; Quartz and Sejnowski 1997; and Stiles 2000.) It is \nalso consistent with the idea, which seems more plausible \nthan the critical period hypothesis, that there is a \nsensitive period for language acquisition \u2014 a time, \nfrom roughly birth age 1 to age 6 or 7, in which language is acquired\nmost easily and naturally, and when a native-like outcome is \nvirtually guaranteed. (Cf. Mayberry and Eichen 1991.) The \nimplications of this conclusion for linguistic nativism are examined \nin the next section.\n3.3.4 Sensitive periods and innateness: phonological learning\n\n\nWhat does the existence of a sensitive period for language mastery\ntell us about the innateness of language? In this section, we will\nlook at a case, namely phonological learning, in which the existence\nof a sensitive period has received much press, and in which the\ninference from sensitivity to the existence of language-specific\ninnate information has been made explicitly (see Eimas 1975). One can\nargue that even in this case, the inference to linguistic nativism is\nweak.\n\n\nMuch rarer than mastery of second language morphology and syntax is \nattainment of a native-like accent, something that first language \nlearners acquire automatically in \n childhood.[23]\n A child's ability to perceive language-specific sounds begins in \nutero, as demonstrated, for instance, by newborns' preference for the\nsounds of their mother's voice and their parents' language, and by \ntheir ability to discriminate prose passages that they have heard \nduring the final trimester from novel passages. In the first few \nmonths of life, babies reliably discriminate many different natural \nlanguage phonemes, whether or not they occur in what is soon to \nbecome their language. By ages 6 months to 1 year, however, this \nsensitivity to unheard phonemes largely disappears, and by age 1, \nchildren tend to make only the phonological distinctions made in the \nlanguage(s) they hear around them. For example, Japanese children \nlose the ability to discriminate English /r/ and /l/ (Kuhl et al., \n1997b). As adults, people continue to be unable to perceive some \nphonetic contrasts not marked by their language, and many fail to \nlearn how to produce even those second language sounds which they can\n\n distinguish.[24]\n For instance, many English speakers of French have great difficulty \nin producing the French /y/ (as in tu) and \nback-of-the-throat /r/.\n\n\nThus, in the case of phonological learning, there does seem to be an \ninborn predisposition to segment vocal sounds into language-relevant \nunits, or \n phonemes.[25]\n However, there is also evidence that learning plays a role in shaping\nphonological knowledge \u2014 and not just by \u2018pruning \naway\u2019 unwanted \u2018phonological representations,\u2019 as \nEimas (1975) hypothesized, but also by shaping the precise boundaries\nof adult phonemic categories. For example, caregivers reliably speak \na special \u2018language\u2019 (\u201cMotherese\u201d or \n\u201cParentese\u201d) to young babies, raising pitch, shortening \nsentences, emphasizing stressed morphemes and word boundaries and \n\u2014 most relevant here \u2014 exaggerating the acoustical \ndifferences between certain crucial vowels (in English, /i/, /a/ and \n/u/) . This \u2018stretching\u2019 of the distance between vowels \n(demonstrated in Finnish and Russian as well as English by Kuhl et \nal. 1997a) facilitates the infant's representation of clearly \ndistinguishable vowel prototypes. Kuhl 2000 argues that these \nprototypes subsequently function as \u2018magnets\u2019 around \nwhich subsequent linguistic experiences are organized, and form the \nset points of the language-specific phonological \u2018map\u2019 \nthat emerges by the end of the first year.\n\n\nIf this is indeed how phonological learning works, it is clear that \nwhile experience clearly plays a role, the inborn contribution to \nthat process is quite substantial. For discriminating phonemes \n\u2014 however those discriminations might be shaped by subsequent \nexperience \u2014 is no simple matter. It involves what is called \n\u2018categorical perception, that is, the segmenting of a signal \nthat varies continuously along a number of physical dimensions (e.g.,\nvoice onset time and formant frequency) into discrete categories, so \nthat signals within the category are counted as the same, even though\nacoustically, they may differ from one another more than do two \nsignals in different categories (see Fig. 5). (Harnad 1987 is a \nuseful collection of work on categorical perception to the \nmid-1980s.)\n\n\nBut is this inborn contribution to phonological learning language\nspecific, that is, does it support the conclusion that (this \naspect of) language is innate? And to this question, the answer \nappears to be \u2018No.\u2019 First, the \u2018chunking\u2019 of \ncontinuously varying stimuli into discrete categories is a feature \nnot just of speech perception, but of human perception generally. For\ninstance, it has been demonstrated in the perception of \nnon-linguistic sounds, like musical pitch, key and melody, and \nmeaningless chirps and bleats (Pastore and Layer 1990). It has also \nbeen demonstrated in the processing of visual stimuli like faces \n(Beale and Keil 1995), facial expressions (Etcoff and Magee 1992; \nKotsoni, de Haan and Johnson 2001); facial gender (Campanella, \nChrysochoos and Bruyer 2001); and familiar physical objects (Newell \nand Bulthoff 2002). Secondly, it is known that other animals too \nperceive categorically. For instance, crickets segment consepecific \nsongs in terms of frequency (Wyttenbach, May and Hoy 1996), swamp \nsparrows \u2018chunk\u2019 notes of differing durations (Nelson and\nMarler 1989), and rhesus monkeys can recognize melodies when \ntransposed by one or two octaves, but not by 1.5 or 2.5 octaves, \nindicating a grasp of musical key (Wright et al. 2000). Finally, \nother species respond categorically to human speech! Chinchillas \n(Kuhl and Miller 1975) and cotton-top tamarins (Ramus et al. 2000) \nmake similar phonological distinctions to those made by human \ninfants.\n\n\nTogether, as Kuhl 1994, 2000 argues, these findings cast doubt on \nthe language-specificity of the inborn perceptual and categorization \ncapacities that form the basis of human phonological learning. For \ngiven the fact that human (and animal) perception quite generally is \ncategorical, it is arguable that languages have evolved so as to \nexploit the perceptual distinctions that humans are able to make, \nrather than humans' having evolved the abilities to make just the \ndistinctions that are made in human languages, as a view like Eimas' \nwould suggest. \n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Note that the pair of sounds circled in blue differ in F2 \nstarting frequency less than those circled in red, yet the former are\nboth reliably counted as instances of the sounds /b/ whereas the \nlatter are reliably classified as different sounds, /d/ and /g/. This\npattern, together with the abrupt switch from one classification to \nanother (e.g. /b/ to /g/), is characteristic of categorical \nperception.\n\n\n\nThe same may be true in non-phonological domains too. The notion that\nat least some of the capacities responsible for syntactic learning \nare non-language specific is suggested by analogous results about the\nnon-species specificity of recursive rule learning and generalization\n\u2014 an ability that Chomsky has recently suggested forms the core\nof the human language faculty. (Hauser, Chomsky and Fitch 2002; see \nbelow, 3.4 for further discussion.) Other species, notably cotton top\ntamarins, seem capable of learning simple recursive rules (Hauser, \nWeiss, and Marcus 2002). In addition, Hauser and McDermott 2003 \nargue that musical and syntactic processing involve similar \ncompetences, which are again seen in other species. Together, these \nfindings suggest that there are aspects of the human \u2018language \nfaculty\u2019 that are neither task-specific nor species-specific. \nInstead, language learning and linguistic processing make use of \nabilities that predate language phylogenetically, and that are used \nin humans and in animals for other sorts of tasks. (See e.g., Hauser,\nWeiss, and Marcus 2002 for an account of recent work on rule \nlearning by cotton top tamarins; see Hauser and McDermott 2003 for \nthe suggestion that aspects of musical and syntactic processing \ninvolve similar competences, which are again seen in other species.) \nRather than viewing the human mind as being innately specialized for \nlanguage language learning, it seems at least as reasonable to think \nof languages as being specialized so as to be learnable and usable by\nthe human mind; of this, more in \u00a73.4 below.\n3.4 Language Evolution\n\n\nThis brings us to the question of language evolution: if knowledge of\nlanguage (say, of the principles of UG) really is inborn in the human\nlanguage faculty, how did such inborn knowledge evolve? For many \nyears, Chomsky himself refused to speculate about this matter, \nstating that \u201c[e]volutionary theory\u2026has little to say, \nas of now, about questions of this nature\u201d (1988:167). Other \ntheorists have not been so reticent, and a large literature has grown\nup in which the selective advantages of having a language are \nadumbrated. It's good for communicating with, for instance, when \ntrying to figure out what conspecifics are up to (Pinker and Bloom, \n1990; Dunbar 1996). It's a mechanism of group cohesion, analogous to\nprimate grooming (Dunbar 1996). It's a non-genetic mechanism of \nphenotypical plasticity, allowing organisms to adapt to their \nenvironment in non-evolutionary time (Brandon and Hornstein 1986; \nSterelny 2003). It's a mechanism by which we can bend others to our \nwill (Dawkins and Krebs 1979; Catania 1990), or make social \ncontracts (Skyrms 1996). Language makes us smarter, perhaps by being\ninternalized and functioning as a \u2018language of thought\u2019 \n(Bickerton 1995, 2000). And so on.\n\n\nThe ability to speak and understand a language no doubt provided and \ncontinues to provide us with many of these benefits. Consequently \n(and assuming that the costs were not too great \u2014 as patently \nthey weren't), one can be sure that whatever it is about human beings\nthat enables them to learn and use language would have been subjected\nto strong positive selection pressure once it began to emerge in our \nspecies.\n\n\nBut none of this speaks directly to the issue of linguistic nativism.\nThe fact that Mother Nature would have favored individuals or groups \npossessing linguistic abilities tells us nothing about the \nmeans she chose to get the linguistic phenotype built. That \nis, it tells us nothing about the sorts of psychological mechanisms \nthat were recruited to enable human beings to learn, and subsequently\nuse, a natural language.\n\n\nNativism is, of course, one possibility. Natural selection might have\nbuilt a specialized language faculty, containing inborn knowledge \nabout language (e.g., knowledge of UG), which subsequently was \nselected for because it helped human children to acquire linguistic \ncompetence, and having linguistic competence enhanced our ancestors' \nfitness. A problem with this hypothesis, however, is that it is \nunclear how a language faculty containing innate representations of \nUG might have arisen in the human mind. One view is that the language\nfaculty was built up piecemeal by natural selection. This approach \nunderlies Pinker and Bloom's (1990) and Jackendoff's (1999) proposals\nas to the adaptive functions of various grammatical features and \ndevices. Other nativists, however, reject the adaptationist \nframework. For instance, Berwick 1998, has argued that efforts to \nexplain the piecemeal development of knowledge of linguistic \nuniversals in our species may be unnecessary in light of the new, \nMinimalist conception of syntax (see Chomsky 1995). On this view, \nall parametric constraints and rules of syntax are consequences of a \nfundamental syntactic process called Merge: once Merge was in place, \nBerwick argues, the rest of UG automatically followed. Chomsky, \ntaking another tack, has suggested that language is a \n\u2018spandrel,\u2019 a byproduct of other non-linguistically \ndirected selective processes, such as \u201cthe increase in brain \nsize and complexity\u201d (1982:23). And finally Bickerton 1998, on \nyet another tack, posits a massive saltative episode in which large \nchunks of syntax emerged all at once, although this posit is \nimplicitly withdrawn in Calvin and Bickerton 2000.\n\n\nThe literature on language evolution is too large to survey in this \narticle (but see Botha 2003 for an excellent overview and critique).\nSuffice it to note that as yet, no consensus has emerged as to how\n innate knowledge of UG might have evolved from \nwhatever preadaptations existed in our ancestors. Of course, this is \nnot in itself a problem for linguistic nativists: formulating and \ntesting hypotheses about human cognitive evolution is a massively \ndifficult enterprise, due largely to the difficulty of finding \nevidence bearing on one's hypothesis. (See Lewontin 1998 and Sterelny\n2003:95-116.)\n\n\nIt's worth noting, however, that linguistic nativism is just one \npossibility for how Nature got language up and running. Just as it \nmay be that a language faculty embodying knowledge of UG was somehow \nencoded in the human genome, it's also possible that that our ability\nto learn a language is based on a congeries of pre-existing \ncompetences, none of which is (or was initially \u2014 see below) \nspecialized for language learning. Tomasello's theory of language \nacquisition, discussed above (\u00a72.2.1.b), invites this \nalternative evolutionary perspective. On his view, the fundamental \nskills with which linguistic competence is acquired are skills that \noriginally served, and still continue to serve, quite different, \nnon-linguistic functions. For example, he argues that children's \nearly word and phrase learning rest in part on their ability to share\nattention with others, to discern others' communicative intentions, \nand to imitate aspects of their behavior. There is reason to think \nthat these abilities evolved independently of language, at least \ninitially: imitation learning enabled the fast and high-fidelity \ntransfer of learned skills between generations (see Tomasello 1999, \n2000) and the ability to form beliefs about the mental states of \nothers (\u2018mind-reading\u2019 or \u2018theory of mind\u2019) \nenabled highly intelligent animals, such as our hominid ancestors, to\nnegotiate a complex social environment made up of similarly \nintelligent conspecifics. (See, e.g., Sterelny 2003.) On this sort \nof view, the ability to learn language piggy-backed on other \ncapacities, which originally evolved for other reasons and which \ncontinue to serve other functions in addition to their linguistic \nones.\n\n\nYou might wonder, however, whether this latter kind of account really\ndiffers substantively from that of a nativist. Assuming that she does\nnot reject adaptationism altogether, the nativist will presumably be \ncommitted to the idea that the innate language organ, or faculty \nembodying knowledge of UG, was derived from pre-existing structures \nthat were either functionless or had non-linguistic functions. These \nstructures subsequently acquired linguistic functions through being \nselected for that reason: they became adaptations for language. But \nso too would the various capacities postulated by Tomasello. As soon \nas they started being used for language learning, that's to say, they\nwould have been selected for that function (in addition to any other \nfunctions they might serve, and always assuming that linguistic \nabilities were on balance beneficial). Hence they too will over time \nbecome adaptations for language. On both Tomasello's and the \nnativist's view, in other words, the inborn structures responsible \nfor language acquisition will have acquired the biological function \nof enabling language acquisition: they will be specialized for that \npurpose. Is Tomasello, then, a nativist?\n\n\nNo. First, even though the psychological abilities and mechanisms \nthat Tomasello posits have been selected for linguistic functions, \nthese abilities and mechanisms have continued to be used (and, \nplausibly, selected) for non-linguistic purposes, such as face \nrecognition, theory of mind, non-linguistic perception, etc. So, \nwhereas a central tenet of linguistic nativism is its insistence that\nthe structures responsible for language learning are \ntask-specific, Tomasello sees those structures as being much\nmore general-purpose. In addition, and this is a second reason not to\ncount Tomasello as a nativist, the inborn structures he posits are \nnot plausibly interpreted as containing any kind of language specific\ninformation or representations. Yet a commitment to the role of \ninborn, language-specific information (such as knowledge of UG) is \nanother hallmark of linguistic nativism.\n\n\nSeveral theorists (e.g., Clark 1996, Tomasello 1999, and Sterelny, \n2003) have stressed that in addition to working on human linguistic \nabilities directly, via changes to the parts of the genome coding for\nthose abilities, natural selection can also bring about such changes \nindirectly, by making sure that our minds are embedded in certain \nkinds of environments. All sorts of animals create environments for \nthemselves: this is called \u2018niche construction.\u2019 (The \nterm is due to Odling-Smee, Laland and Feldman 1996.) Many animals \nalso (or thereby) create environments for their offspring as well. \nAnd as Odling-Smee et al. 1996, Avital and Jablonka 2000, and \nSterelny 2003 stress, animals' dispositions to modify the \nenvironments of both themselves and their offspring in certain ways \nare just as much potential objects of selection as are other of their\ntraits.\n\n\nTo see this, suppose that an organism O has a genetically encoded \ndisposition N to build a special kind of nest; suppose further that \nbeing raised in this kind of nest causes O-type offspring to have \ncharacteristic C; and suppose finally, that Os with C enjoy greater \nreproductive success than those without. Then, assuming that there is\nvariation in N in the population, natural selection can operate so as\nto increase the proportion of Os with N \u2014 and hence also those \nwith characteristic C \u2014 in the population. Down the track, Os \nwill have C not by virtue of acquiring a special, genetically-encoded\ndisposition-for-C. Rather, they will have C because their parents \nhave the genetically-encoded disposition N, and Os whose parents have\nN \u2018automatically\u2019 develop C.\n\n\nThis toy example illustrates a further route by which language might \nhave evolved in human beings. In addition to creating inborn \nlanguage-learning mechanisms in individuals, natural selection may \nalso have created dispositions to construct particular kinds of \nlinguistic learning environments in their parents. \nFor example, as Clark (1996) and Sterelny (2003) both speculate, \nMother Nature might have worked on our dispositions to use \n\u2018Motherese\u2019 to our children, and/or on our tendency to \ntalk about things that are current objects of the child's perceptual \nattention, in order to create learning environments conducive to the \nacquisition of language.\n\n\nIn principle, the existence of this sort of \u2018niche\nconstruction\u2019 can be accepted by all parties to the nativism\ncontroversy. That is, both Tomasello and Chomsky could agree that\ndispositions to construct \u2018linguistic niches\u2019 \u2014\nenvironments in which languages are easy for human offspring to learn\n\u2014 may have been selected for in our species. Nevertheless, the\nnotion of niche construction militates against the nativist,\nparticularly when one takes into account the related notion of\n\u2018cumulative downstream niche construction.\u2019\n\n\nCases of what Sterelny (2003: 149ff) calls \u2018cumulative \ndownstream niche construction\u2019 occur when a generation of \nanimals modifies an environment that has already been modified by \nearlier generations. A mountain thornbill's nest is an instance of \ndownstream niche construction (since its offspring are affected by \nthe thornbill's efforts). However, the construction is not \ncumulative, since the nest is built anew each year. By contrast, a \nrabbit warren extended and elaborated over several generations is an \ninstance of cumulative construction: successive generations of \noffspring inherit an ever-more-complex niche and their other \nbehaviors are tuned accordingly in ever-more-complex ways. Tomasello,\n1999 and Sterelny 2003 stress that niche construction, including \ndownstream niche construction, is not limited to the physical world: \nanimals make changes to their social and epistemic worlds as well. \nFor instance, chimpanzees live in groups (= construction of a social \nniche) and dogs mark their territory (= a change in their epistemic \nniche, relieving them of the necessity of remembering where the \nboundaries of their territory are). Humans, says Sterelny, echoing a \ntheme of Tomasello 1999, are niche constructors \u201cwith a \nvengeance\u201d (2003:149) and many of the changes they make to \ntheir physical, social and epistemic environments accumulate over \nmany generations (think of a city, a democracy, modern science, a \nnatural language). Such cumulative modifications allow for what \nTomasello calls a \u201cratchet effect\u201d: a \u201ccycle in \nwhich an improvement is made, becomes standard for the group, and \nthen becomes a basis for further innovation.\u201d (Sterelny 2003: \n150-1)\n\n\nThe idea of cumulative niche construction has obvious application to \nthe case of language. If parents shape the linguistic environment of \ntheir offspring, and if we all shape the linguistic environments of \nour conspecifics (merely by talking to them!) then the possibility of\na \u2018linguistic ratchet effect\u2019 is clearly open. Small \nchanges made to the language of the group by one generation \u2014 \nchanges which perhaps make it easier to learn, or easier to \nunderstand or produce \u2014 will be transmitted to later \ngenerations, who may in turn make further changes geared to \nincreasing language learnability and ease of use. This scenario \nraises the possibility, already mentioned at the end of the last \nsection, that language may have evolved so as to be learnable and \nusable by us, in addition to the converse scenario (stressed in much \nwork on the evolution of language) that we had to change in \nmany and complex ways in order to learn and use a language. Thus, we \nmight speculate, languages' phonetic systems evolved so as to be \ncongenial to our animal ears; their expressive resources (in \nparticular, their vocabularies) evolved so as to fit our \ncommunicative needs; and perhaps, as Clark 1997 has suggested and as \nTomasello 2003 implicitly takes for granted, natural language syntax\nevolved so as to suit our pre-existing cognitive and processing \ncapacities. To be sure, the languages we have coded in our heads look\ncomplex and weird to linguists and psychologists and philosophers who\nare trying to put together theories about them. But, if languages and\nhuman minds have evolved in tandem, as surely they have, then \nlanguages may not look weird at all from the point of view of the \nbrains that implement and use them.\n\n\nAll of these processes have likely played a role in the evolution of\nour capacities to learn and use a natural language.  Pre-existing\npsychological, perceptual and motor capacities would have been\nrecruited for the task of language learning and use. These capacities\nwould have been honed and specialized further by natural selection for\nthe performance of linguistic tasks. The functions of some of them,\nperhaps, would have become so specialized for language-related tasks\nthat they cease to perform any non-linguistic functions at all \u2014\nand to this extent, perhaps, linguistic nativism would be\nvindicated. At the same time, however, language itself would have been\nevolving so as the better to suit our cognitive and perceptual\ncapacities, and our communicative needs.  Given the fact that many\ndifferent perceptual, motor and cognitive systems are implicated in\nlanguage use and learning, and given the co-evolution of our minds and\nour languages, the truth about language evolution, when it emerges, is\nunlikely to be a simple. For this reason, it is unlikely to\nvindicate the nativist's notion that a specialized and monolithic\n\u2018language organ\u2019 or \u2018faculty\u2019 is at the root\nof our linguistic capacities.\n\n\nBefore leaving the question of language evolution, it is necessary to\nmention a recent paper by Hauser, Chomsky and Fitch 2002 on this \ntopic. First, they distinguish (2002:1571) what they call the \n\u2018faculty of language in the narrow sense,\u2019 or \n\u2018FLN,\u2019 from the \u2018faculty of language in the broad \nsense,\u2019 or \u2018FLB.\u2019 The FLN is the \u201cabstract \nlinguistic computational system alone\u2026which generates internal\nrepresentations and maps them into the sensory-motor interface by the\nphonological system, and into the conceptual-intentional interface by\nthe (formal) semantic system.\u201d (Ibid.) The FLB \nincludes the FLN plus all the other systems (motor systems, \nconceptual systems, perceptual systems, and learning skills) which \ncontribute to language acquisition and use.\n\n\nNext, Hauser et al. speculate that the only thing that's really \nspecial about the human FLB is the FLN. That is, with the exception \nonly of the FLN, FLB comprises systems that are shared with (or only \nslight modifications of) systems in other animals. Consequently, \nthere is no mystery (or no more mystery than usual) about how these \nlanguage-related abilities evolved. FLN, on the other hand, is \ndistinctive to humans and what is special about it is its power of \nrecursion, that is, its ability to categorize linguistic \nobjects into hierarchically organized classes, and (on the behavioral\nside) for the generation of infinitely many sentences out of finitely\nmany words. According to Hauser et al., the only real evolutionary \nmystery about language is how this capacity for recursion evolved \n\u2014 and this question, argue Hauser et al, is eminently \naddressable by normal biological methods (e.g., comparative studies \nto determine possible precursor mechanisms, etc.).\n\n\nHowever, there are two difficulties with this scenario. First, there \nis evidence that the power of recursion posited by Hauser et al. as \nbeing distinctive of the human FLN is in fact not distinctive to \nhumans, because it is not species specific. (See Esser, et al. 1997\nand McGonigle, Chalmers and Dickinson, 2003.) Second, \nrecursiveness is not language specific either, but is a feature of \nother domains of human cognition and endeavor as well. Our conceptual\nspace, for instance, appears to be hierarchically ordered (poodles \nare a kind of dog, which are a kind of quadruped, which are a kind of\nanimal, etc.). Similarly, the planning and execution of \nnon-linguistic actions seems often to involve the sequencing and \ncombining of smaller behavioral units into larger wholes. Recursion \nmight well be an important part of the human language faculty, but \nit's apparently not specific either to us or to that faculty. Or, to \nput the point more bluntly: if it's Chomsky's view that recursiveness\nis the pivotal feature of the language faculty, and if recursiveness \nis a feature of human cognition and action more generally, then it's \nnot clear that Chomsky remains a linguistic \n nativist.[26]\n\n3.5 Pidgins and Creoles\n\n\nIt has been argued (by, e.g., Bickerton  1981, and Pinker, \n1994:32-9) that the process by which a pidgin turns into a creole \nprovides direct evidence of the operation of an innate language \nfaculty. Pidgins are rudimentary communication systems that are \ndeveloped when people speaking different languages come together \n(often in a commercial setting or when one people has conquered and \nis exploiting another) and need to communicate about practical \nmatters. Creoles arise when pidgins are elaborated both syntactically\nand semantically, and take on the characteristics of bona \nfide natural languages.\n\n\nBickerton and, following him, Pinker, argue that creolization occurs \nwhen children take a pidgin as the input to their first language \nlearning, and urge that the added complexity of the creole reflects \nthe operation of the child's inborn language faculty. Moreover, they \nargue, since creole languages all tend to be elaborated in the same \nways, and since they all respect the constraints of UG, the \nphenomenon of creolization also supports the idea that the inborn \ncontribution to language acquisition is not just some general drive \nfor an effective system of communication, but rather knowledge of \nlinguistic universals.\n\n\nThere are two problems with this \u2018language bioprogram \nhypothesis,\u2019 as it is known in the creolization literature. The\nfirst concerns the claim (e.g., Bickerton 1981:43-70) that even \ncreoles that developed in quite different areas of the world, and in \ncomplete isolation from one another, bear \u201cuncanny \nresemblances\u201d (Pinker 1994:25) to each other, not just in \nrespecting the constraints of UG, but \u2014 even more surprisingly \n\u2014 in using fundamentally the same means to elaborate their root\npidgins (e.g., in using the same syntactic devices to mark tense, \naspect and modality). The stronger claim made by Bickerton \u2014 \nthat Creoles use the same devices for the same grammatical purposes \n\u2014 is simply not true. For example, as Myhill (1991) argues, \nJamaican Creole, Louisiana Creole, Mauritian Creole and Guyanese \nCreole mark tense, aspect and modality in ways that are quite \ndifferent from those that Bickerton (1981) proposed as universal. \n(See, however, Mufwene 1999 for a case that confirms Bickerton's \npredictions.) The weaker claim \u2014 that creoles respect the \nconstraints imposed by UG \u2014 has not, so far as I know, been \ncontested. So we will assume, in what follows, that creoles, like \nother NLs, respect UG. The important question for our purposes is: \nhow does this come about?\n\n\nThe bioprogram hypothesis claims that creolization occurs as a result\nof the action of the language faculty: children who learn language \nfrom degraded (e.g., pidgin) inputs are compelled by their innate \nknowledge of grammar to produce a fully-fledged natural language (the\ncreole) as output. As an example of how children add UG-constrained \nstructure to languages learned from degraded inputs, Pinker cites the\ncase of Simon, a deaf child studied by Newport and her colleagues, \nwho learned American Sign Language (ASL) from parents who themselves \nwere not exposed to ASL until their late teens. Although they used \nASL as their primary language, Simon's parents were \u201cin many \nways\u2026like pidgin speakers,\u201d says Pinker (1994:38). For \ninstance, they used inflectional markers in an inconsistent way and \noften failed to respect the structure-dependence of the rules \ngoverning topicalization in that \n language.[27]\n But \u201castoundingly,\u201d says Pinker, \u201cthough Simon saw \nno ASL but his parents' defective version, his own signing was far \nbetter ASL then theirs\u2026Simon must somehow have shut out his \nparents' ungrammatical \u2018noise.\u2019 He must have latched on \nto the inflections that his parents used inconsistently, and \ninterpreted them as mandatory.\u201d (1994:39) Pinker views this as \na case of \u201ccreolization by a single living child\u201d \n(ibid.) and explains Simon's conformity to ASL grammar in \nterms of the operation of his innate language faculty during the \nacquisition period.\n\n\nIn a recent overview of the Simon data from the last 10 or so years, \nhowever, Newport 2001, stresses a number of facts that Pinker's \npresentation obscures or downplays. First, Simon's performance was \nnot that of a native signer, although he did develop \u201chis own \nversion of ASL whose structure was more like that of other natural \nlanguages [than that of his parents' ASL]\u201d (Newport 2001:168).\nFor instance, Simon's morphology stabilized at a level that was \n\u201cnot as complex as native ASL\u201d and he didn't acquire \nstandard classifier morphemes if they were not used by his parents \n(ibid.). Secondly, Simon's success in learning a given rule \nseemed to vary with how well or badly his parents signed. For \ninstance, Simon's parents used the correct inflectional morphology \n60-75% of the time for a large class of verbs of motion, and in this \ncase, Simon's own use of such morphology was 90% correct. However, \nsome members of the class of classifier morphemes were correctly used\nby the parents only 40% of the time, and in this case, although \nSimon's performance was better than his parents', it was not at \nnative signer level.\n\n\nNewport argues that Simon appears to be \u2018cleaning up\u2019 his\nparents' language, that is, \u201cbas[ing] his learning heavily on \nhis input, but reorganiz[ing] this input to form a cleaner, more \nrule-governed system than the one to which he was exposed.\u201d \n(2001:168) She agrees that this result could be due to constraints \nimposed by an innate language faculty, but argues that it is also \nconsistent with the existence of some more generalized propensity in \nchildren to generate systematic rules from noisy inputs, rightly \npointing out that the latter hypothesis cannot be ruled out in \nadvance of empirical test. (In this context, she notes (p.170) some \npreliminary studies suggesting that inferring systematic rules from \nmessy data may indeed be a more general feature of learning in young \nchildren (though, interestingly, not in adults), for they can be seen\nto exhibit this tendency in non-linguistic pattern-learning contexts \ntoo.) Newport concludes that \u201cthe contrasts between Simon and \nhis parents are in certain ways less extreme, and more \nreorganizational, than might be suggested by the Language Bioprogram \nHypothesis\u2026[H]e does not appear to be creating an entirely new\nlanguage from his own innate specifications; rather, he appears to be\nfollowing the predominant tendencies of his input, but he sharpens \nthem, extends them, and forces them to be internally \nconsistent.\u201d (2001:173).\n\n\nIf Newport et al. are right, the case of Simon does not seem to give \nmuch support to the nativist hypothesis. Moreover, the argument from \ncreolization suffers a number of additional flaws. First, the \nBickerton-Pinker view, which assigns a dominant role to child \nlanguage learners in the creation of creoles, is but one of three \ncompeting hypotheses currently being explored in the creolization \nliterature. According to the \u2018superstratist\u2019 hypothesis, \ncreolization occurs not when children acquire language from pidgins, \nbut when successive waves of adult speakers try to learn the language\nof the dominant culture as a second language. (Chaudenson 1992, for \ninstance, defends this view about the origins of French creoles.) On \nthis view, the additional devices seen in creoles are corruptions of \ndevices seen in the dominant language. According to the \n\u2018substratist\u2019 hypothesis, creoles are again created by \nsecond language learners, rather than children, only the source of \nadded structure is the first language of the learner. (Lumsden 1999 \nargues that numerous traces of a variety of African languages in \nHaitian creole support this hypothesis.) One need not take a stand on\nwhich of these views is correct in order to see that these competing \nexplanations of creolization undermine Bickerton and Pinker's \n\u2018bioprogram\u2019 hypothesis. If creoles arise out of the \nattempts of adult learners to learn (and subsequently pass on to \ntheir children) another, non-native language, then what one might \ncall \u2018contamination of the stimulus,\u2019 rather than the \ninfluence of an inborn UG in the learner, is what accounts for the \nUG-respecting ways in which creoles are elaborated.\n\n\nHowever, there is a case of creolization in which these other \nhypotheses apparently fail to gain purchase, as Pinker (1994:37ff.) \nemphasizes. This is the case of the development of Idioma de Signos \nNicarag\u00fcense (ISN, Nicaraguan Sign Language), a brand-new \nnatural sign language which first emerged around 30 years ago in \nschools for the deaf in and around Managua. These schools were first \nset up in the 1970s, and ISN evolved from the hodge-podge of homesign\nsystems used by students who entered the schools at that time. ISN is\nan interesting test case of the bioprogram hypothesis for two \nreasons. First, homesign systems are idiosyncratic and possess little\nsyntactic structure: the natural-languagelike syntax of ISN could \ntherefore not derive from substrate influence. And Spanish, the only \npotential candidate for superstrate influence was allegedly \ninaccessible to signers because of its auditory modality. Pinker \nclaims that ISN provides another example of creolization and the \nworkings of the innate language faculty: it is \n\u201ccreated\u2026in one leap when the younger children were \nexposed to the pidgin singing of the older children.\u201d \n(1994:36-7)\n\n\nIn their discussion of the development of ISN, however, Kegl, Senghas\nand Coppola (1999) show that things are not quite this \nstraightforward. ISN did not develop \u2018in one leap,\u2019 from \nthe very rudimentary homesigns or \u2018Mimicas\u2019 spoken by \nindividual deaf students. Instead, its evolution was more gradual and\nwas preceded by the creation of what Kegl et al. call \u201cLenguage\nde Signos Nicarag\u00fcense\u201d (LSN), a kind of \u201cpidgin or \njargon\u201d (181) that \u201cdeveloped from the point when these \nhomesigners came together in the schools and began to share their \nhomesigns with each other, quickly leading to more and more shared \nsigns and grammatical devices\u201d (180). In addition, the signers \nhad access to Spanish language dictionaries, and their language was \nalso influenced by the signing of Spanish-speaking, non-deaf teachers\nat the schools \u2014 signing which likely incorporated such \ngrammatical devices of the teachers' language as were transferable to\na non-vocal medium. (K. Stromswold, private communication.)\n\n\nWhile Kegl et al. endorse the language bioprogram hypothesis that ISN\nemerged \u2018in one leap,\u2019 in the minds of children exposed \nto degraded Mimica or LSN inputs, their data are equally consistent \nwith the idea that ISN developed more gradually by means of \nsuccessive elaborations and innovations among a community of \nhighly-motivated (because language-starved) young users. Indeed, as \nKegl et al. themselves describe the history (p.187), this is \nprecisely what happened. First, a group of signers, each with his or \nher own idiosyncratic form of Mimicas, entered the schools. Members \nof this group gained in expressive power as their individual Mimicas \nwere enriched by borrowings from others' homesign systems. Then, a \nnew cohort of Mimicas signers entered the schools. Their sign systems\nbenefitted both from exposure to the Mimicas of their peers and from \nexposure to the richer system developed by the earlier group. Through\na process of successive elaborations in this manner, LSN developed \nand then, by a similar series of steps, ISN developed. At present, \nall three sign systems are still being used in Nicaragua, presumably \nreflecting the different ages at which people are exposed to language\nand the kinds of inputs (ISN or LSN vs. signed and written Spanish or\nlipreading in regular schools) they receive. In addition, ISN and to \na lesser extent LSN are still constantly changing \u2014 as one \nwould expect if ISN were a community-wide work in progress, not the \nfinished product of an individual child's mind,\n3.6 Developmental Language Disorders and the Search for \u2018Language Genes\u2019\n\n\nDissociations of language disorders acquired in adulthood (e.g., \nBroca's and Wernicke's aphasia) may tell us something about how \nlanguage is organized in the mature brain, but cannot tell us much \nabout how language is acquired or the role of innate knowledge in \nthat process \u2014 a fact that nativists about language generally \nacknowledge. By contrast, language dissociations arising during \nchildhood are sometimes held to bear strongly on the question of \nwhether language is innate. Pinker (1994:297-314) articulates this \nlatter line of thought, arguing that there is a double dissociation \nbetween \u2018general intelligence\u2019 and language in two \ndevelopmental disorders called Williams Syndrome (WS) and Specific \nLanguage Impairment (SLI). People with WS have IQs well below the \nnormal range (50-60), yet are able to speak fluently and engagingly \nabout many topics. Those with SLI, by contrast, have normal \n(\u224890) non-verbal intelligence but speak effortfully and slowly,\nfrequently making errors in their production and comprehension of \nsentences and words. Pinker argues that there is a double \ndissociation here, and that it supports the view that there is a \nspecial \u2018language acquisition device\u2019 that is separable \nfrom any general learning abilities children might possess. In \naddition, following Gopnik 1990a,b, and Gopnik and Crago 1991, he \nurges that the fact that the dissociation appears to concern aspects \nof syntax in particular indicates that the language faculty in \nquestion is the grammar faculty. Finally, and again following Gopnik,\nhe argues that since SLI appears to run in families and, in at least \none case, displays a Mendelian inheritance pattern, what we have here\nis evidence not just of a \u2018grammar faculty,\u2019 but of a \n\u2018grammar gene.\u2019\n3.6.1 Williams Syndrome\n\n\nWS is a rare genetic disorder with a complex phenotype. Physically, \nWS individuals display dismorphic facial features, abnormal growth \npatterns, gastrointestinal problems, early puberty, neurological \nabnormalities (including hypotonia, hyperreflexia, hyperacuisis and \ncerebellar dysfunction), defective vision and eye development, bad \nteeth, connective tissue abnormalities, and heart problems. \nPsychologically, in addition to their low non-verbal IQ and \ncomparatively spared language abilities, they display relatively good\naudiovisual memory but very impaired visual-spatial abilities, \nleading to difficulties in daily life (e.g., getting dressed). They \nhave outgoing personalities and are highly sociable to the point of \noverfriendliness, but also display numerous behavioral and emotional \nproblems (especially hyperactivity and difficulty concentrating in \nchildhood, and anxiety in later life). (Morris and Mervis 2000; \nMervis et al. 2000.)\n\n\nAs to their language, there is currently a debate in the literature\nwith regard to its normalcy. According to one point of view, the\nlinguistic competence of WS individuals is remarkably normal,\nespecially in comparison with that of similarly retarded individuals,\nsuch as those with Downs syndrome (Pinker 1994, 1997; Clahsen and\nAlmazan 1998; Bello et al. 2004; Bellugi et\nal. 1998). While rather unusual in their choice of words (e.g.,\nproducing chihuahua, ibis and condor in addition to\nmore usual animal words in a word fluency test) and despite\nan excessive use of clich\u00e9s and social stock-phrases, their\nability to use language, especially in conversational contexts, is\nmore or less intact. For example, they may appear relatively normal in\nsocial interactions, and their processing of conditional questions and\nability to repeat sentences with complex syntax is closer to that of\nnormal controls than to matched Downs syndrome controls\n(Bellugi et al. 2000: 13, 15).\n\n\nAccording to another school of thought, however, the language \nabilities of WS subjects might be more normal than those of Downs \nsyndrome individuals, and might look remarkable in contrast to their \nown marked disabilities in other areas, but nonetheless display a \nnumber of abnormal characteristics across a variety of measures when \ninvestigated further. WS language shows \u201cmassively \ndelayed\u201d early acquisition, especially of vocabulary (Bellugi \net al. 2000:11) and grammatical morphemes (Caprirci et\nal. 1996); overregularization of regular plural and past tense\nendings as well defective competence with regard to irregular nouns\nand verbs (Clahsen and Almazan 2001); \u201cinordinate difficulty\nwith morphosyntax\u201d (Morris and Mervis 2000: 467; see also\nVolterra et al. 1996; Karmiloff-Smith et al. 1997;\nLevy and Hermon 2003); and impaired mastery of relative clause\nconstructions (Grant et al., 2002), embedded sentences, and\n(in French) grammatical gender assignment (Karmiloff-Smith et\nal. 1997). Indeed, Bellugi et al., 2000, found that WS\nchildren's performance on a sentence-repetition task was\nindistinguishable from that of matched controls diagnosed with\nSpecific Language Impariment, or SLI (see below, \u00a73.6.2).\nFindings such as these lead experts such as Annette Karmilloff-Smith\nto urge \u201cdethroning the myth\u201d of WS' \u201cintact\u201d\nsyntactic abilities (Karmiloff-Smith et al. 2003) and move\nUrsula Bellugi \u2014 formerly a proponent of the \u2018spared\nlanguage\u2019 viewpoint \u2014 to caution that \u201cbecause their\nlanguage abilities are often at a level that is higher than their\noverall cognitive abilities, individuals with WMS might be perceived\nto be more capable than they really are.\u201d (Bellugi et\nal. 1999.)\n\n\nIn contrast to its cognitive profile, which is, as we have seen, a \nsubject of debate, the genetic basis of WS is known. It results from \na \u22481.5 Mb deletion encompassing the elastin gene ELN at \nchromosome 7q11.23; most cases appear to be due to new mutations. ELN\nis crucial in synthesizing elastin, a protein which holds cells \ntogether in the elastic fibers found in connective tissues throughout\nthe body and in especially high concentrations in cartilege, \nligaments and arterial walls. Failure to synthesize this protein \ndisrupts development in numerous ways, from the first trimester \nonwards, and gives rise through processes that are not well \nunderstood to the raft of symptoms associated with the syndrome. \n(Morris and Mervis 2000; Mervis et al. 2000.)\n3.6.2 Specific Language Impairment\n\n\nIn contrast with Williams syndrome, in which one sees comparatively \nspared language in the face of mild to moderate mental retardation \nand numerous physical defects, specific language impairment \n(\u2018SLI\u2019) is diagnosed when (i) non-verbal intelligence as \nmeasured by standard IQ tests is normal; (ii) verbal IQ is well below\nnormal; and (iii) obvious causes of language impairment (e.g., \ndeafness, frank neurological damage) can be ruled out. As one might \nexpect given these diagnostic criteria, a diagnosis of SLI embraces a\nhighly heterogeneous collection of language-related deficits, not all\nof which co-occur in every case of language impairment. (Bishop, \n1994; Bishop et al,. 2000.) These include:\n\nproductive and receptive phonological deficits (e.g., difficulty\nproducing clusters of consonants, as in spectacle, and\nfailure to show categorical perception of phonemes differentiated by\nplace of articulation (/ba/ vs. /ga/) and voicing (/ba/ vs. /pa/);\nmorphological deficits (e.g., generation of past tenses or plurals\nby using affixes);\n productive and receptive syntactic deficits (e.g., analyzing\n\u2018reversible\u2019 passives (Katie kissed Jacob\nvs. Jacob was kissed by Katie), complex dative constructions\n(e.g., Katie gave Jacob the book) and anaphora (e.g.,\nKatie said that Sarah scratched her vs.  Katie said that\nSarah scratched herself).\n\n\n\nAs a consequence of this heterogeneity, SLI, researchers have \nintroduced a number of subtypes of the disorder, including such \nthings as \u2018Verbal auditory agnosia,\u2019 \n\u2018Lexical-syntactic deficit syndrome\u2019 and \n\u2018Phonological programming syndrome\u2019 (Bishop 1994). Also \nas a consequence, and in part because studies do not always \ndistinguish between different subtypes, the etiology of SLI in \ngeneral is not well understood (O'Brien et al. 2003), although \nrecent research suggests at least two distinct genetic loci are \ninvolved in at least some subtypes of the disorder (Bishop 2006). \nSome posit an underlying defect in the \u2018grammar module.\u2019 \nFor instance, Rice and Wexler (1996) attribute SLI individuals' \nmorphological deficits to a missing UG principle, namely, the \nprinciple of inflection, and Van der Laly and Stollwerk 1997, \nattribute some SLI children's difficulty with anaphora to their \nfailure to acquire Binding Theory. Others see non-linguistic defects,\nsuch as auditory, memory or processing deficits as the root problem. \nFor instance, Tallal 1980, 1985 argue that many SLI cases result \nfrom deficits in the processing of rapid auditory stimuli, giving \nrise to a failure to learn to distinguish phonemes correctly, which \nin turn leads to a failure to acquire other aspects of grammar. \nOthers, such as and Norbury, Bishop and Briscoe 2002 argue that such \nchildren's limited processing capacities are the culprit.\n\n\nWhile the varied symptomatology of SLI suggests that no unified \ntheory of its etiology might be forthcoming, the cause of the \ndisorder is comparatively well understood in the case of one subtype,\ninvolving a severe disruption of morphosyntax (i.e., the rules \ngoverning the formation of words from smaller semantic units, or \nmorphemes). This subtype, seen in about half the members of a large, \nthree-generation English family, the KE's, and in another, unrelated \nindividual, has been traced to a specific genetic mutation, the \nfunction of which is actively under investigation.\n\n\nThe KE family has received much press since the early 1990s, when \nGopnik 1990a,b and Gopnik and Crago 1991 (see also Gopnik 1997) \nproposed that their morphosyntactic deficits were caused by a \nmutation in a single dominant gene normally responsible for the \nencoding of grammatical features, such as function words and the \ninflections used to mark number, tense, aspect, etc. According to \nGopnik, the affected KE's are \u2018feature blind\u2019 as a \nconsequence of this mutation. And according to Pinker (1994), their \npedigree (Fig. 6) and specifically morphosyntactic deficits \nconstitutes \u201csuggestive evidence for grammar genes \u2026 \ngenes whose effects seem most specific to the development of the \ncircuits underlying parts of grammar\u201d (Pinker 1994:325).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. The KE family pedigree \n (Image used by permission of Simon E. Fisher)\n \n\n\n\nOther intensive studies of the KE family, by Vargha-Khadem and\ncolleagues (e.g., Vargha-Khadem et al 1995, 1998;\nWatkins et al., 2002) have vigorously disputed the hypothesis\nthat the root cause of the KE's language disorder is a syntactic\ndeficit. Instead, they argue, the KE phenotype is much broader than\nGopnik's account suggests, and their \u2018feature blindness\u2019\nis merely one among the many effects of an underlying articulatory\nproblem. As characterized by Vargha-Khadem's team, the affected KE's\nspeech is effortful, \u201csometimes agrammatical and often\nunintelligible\u201d (Watkins et al. 2002:453), and shows\nimpairments not just in morphosyntax (e.g., regular plural and past\ntense endings) but also in the formation of irregular past tenses\n(where correct usage is lexically determined, rather than\nrule-governed) and in sentence-level syntax, particularly word order.\nComprehension, too, is impaired at the level of syntax as well as\nwords, and as is their reading of both words and non-words. These\nresults indicate that the KE's problems go beyond morphosyntax, and\nthe fact that affected KE's have significantly lower non-verbal IQs\n(by 18-19 points; Vargha-Khadem et al. 1995) than unaffected\nfamily members indicates that their deficits may be further reaching\n still.[28]\n Finally, affected KE's have trouble sequencing and executing\nnon-language-related face, mouth and tongue movements and show\nabnormal activation not just of speech but also of motor areas on fMRI\nscans (Liegeois, et al. 2003); this deficiency in\n\u2018orofacial praxis\u2019 supports Vargha-Khadem's hypothesis\nthat the root problem for the KE's is articulatory.\n\n\nAs Gopnik noted, the pattern of inheritance in the KE family suggests\nthat a single, dominant gene is responsible for the disorder. (See\nfig. 6) In the early 1990's, Fisher and colleagues began working to\nisolate the gene. First, it was localized to a region on chromosome\n7q31 containing about 100 genes (Fisher et al. 1997, 1998;\nO'Brien et al. 2003). Later, it was identified (Lai et\nal. 2001; Fisher et al. 2003) as the gene FOXP2, which encodes a\nregulatory protein or \u2018transcription factor\u2019 (i.e., a\nprotein that helps to regulate the rate of transcription of other\ngenes in the genome \u2014 in the case of FOXP2, the protein acts to\ninhibit transcription of the downstream gene(s)). In affected family\nmembers, a single base-pair substitution in the gene coding for this\nregulatory protein leads to the insertion of the amino acid arginine\n(instead of the normal histamine) in an area of the protein (viz., the\n\u2018forkhead binding domain\u2019) that is critical for its\nability to modulate the transcription of the downstream DNA. As a\nconsequence, FOXP2 cannot perform its normal regulatory role in\naffected KE family members.\n\n\nThe failure of FOXP2 to perform its normal role in turn leads to\nabnormal brain development in affected KE individuals. Studies of\nother animals and humans (e.g., Lai et al. 2003;\nTakahashi et al., 2003; Ferland et al. 2003;\nTeramitsu et al. 2004) show that FOXP2 is normally highly\nexpressed in both development and adulthood in two distinct brain\ncircuits, One is a corticostriatal circuit, in which inputs from the\nprefrontal and premotor cortex are modulated by the basal ganglia and\nthe thalamus, and then sent back to prefrontal and premotor cotical\nareas; the other is an olivocerebellar circuit, in which sensory input\nis sent via the spinal cord for processing in the medulla, cerebellum\nand thalamus before being handed on to prefrontal cortex. (See\nfig. 7.) The basal ganglia are known to be involved in the sequencing\nand reward-based learning of motor behaviors (Graybiel 1995, 1998),\nand the cerebellar circuit, while less well understood, is thought to\nbe a proprioceptive circuit involved in motor regulation and\ncoordination (Lieberman 2002). FOXP2 is expressed in homologues of\nthese areas in other species (e.g., canaries, zebra finches, rats) and\nin all species studied, these areas are involved in motor sequencing\nand coordination (Sharff and White 2004).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Two circuits in which FOXP2 is expressed. (Based on figures\nby Diana Weedman Molavi, The Washington University School of Medicine\n\n Neuroscience Tutorial).\n \n\n\nSo, what appears to be the case is that affected KE family members' \nlanguage difficulties result from a mutation in the FOXP2 gene, which\nresults in abnormal development of the striatal, cerebellar and \ncortical areas necessary for the sequencing and coordination of \nspeech-related movements of the mouth, tongue and possibly larynx; \nMRI scans of affected family members showing reduced gray matter \ndensity in these areas support this hypothesis, as do fMRI scans \nshowing abnormal striatal and cortical activation during receptive \nand active language processing (Belton et al. 2003; Liegeois, et \nal. 2003.)\n\n\nVargha-Khadem speculates (cf. Watkins et al. 2002:463) that those of\nthe KE's deficits that do not appear to be motor related (e.g., their\ncomprehension and reading problems, their difficulties with word \norder and syntax) are a result of impaired learning that itself \nresults from their motor deficits. For instance, impaired \narticulation could lead to impoverished phonological representations,\nwhich would then impair the acquisition of morphological and \nmorphosyntactic knowledge, which would then constitute a poor basis \nfor further syntactic learning. Impaired representation at all of \nthese levels would then express itself in receptive language and \nreading, as well as in the realm of spoken language. Another possible\nexplanation of the KE's non-articulatory deficits, which is not \nnecessarily in competition with the previous one, derives from the \nfact that the basal ganglia are also known to be implicated in \nworking memory (Bosnan 2004) and reward-based learning (e.g., \nclassical conditioning) that is mediated by dopaminergic circuits \nthat interact with basilar structures (Lieberman 2002). If \nreward-based learning and working memory are impaired in the KE's, \nthen this could explain not only their higher-level syntactic \ndeficits, but also their overall lower IQ (Lieberman 2002).\n\n\nNeither of these explanations of the KE's seems especially congenial \nto the linguistic nativist. For both tacitly assume that language \nlearning, including syntactic learning, is not (or not entirely) \nsubserved by special-purpose mechanisms. Rather, it is mediated by \nmore general motor circuitry (according to the Vargha-Khadem \nhypothesis) or reward-based learning and working memory abilities \n(according to Lieberman) that are also involved in other learning \ntasks.\n\n\nOn the other hand, however, there is evidence that FOXP2 is\nparticularly implicated in vocal learning and expression. First, it is\nhighly expressed in songbirds that modify their innate vocal\nrepertoires: in canaries it is expressed seasonally, when adult birds\nmodify their songs (Teramitsu et al. 2004) and in zebra\nfinches, it is expressed more at the time when young birds learn their\nsongs (Haessler et al. 2004). In addition, there is evidence\nthat the variant of the FOXP2 gene that is present in humans has\nundergone strong positive selection in the hominid line (Enard et\nal 2002; Zhang et al. 2002). The protein produced by\nhuman FOXP2 differs in just three out of its 715 constituent amino\nacids from that of the mouse, and a recent analysis (Zhang et\nal. 2003) indicates that two of these differences are unique to\nthe hominid lineage. According to Enard et al 2002, the fact\nthat these two differences are fixed in the human genome, whereas no\nfixed substitutions occurred in the lineage of our closest relatives,\nthe chimpanzees, suggests that those changes were strongly selected\nfor in our lineage; Enard et al.  put the date of fixation of\nthese changes in the human population at around 200,000 years\nago. This date accords well with at least some estimates of the\nemergence of modern human language, suggesting that the vocal\ncapacities underwritten by FOXP2 \u2014 and impaired in those lacking\nthe gene \u2014 are after all critical to language competence.\n3.6.3 The grammar module and the genetics of language\n\n\nAt this point, two questions arise. First, is there a double \ndissociation between language capacities and general cognitive \ncapacities to be found in a comparison of Williams syndrome and SLI? \nSecond, what does our current knowledge of the role of FOXP2 in \nlanguage development tell us about linguistic nativism?\n\n\nAs to the first question, there seems to be no double dissociation. \nFirst of all, WS individuals' language, while startling in contrast \nwith their level of mental retardation, is not normal; indeed, as we \nhave seen, it is indistinguishable on some tests from that of \nlanguage impaired individuals. In addition, as Thomas and \nKarmiloff-Smith 2002, caution, it is not at all clear that one can \nassume, in the case of a pervasive developmental disorder like \nWilliams syndrome, that apparently \u2018intact\u2019 competences \nare a result of normal development of the underlying neurological and\npsychological structures. That is, given the known capacity of the \nbrain to compensate for deficits in one area by cobbling together a \nsolution in another, one cannot assume that there is a \n\u2018language module\u2019 in WS patients which develops more or \nless normally despite other cognitive systems' being massively \ndisrupted. Thomas and Karmiloff-Smith argue that the numerous \ndiscrepancies between WS language development and that of normal \nchildren suggests that this \u2018residual normality\u2019 \nassumption is misguided in this case, thus undermining the claim that\nwhat is spared in WS is \u2018the language (or grammar) \nmodule.\u2019\n\n\nMoving to the other side of the dissociation, since it is hard to say\nexactly what about language is disrupted in cases of SLI, it is\ndifficult to determine whether this disruption is specific to\nlanguage, let alone grammar. While researchers like Van der Lely and\nChristian 2000, and van der Lely and Ullman 2001 argue that there is\na purely grammatical form of the deficit, which does support the\nhypothesis of a grammar module, this is controversial, as we have seen\nabove. Certainly consideration of the KE's does not support such a\nhypothesis. Their root deficit appears to concern orofacial praxis,\nrather than language specifically; and in addition, their\n\u2018general intelligence,\u2019 as measured by tests of non-verbal\nintelligence, while \u201cnormal,\u201d nonetheless appears to have\nbeen affected by their neurological and/or linguistic abnormalities\n\u2014 witness their scores 18-19 points lower than those of their\nrelatives. It is, in other words, unclear that there is any\ndissociation of language and general intelligence in this case at\nall. One can conclude that as things stand now, SLI seems to be so\nheterogeneous a disorder as to defy neat characterization, and that\nconsideration of this disorder does not support the view that there is\na language or grammar module that functions independently of other\ncognitive processes.\n\n\nThe second question asked above was: what can be learned about the \ninnate basis of language from a consideration of the KE's and FOXP2. \nIn a recent article, Marcus and Fisher (2003) argue that the kinds of\nresults discussed above offer valuable insights into the ways that \nlanguage is implemented in the brain and controlled (to the extent \nthat it is) by the genes. However, they refrain \u2014 rightly in my\nview \u2014 from drawing morals to the effect that FOXP2 is a \n\u201cgene for language\u201d or even \u201cfor \narticulation.\u201d The effects of FOXP2 are wider than this (it is \nexpressed in the developing heart and lungs, in addition to the brain\n-- REF) and the functions of the neural circuits in which it is \nactive are as yet too poorly understood to do more than gesture at \nthe ways in which FOXP2 is involved in constructing the human \nlinguistic phenotype.\n\n\nAll the topics covered in \u00a73 deserve books of their own. My aim\nhere has been to sketch the ways in which modern understanding of the\nmind reveals the inadequacy and implausibility of the claim that\nhumans have innate representations of UG that are responsible for\ntheir acquisition of language. There are likely many, many processes\nimplicated in the attainment of linguistic competence, that many of\nthem are likely specialized by natural selection for linguistic tasks,\nbut that many of them also retain their other, and older,\nfunctions. The linguistic nativist's theory views our acquisition of\ngrammatical competence as a simple matter \u2014 one that\ncan be described at one level of explanation, and in terms of a single\nkind of process. This is very unlikely to be the case. Multiple\nsystems and multiple processes are at work in the acquisition of\nlinguistic knowledge, and our understanding of language acquisition,\nwhen it comes, is likely to involve theories of many kinds and at many\ndifferent levels, and to resemble the theory of the Chomskyan nativist\nin few or no\n respects.[29]\n",
