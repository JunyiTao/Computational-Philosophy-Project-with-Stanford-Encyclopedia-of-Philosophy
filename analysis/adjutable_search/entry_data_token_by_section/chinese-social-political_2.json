    "main_text": "The Classical Era || Guanzi: Carrot and Stick\n2.1 Guanzi: Carrot and Stick\n\nThe earliest chapters of the Guanzi, which were composed in\nthe state of Qi and date from the mid-4th century BCE, are\namong the first theoretical writings on governance. In a famous\npassage from \u201cShepherding the People\u201d, we find that\n\u201cSuccess in government lies in following the hearts of the\npeople\u201d. Success is not defined as making the people\nhappy\u2014we learn elsewhere that success for the ruler is having a\nstrong state that endures through the ages\u2014but following the\npeople\u2019s wishes turns out to be a necessary condition for\nsuccess. Thus:\n\n\nWhen the granaries are full, the people will know propriety and\nmoderation; when their clothing and food are adequate, they will know\nthe distinction between honor and shame.\n\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\nIf the ruler can ensure the people their existence and provide them\nwith security, they will be willing to endure danger and disaster for\nhim. (GZ ch. 1, pp. 54 and 52)\n\n\nThis is not to say that the people should be given free reign. If they\nare well fed and put to work at tasks well-suited to them, they are\nlikely to accord with propriety and moderation, but the author adds\nthat rulers must \u201cMake clear the road to certain death\u201d,\nby which he means \u201chaving severe punishments\u201d for those\nwho go astray (GZ ch. 1, p. 55). In another chapter of the text,\npossibly by the same author, we find:\n\n\nThose who shepherd the people desire them to be controllable. Since\nthey desire them to be controllable, they must pay serious attention\nto standards (fa). (GZ ch. 3, p. 98)\n\n\nThese \u201cstandards\u201d are then enumerated to include honoring\nranks and ceremonial dress, giving salaries and rewards to the\ndeserving, granting offices, and applying punishments. The\nGuanzi thus presents us with versions of the two techniques\nof governance that will run throughout the texts of the Warring\nStates: nurturing the people and setting them standards.\n",
