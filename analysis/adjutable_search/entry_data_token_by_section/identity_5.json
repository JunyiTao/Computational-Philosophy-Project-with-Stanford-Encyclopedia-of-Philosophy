    "main_text": "Identity across possible worlds\n6. Identity across possible worlds\n\nIn the interpretation of modal discourse recourse is often made to the\nidea of \u201cidentity across possible worlds\u201d. If modal\ndiscourse is interpreted in this way it becomes natural to regard a\nstatement ascribing a modal property to an individual as asserting the\nidentity of that individual across worlds: \u201cSarah might\nhave been a millionaire\u201d, on this view, asserts that there is a\npossible world in which an individual identical with Sarah is a\nmillionaire. \u201cSarah could not have been a\nmillionaire\u201d asserts that in any world in which an individual\nidentical with Sarah exists that individual is not a\nmillionaire.\n\nHowever, though this is perhaps the most natural way to interpret\nde re modal statements (once it has been accepted that the\napparatus of possible worlds is to be used as an interpretative tool),\nthere are well-known difficulties that make the approach\nproblematic.\n\nFor example, it seems reasonable to suppose that a complex artefact\nlike a bicycle could have been made of different parts. On the other\nhand, it does not seem right that the same bicycle could have been\nconstructed out of completely different parts.\n\nBut now consider a series of possible worlds, beginning with the\nactual world, each containing a bicycle just slightly different from\nthe one in the previous world, the last world in the sequence being\none in which there is a bicycle composed of completely different parts\nfrom the one in the actual world. One cannot say that each bicycle is\nidentical with the one in the neighbouring world, but not identical\nwith the corresponding bicycle in distant worlds, since identity is\ntransitive. Hence it seems one must either adopt an extreme\nmereological essentialism, according to which no difference of parts\nis possible for an individual, or reject the interpretation of de\nre modal discourse as asserting identity across possible\nworlds.\n\nThis and other problems with cross-world identity suggest that some\nother weaker relation, of similarity or what David Lewis calls\ncounterparthood, should be employed in a possible world analysis of\nmodal discourse. Since similarity is not transitive this allows us to\nsay that the bicycle might have had some different parts without\nhaving to say that it might have been wholly different. On the other\nhand, such a substitution does not seem unproblematic, for a claim\nabout what I might have done hardly seems, at first sight, to\nbe correctly interpretable as a claim about what someone else\n(however similar to me) does in another possible world (Kripke 1972\n[1980], note 13).\n\nAn assessment of the counterpart theoretic analysis is vital not just\nto understanding modal discourse, however, but also to getting to the\ncorrect account of identity over time. For, as we saw, the argument\nagainst perdurance theory outlined at the end of the last section\ndepends on the correct interpretation of modal discourse. In fact, it\nis invalid on a counterpart theoretic analysis which allows different\ncounterpart relations (different similarity relations) to be invoked\naccording to the sense of the singular term which is the subject of\nthe de re modal predication (Lewis 1986, Ch. 4), since the\ncounterpart relation relevant to the assessment of a de re\nmodal predication with a singular term whose sense determines that it\nrefers to a person will be different from that relevant to the\nassessment of a de re modal predication with a singular term\nwhose sense determines that it refers to a sum of person-stages.\n\u201cI might have existed for only five years\u201d means on the\nLewisian account \u201cThere is a person in some possible world\nsimilar to me in those respects important to personhood who exists for\nonly five years\u201d; \u201cThe maximal summation of person stages\nof which this current stage is a stage might have existed for only\nfive years\u201d means \u201cThere is a summation of person stages\nsimilar to this one in those respects important to the status of an\nentity as a summation of stages which exists for only five\nyears\u201d. Since the two similarity relations in question are\ndistinct the first modal statement may be true and the second false\neven if I am identical with the sum of stages in question.\n\nCounterpart theory is also significant to the topic of identity over\ntime in another way, since it provides the analogy to which the stage\ntheorist (who regards all everyday reference as reference to momentary\nstages rather than to perdurers) appeals to explain de re\ntemporal predication. Thus, according to the stage theorist, just as\n\u201cI might have been fat\u201d does not require the existence of\na possible world in which an object identical with me is fat, but only\nthe existence of a world in which a (modal) counterpart of me is fat,\nso \u201cI used to be fat\u201d does not require the existence of a\npast time at which someone identical with (the present momentary stage\nwhich is) me was fat, but only the existence of a past time at which a\n(temporal) counterpart of me was fat. The problem of identity over\ntime for things of a kind, for stage theorists, is just the problem of\ncharacterizing the appropriate temporal counterpart relation for\nthings of that kind.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion of the topic, see the entry\n transworld identity.\n Whether de re modal discourse is to be interpreted in terms\nof identity across possible worlds or counterpart theoretically (or in\nsome other way entirely) is also relevant to our next topic, that of\ncontingent identity.\n",
