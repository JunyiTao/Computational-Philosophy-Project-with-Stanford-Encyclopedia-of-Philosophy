September 1521 letter to Guillaume\nBud\u00e9 [EW 1376.9]), has been recognized as one of the\nforemost early modern humanists in England, particularly in view of\nhis well-known Utopia and his History of King Richard\nIII. Whether years later Chancellor More remained such a man, or\nbecame repressive in his outlook and action, remains a topic of\ncontroversy. After law school and the best education available in\nLondon and Oxford, More mastered ancient Greek and encouraged Erasmus\nto do so as well, convinced of the need to return to the sources of\nclassical and biblical thought. Throughout his life he stressed the\nimportance of philosophy; he himself devoted his early morning hours\nto study and reflection even during his busiest years\u2014as is\nevidenced by the twenty books, the 291 poems, and the surviving 151\nletters that he wrote in the midst of an active civic life. He\nidentified himself frequently as a \u201ccitizen of London\u201d and\nwas known as a distinguished lawyer, judge, member of Parliament,\nambassador, and prominent proponent of women\u2019s education; he\nbecame Speaker of the House of Commons, Chancellor of the Duchy of\nLancaster, then for three years Lord Chancellor of England and\nprosecutor of heretics under King Henry VIII. In taking the oath of\noffice as Chancellor, More swore to uphold England\u2019s\n128-year-old heresy laws and, while he was in office, six individuals\nwere convicted of heresy by ecclesiastical courts and then executed\nunder secular law. He himself was executed for failing to recognize\nthe legislation of 1532\u201334 making Henry VIII head of the Church\nof England and for failing to support the king\u2019s divorce from\nCatherine of Aragon and marriage to Anne Boleyn.\n\nThis entry is limited to Thomas More\u2019s understanding and\npractice of philosophy, enlightened, as he believed it to be, by\nbiblical revelation. Intellectually, he was most deeply indebted to\nPlato, Aristotle, Cicero, Seneca, the Bible, and the Latin and Greek\nChurch Fathers (especially Augustine, Jerome, Basil, and Chrysostom;\nsee Concordances in\n Other Internet Resources).\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nAccording to Erasmus, the young Thomas More \u201cdevoted himself to\nthe study of Greek literature and philosophy\u201d, and\n\n\n[a]s a youth even worked on a dialogue in which he supported\nPlato\u2019s doctrine of communalism, extending it even to wives. (23\nJuly 1519 letter to Ulrich von Hutten [EW 1372.6\u20137;\n1373.93\u201396])\n\n\nCommenting on the older More, Erasmus described him as having a\n\u201cclearly philosophic character\u201d (late 1532 letter to John\nFaber [EW 1378.56]) and a home that could rightly be called\n\u201canother Platonic academy\u201d but which gave first place to\npiety, Scripture, and the wisest and most saintly Church Fathers (late\n1532 [EW 1380.51] and 22 May <1518> letter to William\nGonell [EW 289\u201390]). It was also a home in which his\ndaughters received the same education as his son (c. September 1521\nletter to Guillaume Bud\u00e9 [EW 1375\u201376]). As the\nMore scholar Elizabeth McCutcheon recently summarized the education of\nMore\u2019s daughters, it was\n\n\nbased on a study of Greek and Latin texts, \u2026 all the liberal\nand humane arts (grammar, rhetoric, logic, poetry, mathematics,\nphilosophy, and astronomy) as well as theology and medicine.\n(McCutcheon 2022: 130)\n\n\nBoth Erasmus and Richard Pace described More as a second Democritus,\nthe \u201claughing philosopher\u201d (Curtis 2006b: 91, 94). Pace\nreported about More that \u201c[t]here is no school of philosophy he\ndoesn\u2019t approve of in part\u201d but added that his special\ntalent was for revealing the \u201cridiculous\u201d (Pace:\n105)\u2014a special focus, as we will see, of More\u2019s epigrams.\nFor Socrates, ridiculous people (a common theme of the young More) are\nthose who are mistaken about themselves, those who have not followed\nthe Delphic \u201cknow thyself\u201d prescript (Plato,\nPhilebus 48c). More wrote that his favorite comic dialogue\nwriter, Lucian, used \u201cSocratic irony\u201d (<1506> letter\nto Thomas Ruthall [EW 20.59]), and he praised Lucian for\n\u201cfulfill[ing] the Horatian maxim and combining delight with\ninstruction\u201d while \u201c[r]efraining from the arrogant\npronouncements of the philosophers as well as from the wanton wiles of\nthe poets\u201d (<1506> [EW 20.7\u201311]). Erasmus\nshared More\u2019s admiration for Lucian, who\n\n\nso effectively portrays the manners, emotions, and pursuits of men, as\nif with a painter\u2019s vivid brush, not so much inviting us to read\nabout them as to see them with our own eyes, that \u2026 there is\nnot a comedy, or a satire, that challenges comparison with his\ndialogues. (June 1506 letter to Christopher Urswick [CWE\n2.116.51\u201355])\n\n\nMore studied Greek with the Italian-educated classical scholars\nWilliam Grocyn, Thomas Linacre, and William Lily, and was\n\u201cfaithful to Aristotelian realism\u201d (CW 6: 534; 23\nOctober <1504> letter to John Colet [EW\n270.75\u201378]; 21 October 1515 letter to Martin Dorp [EW\n412.31\u201332]; Barron 2011: 11; McConica 2011: 25\u201326; Curtis\n2011: 72). More presents a \u201cphilosophically sophisticated\u201d\ntreatment of dialectic and language in his \u201cLetter to\nDorp\u201d (Kinney 1981: 180; EW 391\u2013416), where he\nexplains that the meanings of words depend on custom and common usage\n(EW 398, CW 15: 35) and that true dialectics is an\n\u201cintellectual exercise\u201d whose \u201cgoal is the truth and\nnot winning a quarrel\u201d (EW 407.59\u201360,\n67\u201368; CW 15: 75). Nonetheless, in that same letter\nMore shows his characteristic independence of mind by saying that he\nesteems Aristotle \u201cmore than many, but still along with\nmany\u201d (EW 411.80\u201381, SL 52).\n\nHis early biographer Thomas Stapleton remarked that among\n\u201cphilosophers [More] read especially Plato\u201d and that\n\u201cin his own works he imitated Plato\u2019s manner of\nwriting\u201d (1588 [1928: 15]). This imitation has been noted in\nrecent studies of Utopia (Sch\u00f6n 2022; Nelson 2004;\nBaker-Smith 1994; Duncan 1979) but rarely in writings on More\u2019s\nother Socratic dialogues, although his \u201cdialogic\u201d cast of\nmind has long been recognized in various studies (recently: Gardner\nRodgers 2011: 243; also E. McCutcheon 2011: 58\u201359; Renner 2018:\n51, 54\u201362).\n2. Plato\u2019s Socrates: the \u201cbest philosopher\u201d\n\nOf all philosophers More gave pride of place to \u201cPlato\nalone\u201d (1520 letter to Brixius [EW 468.38, CW\n3.2: 643]), describing him as \u201cthe great philosopher\u201d and\n\u201cwise\u201d (1529 Dialogue of Sir Thomas More, Knight\n[EW 681.12, 29, CW 6: 334.23, 335.2]). Plato\u2019s\nSocrates, whom More called \u201cthe best philosopher\u201d, defined\nphilosophy as (in More\u2019s paraphrasing) \u201cthe meditation or\nexercise of [i.e., the preparation for] death\u201d since \u201cthe\nstudy of philosophy labor[s] to sever the soul from the love and\naffections of the body while they be together\u201d (1522 Four\nLast Things [EW 482.41\u201352]). As More expressed it\nin one of his early works, Socrates achieved \u201cmerry\ncheer\u201d, \u201cwisdom\u201d, and \u201cliberty\u201d by\nescaping the \u201cbondage\u201d of Fortune and by understanding the\n\u201csecret draughts [i.e., designs] of nature\u201d (c. 1504\n\u201cFortune Verses\u201d [EW 14\u201315]).\n\nMore\u2019s Socrates was primarily concerned with ethics. In\npresenting Socrates\u2019 definition of philosophy as a preparation\nfor death, More was alluding to Plato\u2019s Phaedo, in\nwhich Socrates argues that the true philosopher must be freed from\nbodily appetites and pleasures that hinder the soul from reaching\ntruth, virtue, and wisdom (963e\u201367e). In the Phaedo,\nSocrates also provocatively calls the body a prison of the soul (82e)\nand says he is looking forward to the liberty that death will provide\nhis soul (1522, Four Last Things [EW\n482.42\u201343]). Throughout his writings, More also frequently drew\nattention to the distortions in perception caused by the senses and\nthe undisciplined passions, but his incarnational view consistently\ncaused him to acknowledge that the body and soul are \u201cso knit\nand joined together\u201d as to \u201cmake between them one\nperson\u201d, able to act harmoniously with proper education,\ndiligent training, and recourse to grace (1534 Dialogue of\nComfort [EW 1176.59\u201360]; also c. 1510 Life of\nPico [EW 85.30, 61\u201362; 90.15\u201393.210;\n94.82]).\n\nMore, following Augustine (Augustine, The Trinity, Books\n9\u201310), saw the soul as created in the image of God by reason, at\nleast in part, of being endowed \u201cwith the three great gifts,\nmemory, understanding, and will, in a certain manner of resemblance of\nthe \u2026 Trinity\u201d (c. 1510 Life of Pico\n[EW 74.62\u201365, 89.61\u201362]; 1534 Treatise on the\nPassion [EW 1031.32\u201335]). He saw as well that\n\u201cbrutish appetites\u201d can \u201cmake the soul leave the\nnoble use of his reason\u201d\u2014thus \u201cturn[ing] the image\nof God into a beast\u201d (EW 74). One of More\u2019s most\nfrequent themes, from his first published work to his last, was the\ncharacter of that \u201cspiritual battle\u201d needed to allow\n\u201creason to rule as a king\u201d\u2014and therefore\nfacilitating liberty through law, i.e., through law as reason embodied\nover time for the good of all.\n\nMore addressed the question of how one frees the soul \u201cfor truth\nand right reason in all things\u201d (1506 Lucian Dialogues\n[EW 44.17]) in a series of rhyme royal poems (i.e., in\nseven-line iambic pentameter stanzas rhyming ababbcc) about the\nspiritual life in his most extensive addition to the first of his\npublications in English, The Life of John Pico, Earl of\nMirandola. There More developed \u201cTwelve Rules\u201d and\n\u201cTwelve Weapons\u201d of \u201cSpiritual Battle\u201d needed\nto achieve joy through virtue and conscience, since \u201cOf virtue\nmore joy the conscience hath within / Than outward the body of all his\nfilthy sin\u201d (EW 87.139\u201340) and so \u201cThou\nshalt no pleasure comparable find / To th\u2019inward gladness of a\nvirtuous mind\u201d (EW 89.74\u201375.) To distinguish this\napproach from that of the Stoics, he also developed in rhyme royal\nverse what he called \u201cThe Twelve Properties \u2026 of a\nLover\u201d. This love ballad makes clear that a \u201cperfect\nlover\u201d will gladly \u201csuffer trouble, pain, and woe\u201d\nfor his human beloved, and all the more so for God (EW\n90\u201393).\n\nThis early set of poems on the \u201cspiritual battle\u201d was\nfollowed by prose writings such as The Four Last Things and\nportions of his Dialogue of Sir Thomas More, Knight. These\nwritings concerned the \u201cspiritual exercise by which the soul\nwillingly worketh with the body\u201d to cultivate \u201cinward\nspiritual pleasure\u201d based on neither \u201cfalse\nimagination\u201d nor \u201cvain pleasures of the flesh\u201d but\non a very true contemplation\u201d and \u201cthe very pleasures of\nthe soul\u201d (1529 Dialogue of Sir Thomas More, Knight\n[EW 480, 488]). Regarding this \u201cspiritual\nbusiness\u201d of cultivating the soul \u201cto rule and bridle\nsensuality\u201d and to be \u201csubject and obedient to\nreason\u201d (EW 584.67\u201371), More alludes regularly to\nthe Phaedrus, where Socrates says that the reasoning\ncharioteer must bridle and govern his passionate horses (EW\n15.271, 26.15\u201336, 577.1\u20132, 580.83, 581.54,\n584.69\u201371, 1101.56, 1232.71\u201372, 1350.46\u201347). More\nalso urges his readers to cultivate the \u201cgarden of our\nsoul\u201d by engendering, planting, and watering in it the\n\u201cspiritual affections\u201d that God \u201cby sundry means\ninstructeth our reason to lean unto\u201d (1534 Dialogue of\nComfort [EW 1232.52\u201366]; also 1522 Four Last\nThings [EW 477.49\u201350]; 1529 Dialogue of Sir\nThomas More, Knight [EW 584.34\u201335]).\n3. Early Poetry, Conscience, and Philosophic Considerations\n\nLord Chancellor and Archbishop John Morton marveled at the\ntwelve-year-old More\u2019s extraordinary theatrical ability to\n\n\nstep in among the players, and never studying for the matter, make a\npart of his own there presently among them, which made the lookers-on\nmore sport than all the players besides. (Roper\u2019s Life of\nSir Thomas More [EW 1391.10\u201314])\n\n\nReflecting on this passage and on More\u2019s early poetry and life,\nRichard Sylvester\u2014the Yale scholar who launched the Complete\nWorks project\u2014observed that he had, even from that early\nage, an awareness \u201cof himself in relation to others\u201d,\nshowing \u201cconscience in the old sense of the word, \u2018a\nknowing with\u2019\u201d that always enabled him to determine a\n\u201cpart of his own\u201d (1967: 30).\n\nIn his earliest known poem, \u201cPageant Verses\u201d (c. 1496\n[EW 3\u20134, CW 1: 3\u20137]), More shows his\nflair for dramatic representations of life. Each of the nine\nfirst-person monologues expresses, in rhyme royal verse, a different\nand fitting perspective about the ages of life and their specific\ncharacteristics (EW 3\u20134), each with a touch of humor.\nThe poem not only includes in its scope the full scale of life\n(following the ages-of-man trope of Childhood, Youth, Maturity, Old\nAge) and what follows one\u2019s earthly life (Death, Fame,\nTime, and a secular Eternity), but also ends, in Latin, with the\nPoet\u2019s view of all that preceded in the light of a loving God,\nthe one true good\u2014and the Poet\u2019s challenge for the reader\nto reflect and choose.\n\n\u201cPageant Verses\u201d begins with Childhood boasting of his\nstage of life: \u201c[I]n play is all my mind\u201d. Childhood\nhumorously calls upon God twice to enable him to play games all day;\nto have all those \u201chateful books\u201d burned \u201cto powder\nsmall\u201d, and thus send him a \u201clife always in play\u201d.\nThis stanza brings out the power of pleasure\u2019s allure\u2014as\ndo the following few stanzas, and as will Utopia and\nMore\u2019s later works. But the child does naturally turn to God in\nthose lines (17 and 20), and in lines 14 and 20 he reveals an\nawareness of his own mind and of death. The next stanzas dramatize the\npursuit of pleasure in different forms according to the particular age\nof life, but all show the prominence of pride: each speaker ups the\nboast, explaining how their pleasure or power exceeds that of the one\nbefore. Even the old ruler boasts\u2014of his wisdom and discretion\nin achieving the \u201cpublic weal\u201d\u2014in the stanza\nentitled \u201cAge\u201d.\n\n\u201cRueful Lamentation\u201d (EW 5\u20136)\u2014written\nin 1503, when More was twenty-five\u2014is a moving first-person\nmonologue by Queen Elizabeth of York (the mother of Henry VIII) on her\ndeathbed, bearing witness to what the Poet of \u201cPageant\nVerses\u201d said about the \u201cgoods of th[is] fragile\nworld\u201d being \u201cslippery\u201d. Queen Elizabeth makes this\npoint powerfully in the concluding refrain for each of her twelve\nstanzas: \u201cLo, here I lie\u201d. More\u2019s last two English\npoems, written in prison, are also about \u201cflattering\nFortune\u201d and unreliable \u201cLady Luck\u201d (c. 1534\n[EW 16]).\n\nMore\u2019s greatest English poem is \u201cThe Fortune Verses\u201d\n(c. 1504), a dialogue between Lady Fortune and two other speakers with\ndiffering perspectives (EW 12\u201316). As one scholar put\nit:\n\n\nMore\u2019s Fortune Verses present a three-way dialectical\nconsideration of how best to live one\u2019s life in the world\ncontrolled by Fortune. The poem is shown to progress from speaker to\nspeaker in its several parts, in order to present an increasingly\naccurate understanding of the person of Fortune and her relationship\nto human life. (Mock 2011: 69)\n\n\nThe speaker in the opening Prologue is identified as\n\u201cT.M.\u201d and the meter is rhyme royal, the form, as we have\nseen, that More used most frequently in his other early poetry. This\nspeaker addresses the reader directly in his fifty lines, giving a\nsimplistic and entirely negative view of Fortune. This speaker even\nquotes, in French, a poet dismissing Fortune as \u201cperverse\u201d\nand the cause of all evils. The 250 lines that follow, however, are an\nengaging dialogue\u2014not at all simplistic\u2014between Lady\nFortune and an exceptionally wise and persuasive interlocutor, all\nwith More\u2019s customary humor.\n\nIn the Fortune Verses, More dramatizes how human beings contend with\nthe powerful allure of Fortune\u2019s fleeting goods. He gives the\nexamples of \u201cwise Socrates\u201d and other \u201cold\nphilosophers\u201d who achieved \u201cfelicity\u201d and\n\u201cfree liberty\u201d by choosing \u201cglad Poverty\u201d\ninstead of Fortune. This choice led them to a \u201cwisdom\u201d\nresulting in happiness rather than wretchedness (EW\n14\u201315). By choosing poverty, Socrates and like-minded\nphilosophers chose only \u201cwhat nature may sustain, / Banishing\nclear all other surplusage\u201d (EW 14.210\u201311; also\n1201ff). The nature of \u201cfree liberty\u201d, along with its\nrelations to wisdom and virtue is one of More\u2019s major themes\nthroughout his writings.\n\nThese early poems show More\u2019s preoccupation with challenging the\nreader to participate in, to reflect on, and, as the Poet of the\n\u201cPageant Verses\u201d puts it, to \u201cnourish his\nsoul\u201d on \u201ctrue things\u201d through the \u201cfashioned\nfigures\u201d of \u201cwondrous art\u201d (EW 4). This\nyouthful focus on truth and wonder is another early sign of\nMore\u2019s philosophic cast of mind.\n4. Augustine; Lucian\u2019s Humorous Dialectical Engagement\n\nIn 1501, at the age of 23, More was invited by William Grocyn, the\nrector of St. Lawrence Jewry in central London, to give lectures on\nAugustine\u2019s City of God. According to Thomas Stapleton,\nMore \u201cdid not treat this great work from the theological point\nof view, but from the standpoint of history and philosophy\u201d\n(1588 [1928: 8\u20139]). In the same year, under Grocyn\u2019s\ninstruction, he began the serious study of Greek (EW 269.21,\n24). He mastered it in three years\u2014to such an extent that he\ncould then challenge Erasmus to a Greek-translating contest that\nresulted in his first publication, in 1506 of Lucian Dialogues and\nDeclamations (EW 17\u201359; CW 3.1]). \n\nIn choosing the content of this first publication, as R. R. McCutcheon\nobserved, \u201cThomas More began his career as a dialogist \u2026\nby collaborating with Erasmus as a translator of Lucian\u201d (1993:\n357). The three Lucian dialogues that More translated all humorously\nsatirize supposed philosophers\u2019 \u201carrogant\npronouncements\u201d and \u201cfruitless contentions\u201d (1510\nEW 20.10, 56). For the same publication, More also challenged\nErasmus to write responses to a declamation on tyrannicide\u2014a\nsurprising topic for a first original publication, revealing, as\nErasmus would later point out, his friend\u2019s \u201cspecial\nhatred of tyranny\u201d (1519 letter to von Hutten [EW\n1371.17]). More\u2019s declamation set forth a theory about tyranny\nand how the tyrant differs from other criminal leaders. The\ndeclamation also speaks of civic liberty and the type of civic virtues\nneeded to maintain liberty, that \u201cmost precious\u201d gift\nwilled by the gods (1506 EW 59.13\u201341).\n\nMore\u2019s choice to translate three comic depictions of philosophic\nconfusion calls to mind The City of God\u2019s lengthy\nexpositions of the perennial disagreements among philosophers.\nAugustine cites, for example, the failure of philosophers to agree on\nany \u201cuniversal\u201d guide to life (10.41); the ongoing\n\u201cwars\u201d between schools of thought, resulting in its own\nBabel (18.41); Varro\u2019s distinguishing 288 different sects of\nphilosophy (19.1); and Cicero\u2019s admission that only a very few\nachieve \u201ctrue philosophy\u201d\u2014and that by a gift from\nGod (22.22). Throughout his life More quoted Augustine more than any\nother author (see Concordances in\n Other Internet Resources),\n but nonetheless he early on wrote:\n\n\nBeing a man, [Augustine] could make a mistake. I take his word as\nseriously as anyone\u2019s, but I take no man\u2019s word\nunconditionally. (21 October <1515> letter to Martin Dorp\n[EW 405. 5\u20137; CW 15: 69.4\u20136])\n\n\nMore affirmed this independence of mind dramatically at the end of his\nlife, in prison:\n\n\nI never intend (God being my good lord) to pin my soul at another\nman\u2019s back, not even the best man that I know this day living,\nfor I know not wither he may hap to carry it. There is no man living\nof whom, while he liveth, I may make myself sure. (<August 1534>\nletter of Margaret Roper to Alice Alington [EW\n1314.52\u201357])\n\n\nFor his own children, More insisted on an education ordered to\n\u201cgood judgment\u201d and the ability to listen to popular\nopinion without being overly swayed by it (<1521> letter to\nMargaret Roper [EW 314.79\u201380]; 22 May <1518>\nletter to William Gonell [EW 289.80\u201383]). A main reason\nfor his decision to translate Lucian\u2019s comic dialogues was the\nGreek satirist\u2019s \u201cfirst rate\u201d ability to probe\ndeeply without disturbing the reader\u2019s \u201cequanimity\n[aequo animo]\u201d (1506 letter to Ruthall [EW 20\nn.1]). Like Socrates, More\u2019s major philosophic interest was the\nproperly ordered soul equipped to seek truth and virtue not victory\nand applause (c. 1518 letter to Gonell [EW 288\u201390]).\nBut unlike Socrates, More\u2019s final Socratic dialogues make clear\nthat truth and virtue can be found\u2014with the assistance of\nrevelation\u2014and not merely sought.\n5. Towards a \u201cCivil\u201d Philosophy: Life of Pico, Epigrams, Richard III\n\nIn 1510, More found an occasion to publish a work he had begun years\nearlier, having undoubtedly been introduced to Giovanni Pico della\nMirandola by his friends and teachers who had studied in Italy, where\nthe \u201cPrince of Concord\u201d was well known (Sylvester 1967:\n35). Pico\u2019s nephew and heir, Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola,\npublished in 1496 a 496\u2013page biography of his uncle and\nanthology of his works. More\u2019s highly edited 34\u2013page\nbiography and anthology radically re-envisioned Pico\u2019s life and\nphilosophic project. As the historian James McConica has pointed out,\neverything\n\n\nforeign to More\u2019s thoroughly orthodox outlook is eliminated; of\nall the sources for Pico\u2019s thought in the original version, only\nThomas Aquinas is singled out for mention. (1981: 65; see also\nKoterski 2010: 61).\n\n\nIn his version of The Life of John Pico, More modified the\ntexts he translated to register his disagreement with Pico\u2019s\nunderstanding of philosophy. Contrary to Pico\u2019s own aristocratic\nview that the \u201cprincely practice\u201d of philosophy should\nnever be \u201cmercenary\u201d or \u201cservile\u201d (EW\n77.79\u201382, 78.45, 86.33), More adds repeatedly, with comic irony,\nthat philosophy brings \u201cprofit\u201d (EW 63.37, 46;\n68.27; 78.14), especially by providing \u201cinstruction \u2026 in\nmoral virtue\u201d (see More\u2019s addition at EW\n77.84\u201385). As the editor of the Yale edition of The Life of\nPico observes, More\u2019s many omissions, selections, and\nadditions are \u201cconcerned to emphasize the necessity of the\nactive life\u201d and to show the insufficiency of \u201cthe\nreclusive life of the solitary scholar\u201d (CW 1: xlviii).\nIn this way, More adds a Ciceronian and Senecan perspective, casting\nphilosophy as a most useful\n art[1]\n while deftly criticizing\n Pico[2]\n for not fulfilling important duties of the \u201ccivil and active\nlife\u201d (EW 77.89\u201390), and for insisting that\n\u201cphilosophers love liberty; \u2026 they cannot serve\u201d\n(EW 78.56, 58)\u2014thus neglecting the ordinary duties of\neveryday life, as will Raphael Hythloday in Utopia.\n\nThe dangers of an active civic life as well as the consequences of\nneglect by civic leaders are seen in More\u2019s History of King\nRichard III (ca. 1513), a work never published during\nhis own lifetime despite the much revised and differing versions he\ndrafted in Latin and English. In both versions More dramatized how\nhuman beings use their reason to decide not to follow reason. King\nEdward IV, for example, ends up tragically \u201ctaking counsel of\n\u2026 desire\u201d rather than of reason (EW 124.51).\nQueen Elizabeth Woodville (Edward\u2019s wife), despite the powerful\nreasons she gave for not abandoning her young and sick son to the\n\u201cwolf\u201d Richard, goes against those reasons and freely\nhands him over. This same foolish propensity to follow passion rather\nthan reason is a major topic of More\u2019s many satirical epigrams\n(e.g., Epigrams 199, 210, and 214). His satires point to the\nimportance of self-knowledge and of a well-ordered and peaceful state\nof soul so that reason is unhindered from making a \u201cgood\njudgment\u201d (<1521> letter to Margaret Roper [EW\n314.79\u201380]); these are the educational goals More set for his\nchildren and for himself (<1518> letter to Gonell [EW\n288\u201390]).\n\nThe 102 of More\u2019s Latin poems that are translations from the\nGreek, combined with his own 179 original epigrams, show his interest\nin the full scope of human life. As the editors of the Yale edition\nput it, More\u2019s \u201crefreshing new range of subjects\u201d\nmakes us\n\n\nfeel we are leaving the study of a scholar or a cleric and entering\nthe world of merchants, lawyers, and courtiers\u2026. It is this\nvivid interest in life in all its aspects that makes More\u2019s\nEpigrammata incomparably the best book of Latin epigrams in\nthe sixteenth century. (CW 3.2: 62, 63)\n\n\nA large number of these witty poems highlight the ridiculous, but many\nof the most distinctive ones are political and address the question of\ntyranny versus good rule. To quote the Yale editors again:\nMore\u2019s\n\n\nfavorite concern is for the difference between a good king and a\ntyrant, but it is evident from a reading of this group of epigrams\nthat, whereas the existence of good kings is a theoretical\npossibility, the existence of tyrants is a present danger.\n(CW 3.2: 62)\n\n\nIn fact, his criticisms of King Henry VII in Epigram 19 were so severe\nthat soon after More published these poems the French humanist\nGermanus Brixius (Germain de Brie) accused him of defaming the monarch\n(c. 1519 Antimorus [CW 3.2: 493, 495])\u2014an\naccusation so serious that More was advised to fight to protect\nhimself (<March\u2013 April 1520> letter to Erasmus\n[EW 302.14\u201318]).\n\nIn 1516, More\u2019s collection of epigrams was to be published with\nUtopia (CW 3.1: lxi\u2013lxii; CWE 3:\n316.89\u201390; CWE 4: 67.22\u201324; CWE 4: 281),\nbut because of printing difficulties it was instead first published\nwith the 1518 edition of Utopia; this added yet another\nelement of dialectical engagement since the epigrams contain terms and\nthemes present in the already provocative Utopia. As David\nBaker points out, for example, several of the epigrams portray the\ncharacter of the true princeps, a term used throughout\nUtopia and one which was fraught with historical and cultural\ncontroversy (33\u201345). Significantly, More uses\n\u201ccitizens\u201d and \u201cpeople\u201d rather than\n\u201csubjects\u201d in his literary works and explicitly criticizes\nkings who treat \u201csubjects\u201d as \u201cslaves\u201d (31\nOctober <1516> letter to Erasmus [EW\n278.63\u201365]).\n6. Socratic Dialogue on Philosophy and the City: Utopia\n\nUtopia, undoubtedly More\u2019s most famous and most\ncontroversial dialogue, combines elements from the dialogue forms of\nPlato and Cicero, with dozens of allusions to each author, starting\nwith the very title:\n\n\nDE OPTIMO REIPUBLICAE STATU DEQUE, nova insula UTOPIA libellus\nvere aureus nec minus salutaris quam festivus, clarissimi\ndisertissimique viri THOMAE MORI inclutae civitatis Londinensis civis\net Vicecomitis\n\n(first published in English in 1551 as On the Best State of a\nCommonwealth and on the new Island of Utopia A Truly Golden Handbook,\nNo Less Beneficial than Entertaining by the Most Distinguished and\nEloquent Author Thomas More Citizen and Undersheriff of the Famous\nCity of London).\n\n\nIt was Cicero who translated Plato\u2019s title Politeia as\nRes Publicae and who established, in his own\nRepublic and Laws, the conversation with Plato that\nMore continues in Utopia. More, however, adds comic elements\nfrom Lucian\u2019s dialogues, and to miss the humor in\nUtopia is to miss his characteristic comic irony.\n\nBook 1 of Utopia raises the large question of\nphilosophy\u2019s relation to the city. Raphael Hythloday argues that\nphilosophy will never have a place in any city unless that city\nimitates Utopia. The character \u201cThomas Morus\u201d maintains an\nopposing view: that a philosophy \u201cmore civil [civilior]\nthan Hythloday\u2019s \u201cacademic [scholasticae]\u201d\nphilosophy not only has a place, but even poses a challenge and a duty\nnot to desert \u201cthe ship in a storm because you cannot control\nthe winds\u201d\u2014while making things \u201cas little bad as you\ncan\u201d (EW 172.19\u201327). This debate goes back to\nPlato and Cicero; More continues it, but adds many issues raised by\nbiblical revelation and by Church Fathers, especially Augustine\n(Wegemer 1996: 128\u201349).\n\nBecause Hythloday does not convince Morus and his friend Peter Giles\nby the end of Book 1, Morus invites both him and Giles to lunch,\nurging Raphael to tell all he can about Utopia, especially everything\nthat it can teach about educating citizens well, so that they become\ncapable of self-rule (EW 158.82\u201383, 159.2\u20133).\nBook 2 of Utopia follows, an afternoon-long monologue by\nHythloday, who presents a highly selective description of life in\nUtopia. Afterwards, Morus observes that Hythloday is tired and not in\nthe mood to be questioned, so he invites Hythloday and Giles to\ndinner, complimenting Raphael on his story-telling and saying that\nthey will have to find another time for a deeper investigation.\nUtopia ends with Morus commenting to the reader that\n\u201cquite a few of the institutions\u201d of Utopia were\n\u201cquite absurd\u201d (EW 211.18). In a letter written a\nyear later and included at the end of the 1517 edition of\nUtopia, Morus recommended that future readers ask questions\nin order to \u201cferret \u2026 out\u201d the truth of what\nHythloday had said (EW 215.85).\n\nThe setting and many plot details of Utopia provide\nthought-provoking contrasts to both Plato\u2019s Republic\nand Cicero\u2019s. For example, Plato\u2019s Republic\nbegins as Socrates is walking (with Glaucon) away from the Piraeus (a\nport six miles from Athens), having attended the new festival for a\nforeign goddess. On his way to Athens, he is accosted by Polemarchus\nand his friends, who \u201cforce\u201d him to speak about\njustice\u2014and though promised dinner, Socrates and his\ninterlocutors by the end of their long dialogue have not yet dined.\nUtopia begins with Morus leaving a church in the middle of\nAntwerp, and this busy public official welcomes Giles and Hythloday to\nthe garden of his home where he treats them to lunch and then dinner.\nCicero\u2019s Republic, like Utopia, also takes\nplace in the garden of a busy public official\u2014Scipio\nAemilianus\u2014in the middle of Rome. Given the dramatic character\nof classical dialogues, these comparisons of settings are an important\npart of Utopia\u2019s literary and philosophic design, as\nDominic Baker-Smith has indicated (1991 [2000: 94]).\n\nThe dialectical challenge posed by the conversation between Hythloday\nand Morus is playfully but seriously seen even in the names chosen, as\nMorus himself says at EW 215.50\u201361: Utopia is\nGreek for \u201cno place\u201d, and other Greek names negate what\nthey express: the river Anyder means \u201cno water\u201d;\nthe ruler ademos means \u201cno people\u201d. This kind of\nintellectual play is also seen in Utopia\u2019s more than\n140 uses of litotes \u201cin which a thing is affirmed by stating the\nnegative of its opposite\u201d (E. McCutcheon 1971: 107). This\ndialectical game-playing is especially pointed in the oxymoron that is\nformed by Hythloday\u2019s full name: Raphael is Hebrew for\n\u201chealer from God\u201d, and Hythloday is Greek for\n\u201cspeaker of nonsense\u201d\u2014but if so, which is he really,\nand when? And since morus is Greek for \u201cfool\u201d,\nwhat are we to make of one fool talking to another?\n\nThese kinds of playful puzzles fill the Utopia, requiring the\nreader\u2019s constant attention and probing engagement in light of a\nlong and complex philosophic tradition. These competing elements are\nseen most clearly in the core debate occupying the middle of Book 2\nabout the central Utopian philosophic controversy regarding the nature\nof virtue. Utopia\u2019s philosophic position is a strange mixture of\nan Epicurean emphasis on pleasure and the Stoic definition of virtue,\nwhile alluding throughout to Cicero\u2019s criticisms of both\npositions as well as to elements characteristic of\nChristianity\u2019s distinctive perspectives.\n\nAlthough the scholarship on Utopia far surpasses any other of\nMore\u2019s works, no consensus has emerged regarding the intricate\nintellectual puzzle More has created.\n7. \u201cTrue dialectic and true philosophy, especially Aristotelian\u201d\n\nIn his 1515 controversy with Martin Dorp and the scholastic\ntheologians at the University of Louvain, More defended \u201ctrue\ndialectic and true philosophy, especially Aristotelian\u201d (21\nOctober <1515> letter to Dorp [EW 395.73\u201374]). In\n1518 he again publicly defended philosophy, specifically Greek\nphilosophy, in the curriculum at Oxford University (29 March\n<1518> letter to Oxford University [EW\n419.59\u201362]). Around 1518, More also included philosophy in the\ncurriculum for his children (<1518> letter to Gonell\n[EW 289.6]), and his daughters went on to dispute philosophy\nbefore Henry VIII in 1526 (<1526> letter from John Palsgrave\n[Corr 405.76\u201377]). His daughter Margaret devoted\nherself \u201cdiligently to philosophy\u201d, a course of studies\nthat More encouraged along with \u201cmedical science and sacred\nliterature\u201d but without neglecting \u201chumane letters and\nso-called liberal studies\u201d because in these latter studies in\nparticular \u201ca good judgment is formed or perfected\u201d\n(<1521> letter to Margaret Roper [EW\n314.50\u201380]).\n\nIn the letter to his children\u2019s tutor William Gonell (c. 1518),\nMore pointed out that the \u201cmost learned\u201d of the\nphilosophers serve usefully as \u201cguides of human life\u201d\n(EW 289.4\u20136), and that wisdom is an important objective\nof education, depending, as he believed, \u201con the inner knowledge\nof what is right [recti conscientia]\u201d\u2014or, in a\nmore accurate translation, \u201con a right conscience\u201d\n(EW 288.75\u201377). Another major objective of education is\nan inward \u201ccalm and \u2026 peace\u201d allowing a person to\nbe\n\n\nneither stirred by praise of flatterers nor stung by the follies of\nunlearned mockers of learning [neque ridentium literas\nilliteratorum mordeantur ineptiis]. (EW\n289.78\u201383)\n\n\nTowards these ends, More gave a special place to the classical authors\nbut also to the Bible and the Church Fathers (EW\n290.65\u201377).\n\nLater, More would again emphasize the special importance that should\nbe given to Greek writings\u2014classical, biblical, and patristic\n(<1518> letter to Oxford [EW 419\u201320]\u2014while\nalso recognizing the important contributions of Cicero, Seneca, the\nLatin Church Fathers (EW 419.13\u201314, 60), as well as\nThomas Aquinas, \u201cthat most learned and also most holy man\u201d\n(Response to Luther, Book 1 [CW 5: 355.23\u20134]),\n\u201cthe very flower of theology, and a man of that true perfect\nfaith and Christian living\u201d (The Confutation of\nTyndale\u2019s Answer [CW 8: 713.21, 14]).\n8. Free Speech, Conscience, and Dialectical Inquiry\n\nIn 1523 as Speaker of the House of Commons, More delivered an oration\nrequesting freedom of speech in the House of Commons (c. 1556\nRoper\u2019s Life of More [EW 1387.80\u201386,\n1393\u201394]). He argued that though the king and his prudent\nadvisors had, with \u201cdue diligence\u201d, called upon \u201cthe\nmost discreet persons out of every quarter\u201d to give \u201cright\nsubstantial counsel\u201d, yet since a person\u2019s \u201cmind is\noften so occupied with the matter\u201d being discussed, it might\nhappen that the person \u201crather studieth what to say\nthan how\u201d to say it\u2014or another person might be\n\u201cso fervent in a matter\u201d that he might \u201cspeak in\nsuch a wise as he would afterward wish to have uttered\notherwise\u201d. So, to be\n\n\nutterly discharged of all doubt and fear how anything that it should\nhappen them to speak, should happen of your Highness to be taken,\n\n\nMore requested that\n\n\nour most benign and godly King \u2026 give to all your Commons here\nassembled your most gracious licence and pardon, freely, without doubt\nof your dreadful displeasure, every man to discharge his conscience,\nand boldly in everything incident among us to declare his advice.\n(EW 1394.19\u201371)\n\n\nHere, and consistently throughout his writings, this\n\u201cdischarge\u201d of one\u2019s conscience was ordered\n\u201cto declar[ing] \u2026 the very truth\u201d as one saw it\nafter \u201cthe matter [had been] thoroughly debated \u2026 using\ndiligence and troth\u201d (1 February 1533/4 letter to Thomas\nCromwell [EW 376.12, 62]; The Debellation of Salem and\nBizance [CW 10: 162.14\u201315, 26]; also c. 1513\nHistory of King Richard III [EW 125.65], 1533\nAnswer to a Poisoned Book [EW 918.40\u201343],\n<August 1534> letter of Margaret Roper to Alice Alington\n[EW 1318.52], 1535 Paris Newsletter [EW\n1385.10 and 25], 1548 Hall\u2019s Chronical [EW\n1389.50]; see esp. More\u2019s two 1534 letters to Wilson\n[EW 1320\u201323]).\n\nMore\u2019s case for free deliberation \u201cusing diligence and\ntroth\u201d\u2014i.e., for genuine dialectical inquiry\u2014in\nParliament and legal matters was similar to the case he made for\ndeliberating political and theological matters. For example,\n\u201cEpigram 198: What Is the Best Form of Government?\u201d opens\nas a debate regarding which is better, a hereditary monarchy or a\nsenate. After giving arguments on both sides and after presenting the\nchoice as between one person who by \u201cblind chance\u201d is\n\u201cruler of his advisers\u201d and a group of persons\n\u201celected by the people to rule\u201d by \u201creasonable\nagreement [certum consilium]\u201d (EW 249), the\npoem\u2019s narrator abruptly ends the debate, leaving the reader to\nponder the issue.\n\nThis concern for genuine dialectical inquiry free from self-interest\nwas expressed by More most dramatically to Henry VIII after the king\nfirst asked his support in 1527 for his divorce from Queen Catherine.\nMore studied all the materials he was given, discussing them with the\nadvisors Henry identified. After doing so, he suggested to Henry that\nMore himself and Henry\u2019s other advisors might not give the king\nthe best advice because \u201cbeing all your Grace\u2019s own\nservants\u201d and because of \u201cyour manifold benefits daily\nbestowed on us\u201d, they could be \u201cinclined to deceive\nyou\u201d. Therefore, More advised Henry to consult the counselors\nmost fit to help \u201cunderstand the truth\u201d of his case:\n\u201cSaint Jerome, Saint Augustine, and diverse other old holy\ndoctors, both Greeks and Latins\u201d (Roper\u2019s Life of\nMore [EW 1399]). One of More\u2019s objectives as a\nyoung man in studying Greek had been to read the Greek Church Fathers,\nand throughout his life, he studied both the Latin and Greek\n\u201cold holy doctors and fathers\u201d to determine the\n\u201cconsent of the common Catholic Church\u201d regarding\ncontested matters (7 December <1532> letter against John Frith\n[EW 361.59, 368.36], 1529 Dialogue of Sir Thomas More,\nKnight [EW 607.28\u201355]). Even at his trial, More\nemphasized the importance of international councils to study matters,\naware of the influence exerted by national or historical interests. At\nhis trial, for example, he said:\n\n\nFor one bishop who agrees with you, I have easily a hundred, including\nsome who are among the saints. And for your one council, Parliament,\nand your statute\u2014what it is worth the great good God\nknows\u2014on my side are all the general councils celebrated during\nthe last thousand years. (1535 Guildhall Report 10 [EW\n1361])\n\n\nAt that trial, he went on to argue that England\u2019s unilateral\naction was \u201ccontrary to the unity and concord\u201d of\n\u201cthe whole Christian world\u201d (EW 1361.47\u201350,\nGuildhall Report 12)\u2014a determination More made after his\n\u201cstudy during the whole of the last seven years\u201d; he\nfinally made public this determination (after years of silence)\n\u201cfor the exoneration of my conscience\u201d (1535 Guildhall\nReport 8 [EW 1361.16\u201319]).\n9. Judgments \u201cin conscience\u201d\n\n\u201cRight conscience\u201d, for More, is a judgment of the\npractical intellect about some particular matter, in light of\nprinciples discovered to be true\u2014and if doubt arose about a\nfundamental principle, he held it to be the duty of a properly\nconvened international General Counsel to clarify the principle\ninvolved, judged in light of the entire received tradition (<August\n1534> letter of Margaret Roper to Alice Alington [EW\n1316\u201317]). More explained this to his daughter Margaret when she\ncame for the third time to convince her father to leave prison and to\nsign the oath, as she and their friends had all done. More pointed out\nthe danger of \u201cframing oneself a conscience\u201d to gratify\none\u2019s desire rather than to determine what is true. Accused of\nbeing a \u201cfoolish scrupulous ass\u201d, More told one of his\nmost famous \u201cmerry tales\u201d about \u201ca poor honest man\nof the country that was called Company\u201d who refused to perjure\nhimself as a jury member. When pressed to go along with the others,\nCompany says:\n\n\n[N]ow when we shall hence and come before God, and that he shall send\nyou to heaven for doing according to your conscience, and me to the\ndevil for doing against mine, \u2026 if I shall then say to all you\nagain, \u2018Masters, I went once for good company with you, which is\nthe cause that I go now to hell, play you the good fellows now again\nwith me; as I went then for good company with you, so some of you now\nfor good company with me. (EW 1314\u201315)\n\n\n\u201cConscience\u201d became a word More used with great frequency\ntowards the end of his life. But even in his earliest education\nletter, he twice identified a \u201cright conscience [recti\nconscientia]\u201d as one of the main goals of education\n(<1518> letter to Gonell [EW 288.76\u201377, 289.80]),\nand, in his earliest poetry, as we have seen, he wrote that: \u201cOf\nvirtue more joy the conscience hath within / Than outward the body of\nall his filthy sin\u201d (c. 1510 Life of Pico [EW\n87.139\u201341]), and that there is \u201cno pleasure comparable\n\u2026 / To th\u2019inward gladness of a virtuous mind\u201d (c.\n1510 Life of Pico [EW 89.74\u201375]). He expressed\nthis same thought in prison, writing that \u201cthe clearness of my\nconscience hath made my heart hop for joy\u201d, knowing that he had\nsearched for seven years and was \u201cvery sure \u2026 in refusing\nto swear against mine own conscience\u201d (1534 letter to Margaret\nRoper [EW 1324.68\u201369]).\n\nJudgments made \u201cin conscience\u201d were so central to More\nthat he discussed this issue with Henry VIII before agreeing to enter\nthe king\u2019s service in 1518; he had a similar conversation\nregarding his service as Lord Chancellor of England in 1529. Both\ntimes, More reported, Henry gave the \u201cmost virtuous lesson that\never prince taught his servant\u201d:\n\n\nthat I should perceive mine own conscience should serve me, and that I\nshould first look unto God and after God unto him. (5 March\n<1534> letter to Thomas Cromwell [EW 384.70\u201375],\n1534 letter to Wilson [EW 1321.35\u201341], <3 June\n1535> letter to Margaret Roper [EW 1332.67\u201373])\n\n10. Polemical Works: Status of Reason, Liberty, Law\n\nAs Stephen Greenblatt indicated in his influential 1980 study of\nRenaissance self-fashioning, the \u201cprinciple of\nintelligibility\u201d is a major topic in More studies (63;\n24\u201325, 59). More posed serious epistemological issues in\nquestioning how we know\u2014early on, for example, he questioned how\nLuther knows what he knows. In his first polemical work,\n\u201crequest[ed] by the king and court\u201d (1523 Response to\nLuther [CW 5: 791]), More created the persona of an\neasily-angered, common-sense English lawyer who questions Luther in\nthe following way.\n\n\n\u2026 [W]e ask of him: \u201cBy what reason, Father, do you prove\nthat you alone must be believed?\u201d\n\nTo this he returns this cause: \u201cBecause I am certain\u201d, he\nsays, \u201cthat I have my teachings from heaven\u201d.\n\nAgain we ask: \u201cBy what reason are you certain that you have your\nteachings from heaven?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause God has seized me unawares\u201d, he says, \u201cand\ncarried me into the midst of these turmoils\u201d.\n\nAgain therefore we demand: \u201cHow do you know that God has seized\nyou?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I am certain\u201d, he says, \u201cthat my teaching\nis from God\u201d.\n\n\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause God has seized me\u201d.\n\n\u201cHow do you know this?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I am certain\u201d.\n\n\u201cHow are you certain?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I know\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut how do you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I am certain\u201d.\n\nI ask you, reader, whether that form of disputing does not find a\nplace here\u2026. (1523 Response to Luther [EW\n517.31\u201353])\n\n\nHere in this 1523 text, as he would do later in all of his polemical\nworks, More regularly addresses his readers and asks them to judge for\nthemselves\u2014in light of reason and in light of an international\nagreement achieved through 1500 years of conciliar and scholarly\ndeliberation.\n\nMore also addressed directly Luther\u2019s early claims that\n\u201creason hindereth us in our faith, and is unto faith an\nenemy\u201d (1529 Dialogue of Sir Thomas More, Knight\n[EW 698.23\u201324]) and that a spiritual elect had\nindependence from all governors and from all civil and ecclesiastical\nlaws (1523 Response to Luther [EW 510\u201311,\n522\u201323], 1529 Dialogue [EW 698\u201399]).\nMore saw these claims as undermining what he, Erasmus, and others saw\nas the path to lasting reform of both church and state: improved\neducation resulting in better laws. More pointed out the danger of\ndenying free will and teaching that it is \u201cvain\u201d to resist\n\u201csinful appetites\u201d (1529 Dialogue [EW\n703.42])\u2014advice that countered the view of virtue that both the\nclassical and the biblical traditions shared. If human beings are not\nresponsible for their actions, then Luther\u2019s \u201cliberty of\nthe gospel\u201d is, for More, \u201cunbridled license\u201d\n(Response to Luther, Book 1 [CW 5: 271.4\u20135])\nand a sure path to lawlessness and violence (Response to Luther,\nBook 2 [CW 5: 689\u201391]).\n\nFor More, law was itself the product of collective reason over time.\nHe gives one of his clearest explanations of law after quoting a long\ndefense of law by Henry VIII, who invoked Scripture, the Church\nFathers, and history to prove that \u201cthe people without law\ndrifts to and fro like a ship without a rudder\u201d (1523\nResponse to Luther [EW 508\u20139], quoting\nHenry\u2019s Defense of the Seven Sacraments). More then\ncompares the biblical law against stealing with human laws about\nprivate property. If no one owned anything, there would be no theft,\nhe observed. But \u201creason alone prescribe[s] the forms of\ndetermining property\u201d together with \u201can agreement, and\nthis a public agreement \u2026 taking root in usage or expressed in\nwriting [which] is public law\u201d (EW 510.39\u201344).\nLuther\u2019s undermining the status of law\u2014biblical and\ncivic\u2014is, More insists,\n\n\nin opposition to the judgment of all learned men, in opposition to the\njudgment of all good men, in opposition to the public agreement of the\nwhole world. (EW 511.15\u201318)\n\n\nYet realist that he was, More cites Plutarch, \u201cthe great moral\nphilosopher\u201d (EW 501.23), in recognizing that laws\ncan\n\n\nbe much like \u2026 cobwebs, in which the little gnats and flies\nstick still and hang fast, but the great [bumble]-bees break them and\nfly quite through. (1534 Dialogue of Comfort [EW\n1209.41\u201344]; see Plutarch, Life of Solon 5)\n\n\nIn his second major polemical work, published in 1529 in response to\nthe bishop of London\u2019s request (7 March 1527/8 letter from\nBishop Tunstall [EW 351]), More countered Luther\u2019s and\nTyndale\u2019s criticisms of philosophy and the role of reason by\narguing that reason plays an essential role, but it must be a\nwell-trained reason within a well-tempered body and soul (1534\nDialogue of Comfort [EW 1238.34], 1535 Sadness\nof Christ [EW 1260.31ff]). Without a proper order or\n\u201cgood temper\u201d of the soul, More maintained that reason\n\u201cwill not fail to fall in rebellion\u201d. Elsewhere he\nregularly used the classical image of training the powerful horses of\nthe soul with bridle and bit if they are ever to be happy and\nserviceable (EW 15.271, 26.15\u201336, 577.1\u20132,\n580.83, 581.54, 584.69\u201371, 1101.56, 1232.71\u201372,\n1350.46\u201347). The bodily appetites must be tempered so that the\nspiritual appetites can flourish (EW 1242\u201343).\n\nArguing further for the essential role of reason, More goes on to show\nits role in the interpretation of Scripture:\n\n\n\u201cNow, in the study of Scripture\u2014in devising upon the\nsentence, in considering what ye read, in pondering the purpose of\ndiverse comments, in comparing together diverse texts that seem\ncontrary and be not\u2014albeit I deny not but that grace and\nGod\u2019s especial help is the great thing therein, yet useth he for\nan instrument man\u2019s reason thereto. God helpeth us to eat, also,\nbut yet not without our mouth. Now as the hand is the more nimble by\nthe use of some feats, and the legs and feet more swift and sure by\ncustom of going and running, and the whole body the more wieldy and\nlusty by some kind of exercise, so is it no doubt but that reason is\nby study, labor, and exercise of logic, philosophy, and other liberal\narts, corroborated and quickened, and the judgment\u2014both in them\nand also in orators, laws, and stories\u2014much riped. And albeit\npoets be with many men taken but for painted words, yet do they much\nhelp the judgment, and make a man, among other things, well furnished\nof one special thing, without which all learning is half\nlame.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d quoth he.\n\n\u201cMarry\u201d, quoth I, \u201ca good mother wit. And therefore\nare, in mine opinion, these Lutherans in a mad mind, that would now\nhave all learning save Scripture only clean cast away, which things\n(if the time will serve) be as methinketh to be taken and had, and\nwith reason brought, as I said before, into the service of\ndivinity\u201d. (1529 Dialogue [EW\n581.4\u201333])\n\n\nAs shown in this passage, More considered a mind that does not\nrecognize the necessary role of a well-trained reason in human life to\nbe mad.\n\nHe was consistent throughout his life in presenting the\ncomplementarity of reason and revelation:\n\n\n[R]eason hath no full and perfect instruction without help of\nrevelation. For not only in things only to be believed, but in many\nthings also that are to be done [or] left undone, for anything that\nreason can tell either them or us, we be fain [i.e., glad] to seek the\ncertainty of revelation. (The Confutation of Tyndale\u2019s\nAnswer [CW 8: 996.3\u20138])\n\n\nAs the More scholar Joanne Paul has argued, the problem as More saw it\nwas that Luther removes \u201cthe authority of judging doctrines from\nthe people and delivers it to anyone whatever\u201d, that is,\n\u201cfrom the people, as a corporate whole, to single\nindividuals\u201d. This is\n\n\nespecially problematic in that it encourages pride in others, telling\nthem that they too have the power to interpret scripture according to\ntheir own judgement\u2026. As More says, now \u201cevery prattling\nfool, every smatterer in scripture, shall be judge over all the\ngeneral councils, and over the whole corps of Christendom, to tell\nthem all that himself understandeth the scripture better than they\nall\u201d. (98\u201399; see also Guy 2017: 41; Duffy 2017:\n36\u201337)\n\n\nIn his longest polemical work, More satirizes what Tyndale calls his\n\u201cfeeling faith\u201d by contrasting it with the consent and\nagreement achieved by international \u201csynods and counsels\u201d\nthat \u201crepresent the whole Church\u201d (Confutation\n[CW 8: 146, 8, 16]). Over 170 times More shows how the\n\u201cfeeling faith\u201d of\n\n\nLuther, Tyndale, and Zwingli, \u2026 and his fellows, goes against\nthe interpretation of all holy doctors and saints, and the common\nfaith of all true Christian people, fifteen hundred years before them.\n(CW 8: 157.11\u201314)\n\n\nHere More continues to use his favorite technique of irony in a manner\nreminiscent of his calling the murderous Richard the\n\u201cProtector\u201d almost 100 times in his History of King\nRichard III.\n11. \u201cReason ought to reign like a king\u201d\n\nHow can reason pilot a soul suffering the greatest of interior storms\nwhile being attacked by the most terrifying external forces? How can a\ncharioteer guide powerful horses spooked by fear? More, in broken\nhealth, addressed these questions (<August 1534> letter of\nMargaret Roper to Alice Alington [EW 1311.17\u201320]), in\nthe last years of his life, even as he himself faced the prospect of\ntorture (16 January 1534/5 letter to Master Leder [EW\n1329.20\u201321]) as well as the most painful and shameful death that\nEngland had devised (1535 Bag of Secrets [EW\n1360.76\u201386]). Prior to his imprisonment, when counting the\ncosts, More confessed to being scandalized by his own resistance to\nsuffering (1534 letter 210 to Margaret Roper [EW\n1325.59\u201362]), yet he also confessed that despite \u201csuch\nfear and heavy pensiveness \u2026 I never in my mind intended to\nconsent\u201d to do anything that would go against \u201cmine own\nconscience\u201d (1534 letter 211 to Margaret Roper [EW\n1327.77\u201381]). But he saw close friends\u2014under fears and\npressures similar to those he faced\u2014consent to what earlier they\nhad strongly rejected in conscience (August 1534 letter of Margaret\nRoper to Alice Alington [EW 1311\u201320], 1534 letters to\nWilson [EW 1320\u201323]).\n\nAgainst this background, More wrote his last Socratic dialogue, A\nDialogue of Comfort against Tribulation (1534). It focuses on the\nrole of reason in preparing the soul to be guided in a time of great\ntrial by a reason enlightened by faith and strengthened by grace. As\nMore explained later in his final work, The Sadness of\nChrist, \u201cin a human being, reason ought to reign like a\nking\u201d (1535 [EW 1289.30]). But if this ought to be the\ncase, why does it rarely turn out that way? Even Christ\u2019s human\nnature rebelled to the point that he sweated blood and pleaded that\nthe cup of suffering might pass; even angels and the first human\nbeings with all of their special gifts failed (EW\n1027\u201337). In response to this challenge, More argued that human\nbeings are created to be responsible for learning how to govern freely\ntheir own God-given faculties of memory, intellect, and will\u2014and\nhe warned that they will fail \u201call for \u2026\nnegligence\u201d in using their freedom properly (EW\n1035.75, 87.141; 1153.62; 1182.26; 1259.79\u201382, 1260.23,\n1273.64).\n\nIn A Dialogue of Comfort, terrified young Vincent comes\nseeking advice from wise old Antony. Vincent is obsessed with fears\nfor himself, his family, and his country as the Turks prepare to\nreturn to Hungary after having killed and tortured many Hungarians\njust one year before.\n\nVincent is so distraught that it takes Antony two and a half books to\ncalm him down enough to address the first and most important of his\nconcerns. In those books, Antony exhibits a skillful Socratic\nstrategy, leading Vincent to sufficient self-knowledge so that he can\nbegin the work of self-government. Antony confirms, for example, that\nessential seeds are planted in the garden of Vincent\u2019s soul\n(EW 1116.5, 9; 1232.59\u201363; also EW 4.120,\n479.53\u201369) and reveals to him those seeds that are missing or\ninsufficiently cultivated (EW 1126.48ff, 1185.39\u201342,\n1237.49\u201386). Antony even has Vincent play the part of a rich man\nas a way of leading him to deeper self-knowledge (EW\n1211\u201314), since a thorough knowledge of self is foundational to\nenable the active cultivation of his own soul that Vincent will\npromise to undertake at the end of this Dialogue.\n\nAfter two and a half books of conversation, Antony judges that Vincent\nhas achieved sufficient \u201ccomfort and courage\u201d that he can\nnow help Vincent \u201cmore quietly consider\u201d the \u201csorest\npart\u201d of his fears, the fears he brought up early in Book 1\n(EW 1219.64\u201371). Antony deliberately postponed this\nconsideration (EW 1125.57) until Vincent\u2019s soul was\nsufficiently calm, recognizing that it is not possible to\n\u201cexamine the weight and substance\u201d of his greatest terrors\n\u201cwhen the heart is \u2026 taken up and oppressed with the\ntroublous affection of heavy sorrowful fear\u201d (EW\n1219.67\u201371). For reason to reign, the soul must have a certain\nlevel of equanimity\u2014an insight reinforced in More by Lucian and\nSeneca among others (EW 20.16n2 1164.42\u201343, 1219.66,\n1224.25, 1380.45\u201350; EW 1221.30 for Seneca), and by his\nown experience.\n\nWhat More does in A Dialogue of Comfort is to show how\ndifficult it is to achieve enough self-knowledge to begin the training\nneeded for self-government, because true self-government requires\nunderstanding reason\u2019s essential but insufficient\nrole\u2014hence the dialogue\u2019s insistence on the need for\nGod\u2019s grace and revelation. Antony explains that, created with\nreason and free will, every human being is obliged to undertake this\nmost important and most difficult project of self-government\n(EW 1255.29\u201331).\n\nVincent began Book 1 with images of tempestuous storms, cruel torture,\nand tyrannical oppression\u2014images that obsessed and deeply\ndisturbed his soul and the souls of his friends (EW 1112.36,\n50\u201351, 56\u201357; EW 1112.53, 70\u20137;\n1113.3\u20137, 21\u20132). Appropriately then, Antony repeatedly\nuses the images of sailing in storms or of riding spirited and\npowerful horses. Part of sailing is knowing when and how to lower the\nsails in a storm (EW 1123.7\u20139) and training oneself to\ndeal with fear in the face of losing the ship when it is buffeted by\nwinds (EW 1135.60\u20133, 1163.70\u201379,\n1175.6\u201312). Part of guiding powerful horses is learning how to\nuse bridle and bit (EW 1232.71\u20134), just as one learns\nto discipline the temperament of one\u2019s own soul (EW\n1168.24\u201330, 1175.71\u20131176.13).\n\nUltimately Antony helps Vincent see and appreciate the indispensable\nroles played by reason in tempering the soul by coming to learn and\nmaintain those habits necessary for reason to rule. But self-knowledge\nalso reveals the limits of fallible reason and therefore the need for\nit to be supported by prayer and grace\u2014a topic treated again in\nMore\u2019s final book, The Sadness and Weariness and Fear and\nPrayer of Christ.\n\nVincent (whose name means \u201che who conquers\u201d) ends A\nDialogue of Comfort by resolving to transform his affections from\nlove of earthly goods to spiritual goods. To do so, he not only writes\ndown Antony\u2019s counsels in Hungarian but also translates them\ninto multiple languages to imprint them in his mind and imagination,\nworking to fulfill Antony\u2019s requirement of \u201csufficient\nminding\u201d (EW 1241.60).\n\nMore was imprisoned for the last sixteen months of his life and was\nexecuted for high treason on 6 July 1535. His last works and days put\nto the test his earlier theory of philosophy as a preparation for\ndeath. How theory and practice aligned in his life and thought is part\nof the intrigue of studying this Renaissance figure whom Erasmus\ndescribed as a \u201cman for all seasons\u201d.\n",
