    "main_text": "Experience and Metaphysics || The Development of \u201cMetaphysics\u201d\n3.5 The Development of \u201cMetaphysics\u201d\n\nDebate over a definite meaning for the term \u201cmetaphysics\u201d,\nwas just as alive in Dewey\u2019s day as in ours. From the beginning,\nDewey sought to critique and reconstruct metaphysical concepts (e.g.,\nreality, self, consciousness, time, necessity, and individuality) and\nsystems (e.g., Spinoza, Leibniz, Kant, and Hegel). Like his fellow\npragmatists Peirce, James, and Mead, Dewey sought to transform not\neradicate metaphysics. As described earlier, Dewey\u2019s early\nmetaphysical views were closest to idealism, but engagements with\nexperimental science and instrumentalism convinced him to abandon\ntraditional metaphysics\u2019 project of giving an ultimate and\ncomplete account of reality \u00fcberhaupt.\n\nHis dormant interest in metaphysics was revivified at Columbia by his\ncolleague F. J. E. Woodbridge, who illustrated how metaphysics might\nbe done in a \u201cdescriptive\u201d rather than an extra-physical\nway (\u201cBiography of John Dewey\u201d, in Schilpp 1939: 36).\nWhile many of Dewey\u2019s most important writings on metaphysics\nwere also about experience (discussed above), special attention should\nbe paid to \u201cThe Postulate of Immediate Empiricism\u201d (1905,\nPIE, MW3), \u201cThe Subject-Matter of Metaphysical\nInquiry\u201d (1915, MW8), and his \u201cIntroduction\u201d to\nEssays in Experimental Logic (1916c, MW10)\u2014all vital\nsteps toward his magnum opus, Experience and\n Nature.[15]\nEN\u2019s final chapters, dealing with art and consummatory\nexperience, are developed in Art as Experience (1934b, LW10),\nanother source of significant metaphysical discussions.\n\nWhile labels tend to obscure Dewey\u2019s innovations, it is safe say\nthat Dewey had a realist, naturalistic, non-reductive, emergentist,\nprocess\n metaphysics.[16]\n He sought to describe the most general features (\u201cgeneric\ntraits\u201d) of nature in a way which did empirical justice to the\nworld as encountered, and which could be useful toward future attempts\nto describe and change the world for the better. Unlike other\nmetaphysics, Dewey explicitly said that metaphysics served something\nfurther\u2014criticism. In the end, Dewey wound up\ndescribing his efforts both as a \u201cmetaphysics\u201d and as a\n\u201csystem\u201d, that is, \u201cthe hanging together of various\nproblems and various hypotheses in a perspective\u201d (\u201cNature\nin Experience\u201d, LW14: 141\u2013142). He described his\nenterprise as both informed by \u201ca definite point of view\u201d\nand by the contemporary, human world (\u201cHalf-hearted\nNaturalism\u201d, LW3: 75\u201376 ).\n",
