    "main_text": "The Status of Instrumental Rationality\n4. The Status of Instrumental Rationality\n\nMuch discussion of instrumental rationality has taken place in the\ncontext of a debate about whether instrumental rationality is the only\nkind of practical rationality or, alternatively, there are other\nrequirements of practical rationality as well, such as requirements of\nprudence and morality. Typically, the former view is called a\n\u201cHumean\u201d one and the latter a \u201cKantian\u201d one.\nIn this section, we\u2019ll consider some possible understandings of\nthe thesis that instrumental rationality is the only kind of practical\nrationality\n (\u00a74.1),\n and whether some version of this thesis is given any support by an\ninstrumental analogue of Lewis Carroll\u2019s famous paradox\nconcerning modus ponens\n (\u00a74.2).\n We\u2019ll also consider the views of Hume\n (\u00a74.3)\n and Kant\n (\u00a74.4)\n on instrumental rationality.\n",
