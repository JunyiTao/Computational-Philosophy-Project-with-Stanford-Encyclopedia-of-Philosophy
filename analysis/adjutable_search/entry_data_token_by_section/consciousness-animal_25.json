    "main_text": "Special Topics in the Study of Animal Consciousness || Self-consciousness and metacognition\n7.5 Self-consciousness and metacognition\n\n\nSystematic study of self-consciousness and theory of mind in nonhuman\nanimals has roots in an approach to the study of self-consciousness\npioneered by Gallup (1970).  Gallup\u2019s rationale for linking\nmirror-self recognition to self-awareness has already been discussed\nabove.  The idea for the experiment came from observations well-known\nto comparative psychologists that chimpanzees would, after a period of\nadjustment, use mirrors to inspect their own images.  Gallup used\nthese observations to develop a widely-replicated protocol that\nappears to allow a scientific determination of whether it is merely\nthe mirror image per se that is the object of interest to the\nanimal inspecting it, or whether it is the image qua proxy for the\nanimal itself that is the object of interest. Taking chimpanzees who\nhad extensive prior familiarity with mirrors, Gallup anesthetized his\nsubjects and marked their foreheads with a distinctive dye, or, in a\ncontrol group, anesthetized them only. Upon waking, marked animals who\nwere allowed to see themselves in a mirror touched their own foreheads\nin the region of the mark significantly more frequently than controls\nwho were either unmarked or not allowed to look into a mirror.\n Although it is typically reported that chimpanzees consistently\n\u201cpass\u201d the mirror-mark test, a survey of the scientific\nliterature by Shumaker & Swartz (2002) indicates that of 163\nchimpanzees tested, only 73 showed mark-touching behavior (although\nthere was considerable variation in the age and mirror experience\namong these animals). Shumaker & Swartz also report mark-touching\nbehavior in 5 of 6 tested orang utans and 6 of 23 gorillas. They\nsuggest that the lower incidence of mark touching by gorillas may be\ndue to avoidance of socially-significant direct eye contact.\n\nFor non-human primates outside the great apes, the evidence for mirror\nself-recognition has been sparse.  Gallup himself regards it as a\nphenomenon restricted to the great apes only, and he was among the\nfirst to challenge Hauser\u2019s report that cotton top tamarins engaged in\nmirror-guided self-directed behaviors after their distinctive white\ntufts had been dyed neon colors, a stimulus that Hauser and coauthors\nargued was presumably more salient than the red dot used by Gallup\n(Hauser et al. 1995).  Faced with Gallup\u2019s challenge, Hauser\nhimself was unable to replicate his initial results (Hauser et\nal. 2001).  However, the idea that Gallup\u2019s protocol uses a\nstimulus that is not particularly salient to monkeys continues to have\nsome currency. For example, Rajala et al. (2010) have\npresented quantitative and videographic evidence that rhesus monkeys\nwith surgical implants in their heads use mirrors to inspect the\nimplants, as well as other parts of their bodies that they cannot\nusually see.\n\n\nModified versions of Gallup\u2019s experiment have also been conducted with\nnon-primate species. Notoriously, Epstein et al. (1981)\ntrained pigeons to peck at a mark on their own bodies that was visible\nonly in a mirror, and they used this to call into question the\nattribution of \u201cself-awareness\u201d on the basis of the\nmirror-mark test, preferring an associative learning\nexplanation. Gallup et al. (2002) reject the claimed\nequivalence, pointing out that chimpanzees were not trained to touch\nmarks before the test was administered. Reiss & Marino (2001) have\noffered evidence of mirror self-recognition in bottlenose\ndolphins. Using a modified version of Gallup\u2019s procedure that involved\nno anesthesia, they inferred self-recognition from bodily contortions\nin front of the mirror (self-touching being anatomically impossible\nfor dolphins). This evidence has been disputed (e.g. Wynne 2004). The\nmirror-mark test continues to be an area of active investigation in\nvarious species including elephants (Plotnik et al. 2006) and\nmagpies (Prior et al. 2008).  Various commentators have\npointed out that the mirror test may not be entirely fair for species\nwhich depend more heavily on senses other than vision (Mitchell 2002;\nBekoff and Burghardt 2002). \nAn intriguing line of research into animals\u2019 knowledge of their own\nmental states considers the performance of animals in situations of\ncognitive uncertainty.  When primates and dolphins are given a\n\u201cbailout\u201d response allowing them to avoid making difficult\ndiscriminations, they have been shown to choose the bailout option in\nways that are very similar to humans (Smith et al. 2003). The\nfact that animals who have no bailout option and are thus forced to\nrespond to the difficult comparisons do worse than those who have the\nbailout option but choose to respond to the test has been used to\nargue for some kind of higher-order self understanding. The original\nexperiments have attracted both philosophical criticism of the\nsecond-order interpretation (e.g. Carruthers 2008) and methodological\ncriticism by psychologists (reviewed by Crystal & Foote 2009),\nalthough alternative approaches to establishing metacognition in\nnon-linguistic animals may be capable of avoiding these criticisms\n(Terrace & Son 2009).\nIn the literature on human cognition, awareness of what one knows\nis called \u201cmetacognition\u201d and it is associated with a\n\u201cfeeling of knowing\u201d.  Smith and colleagues claim that\ninvestigating metacognition in animals could provide information about\nthe relation of self-awareness to other-awareness (theory of mind),\nand that their results already show that \u201canimals have\nfunctional features of or parallels to human conscious\ncognition\u201d (Smith et al. 2003; Smith 2009).  They also\nraise the question of what this might tell us about the phenomenal\nfeatures of that cognition.  Browne (2004) argues that the dolphin\nresearch cannot support the connection to theory of mind, but that it\nnevertheless is relevant to consciousness in dolphins, particularly\nwithin the theoretical framework provided by Lycan, described\nabove. The notion of metacognition also seems relevant to questions\nabout access consciousness.
