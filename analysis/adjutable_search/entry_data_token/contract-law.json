General Theories of the Law of Contracts\n\nThis first part examines general theories of contract that take\ncentral features of the common law as their explanatory starting\npoint. The range of possible contract law regimes is, of course, vast,\nand there is a risk of overgeneralization. Still, since many\nexchange-regimes share basic features, it is not an unreasonable\nexpectation that the principles extracted from a sophisticated and\nwell-functioning body of contract law might aid in our understanding\nof contract law as such, at least where the law functions to regulate\neconomic life in modern market orders.\n\nThere are at least five prominent accounts of the fundamental\nprinciples of the common law of contracts. The first, and most famous,\nholds that contract law enforces the basic moral duty to keep\npromises. A related though distinct view presents contract law as\nenforcing a duty not to harm others. A third conceives of the law not\nas enforcing parties\u2019 non-legal duties, but as promoting\nefficient investment and exchange. An association with economic theory\ngives this approach a prominence in legal scholarship that outstrips\nthe philosophical attention it has received. A fourth position\nemphasizes that contracts establish a distinctive relationship between\nthe parties to them and grounds contractual obligations in the value\nof acting jointly and cooperatively with others. A fifth position is\npluralistic and proposes that contract law has many fundamental goals\nthat need not be jointly satisfiable or even consistent. These\ncompeting views can be evaluated along several dimensions, including\n\u201cfit\u201d with actual doctrine, success in justifying the law,\nand internal coherence.\n1.1 Bare promissory duties\n\nThe law of contracts prominently employs the language of\npromise-making and promissory obligation. The Restatement (Second) of\nContracts [henceforth: \u201cR2\u201d] defines a contract as\n\n\na promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a\nremedy, or the performance of which the law in some way recognizes as\na duty. (\u00a71)\n\n\nContracting parties are regularly referred to as\n\u201cpromisor\u201d and \u201cpromisee\u201d. Where there are\nmultiple parties to a contract, the Restatement provides that\n\u201csome or all of them may promise jointly as a unit, or some or\nall of them may each promise severally\u201d. Although the\nRestatement does not state what a promise is, it defines offer and\nacceptance, the pair of acts through which contractual obligations\ncharacteristically arise, in terms that involve an exchange of\npromises. An \u201coffer\u201d is\n\n\nthe manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, so made as\nto justify another person in understanding that his assent to that\nbargain is invited and will conclude it. (R2: \u00a724)\n\n\nTo establish a contract, the offer must be met with an appropriate\n\u201cacceptance\u201d, typically\n\n\na manifestation of assent to the terms [of the offer] made by the\nofferee in a manner invited or required by the offer. (\u00a750)\n\n\nBoth formulations closely track conventional philosophical accounts of\npromising, in which a promise arises when a person\n\n\ncommunicates \u2026 an intention to undertake by the very act of\ncommunication an obligation to perform an action and invest the\naddressee with a right to its performance. (Raz 1977:\n210\u2013211)\n\n\nSeveral theorists connect such language to the view that contract law\nenforces promissory morality\u2014that is, moral duties incurred by\npromising. In Contract as Promise, Charles Fried (1981; 2014:\n20) argues that the \u201ccentral organizing moral and doctrinal\nprinciple of contracts is the promise principle\u201d, according to\nwhich \u201ca promise is a kind of moral invention\u2026 [that]\nallows persons to create obligation where there was none\nbefore\u201d. While the importance of realizing such ends as\ninterpersonal trust and coordination may be part of what explains the\nvalue in enforcing promises, on Fried\u2019s view, promissory\ncompliance is \u201can end in itself\u201d. Likewise, Seana Shiffrin\n(2007: 721) invokes contract law\u2019s \u201cexplicit\nself-representation\u201d as a law of promissory obligation as a\nreason for evaluating the law based on the standards of promissory\nmorality.\n\nThe promise-conception finds support in the prevailing remedial scheme\nfor breaches of contract. The standard remedy for breach is money\ndamages that approximate the promisee\u2019s valuation of the\npromised performance. The law calls the remedy \u201cexpectation\ndamages\u201d (R2: \u00a7344 cmt. A). The expectation remedy does not\nsimply \u201cundo\u201d harms suffered by the promisee through\nreliance on the promisor. Rather, the promisor must affirmatively\nvindicate the promisee\u2019s expectation of performance by putting\nthe promisee in as good a position as the promisee would have enjoyed\nhad the promisor performed. To illustrate, if S promises to\nsell B widgets for $4 that B expects to resell at\n$10 for a $6 profit and S fails to deliver the widgets, then\nB\u2019s expectation interest is $6 so long as B\nhasn\u2019t yet paid for the widgets. If B has already made\nthe $4 payment to S, then the expectation interest is $10.\nSince the law opts for expectation over \u201creliance\u201d\ndamages\u2014an alternative measure that returns the parties to their\npre-contractual state\u2014it enforces promissory duties indirectly\nby requiring the promisor to insure the promisee\u2019s value of\nperformance. This feature of contract law distinguishes it from tort\nlaw, where the remedial aim is very much that of restoring a\nstatus quo ante disturbed by a wrong.\n\nThe role that fault plays in breach reinforces contract\u2019s\nconnection to promise and its difference from tort. Whereas tort\nliability is typically fault-based\u2014most torts require intent or\nnegligence\u2014contractual liability is strict and can arise without\nany fault in a promisor. A person might take all reasonable care to\navoid making promises she cannot keep and might make every\ncost-justified effort to keep whatever contractual promises she has\nmade. Yet (with only a few exceptions under narrow doctrines, such as\nimpossibility or frustration of purpose) when the promisor makes and\nbreaks a contractual promise, she remains liable even if performance\nbecomes unexpectedly burdensome or she is unable to perform because of\nthe actions of a third party. Standard accounts of contract therefore\nemphasize that the duty to vindicate the promisee\u2019s expectations\nis legally robust and not easily excused; though for an opposing view\non the significance of fault in contract, see Hillman (2014).\n\nThe contract-as-promise view confronts challenges along three\ndimensions:\n\nwhether promissory morality is a legitimate ground for state\ncoercion;\nwhether the moral assumptions underwriting the view are plausible;\nand\nwhether a promise-based theory can account for certain prominent\nand well-established doctrines of contract law.\n\n\nFirst, it is unclear why a liberal state would be justified in\npromoting promissory virtue for its own sake, which seems a far more\ncontroversial end for the state to adopt than various others that\nmight justify enforcing promises (such as preventing harm to promisees\nor efficient coordination; see below). Raz (1982: 937) argues that\n\u201cenforcing voluntary obligations is not itself a proper goal for\ncontract law\u201d because \u201c[t]o enforce voluntary obligations\n[for their own sake]\u201d would be \u201cto enforce morality\nthrough the legal imposition of duties on individuals\u201d. Raz\nadds, \u201c[i]n this respect, [enforcing promissory morality] does\nnot differ from the legal proscription of pornography\u201d. This\nchallenge is aligned with neutralist conceptions of liberalism. A\nstate that aims at relative neutrality on contested moral claims and\nrestraint in the exercise of power must connect the enforcement of\ncontracts to ends that are widely embraced as worthwhile.\n\nSecond, the moral assumptions about promising that the view imports\nappear questionable. Proponents of the promise-conception endorse what\nRaz (2014) calls the \u201cbare reasons\u201d of promising. The view\nentails that an act of promising generates a moral reason to keep\none\u2019s promise that is independent of (a) the moral desirability\nof the promised acts, (b) whether or not the promisee relied on the\npromise and might be harmed or disappointed by its breach, and (c) the\nvalue in having a mechanism that allows us to bind ourselves. Of\ncourse, this \u201cbare\u201d reason to keep one\u2019s promise\nmight be overridden by competing considerations. Additionally, a\npromise may not generate reasons unless certain conditions are\nsatisfied, including conditions related to the promisor\u2019s\nfreedom from coercion (for the legal analogue of this moral\nrequirement, see R2: \u00a7175), their capacity to promise (cf.\n\u00a7\u00a714, 15, 16), and the promise\u2019s content falling\nwithin certain moral bounds (compare with the illegality doctrine:\n\u00a7178). Still, provided key enabling conditions are met, the\npromise-conception proposes that even bare promises\u2014promises\nwhose breach will not undermine anyone\u2019s trust or cause any\nreliance-based harms\u2014generate moral obligations. But it is\npuzzling why such obligations should arise. The puzzle is clearest if\nobligations are grounded in people\u2019s interests. It is difficult\nto say what interest might support the duty to keep a bare promise,\nsince the ordinary interests that might be in play\u2014associated\nwith reliance and expectations\u2014have been excluded by\nconstruction. Thoughts like these led David Hume to worry that\npromissory obligations purport to \u201carise[] from our mere will\nand pleasure\u201d and to compare such obligations to the mystery of\ntransubstantiation, insofar as both involve intentions that purport to\n\u201cchange[] entirely the nature of an external object, and even of\na human creature\u201d (A Treatise of Human Nature, Bk. III,\nPt. 2, Ch. v).\n\nThe contract-as-promise view must defend bare promissory reasons\nagainst such skepticism. A proposal owing to Owens (2006) treats the\nbreach of a promissory duty as a \u201cbare wronging\u201d, one that\nneedn\u2019t set back any \u201cnon-normative interest\u201d of the\npromisee\u2014for example, their general interest in\nwellbeing\u2014but does set back the promisee\u2019s\n\u201cnormative interest\u201d in having a measure of authority over\nthe promisor. This view may be subject to a circularity challenge. The\nclaim that promisees have normative interests appears to presuppose\nthe fact that needs to be explained\u2014namely, that promises have\nthe relevant authority-conferring effects. For a broader discussion of\nthese and related issues, see the general entry on\n promises,\n bearing in mind that not just any moral theory of promising can be\nslotted into the contract-as-promise view. The view is not\u2014and\ncannot\u2014be neutral on the nature of promissory obligation, given\nthe character of the views it opposes.\n\nFinally, a central challenge for the promise conception is the\ndivergence of well-established legal rules from the rules of\npromissory morality. Shiffrin (2007) offers examples of divergence to\ncriticize the law. For instance, contract law only enforces promises\nthat are supported by adequate \u201cconsideration\u201d. The\nconsideration doctrine, in its modern form, requires a promise to be\npart of a bargain. The Restatement states that\n\n\n[a] performance or return promise is bargained for if it is sought by\nthe promisor in exchange for his promise and is given by the promisee\nin exchange for that promise. (R2: \u00a771)\n\n\nContracts, in other words, arise out of an exchange of promises where\neach party\u2019s promise triggers the other\u2019s, in what Oliver\nWendell Holmes (1881 [1991: 293\u2013294]) calls \u201creciprocal\nconventional inducement\u201d. In exceptional circumstances, a\ngratuitous promise may be enforced in the absence of consideration.\nCertain promises (especially concerning contract modifications) made\namong merchants are enforceable without consideration, as are promises\nto make charitable subscriptions (R2 \u00a790(2); Uniform Commercial\nCode [\u201cUCC\u201d] \u00a7 2-209). More generally, the doctrine\nof promissory estoppel enforces promises that are detrimentally relied\non when considerations of justice demand it (R2 \u00a790). But\npromissory estoppel is in practice narrowly construed and rarely\ninvoked by courts (for a leading case applying the rule in the context\nof pre-contractual bargaining, see Hoffman v. Red Owl Stores,\nInc. [1965], and for a survey of the law that shows\nHoffman\u2019s exceptional status, see Schwartz and Scott\n[2007]).\n\nThe consideration doctrine presents a challenge for the\ncontract-as-promise theory because the rules of promissory morality do\nnot limit obligations in any analogous way. Other limits on contract\nlaw\u2019s willingness to enforce promises\u2014for instance,\ndoctrines relating to fraud and duress\u2014 might track analogous\nlimits in the morality of promising. But there is no obvious reason to\nsuppose that a gratuitous promise\u2014to collect a friend from the\nairport, to give a child a coveted treat, or to keep a friend\u2019s\nsecret\u2014cannot generate moral obligations. The challenge is\nbolstered by the fact that the consideration requirement remains\nentrenched in the common law of contracts despite repeated academic\ncriticism. Even civil law, which includes no formal analog to\nconsideration, nevertheless favors legal enforcement of exchange\npromises in a number of ways.\n\nA second doctrinal challenge to the theory resides in the law\u2019s\nacceptance\u2014and apparent encouragement\u2014of \u201cefficient\nbreach\u201d. As noted above, the standard remedy for breach of\ncontract, expectation damages, vindicates contractual rights through\nsubstitutionary relief: it provides disappointed promisees with a\nmoney award equal to their value of performance. The remedy of\n\u201cspecific performance\u201d\u2014a court injunction ordering\nthe promisor to do as she promised\u2014would more directly enforce\nthe duty to perform. Yet specific performance is not the primary or\nusual judicial remedy. Moreover, the expectation remedy\u2014in fact\nand perhaps also by design\u2014encourages contractual promisors to\nbreach when the costs of performance (including the opportunity costs\nof diverting performance to higher-valuing third parties) exceed the\nvalue of the promisee\u2019s performance. If S promises to\nsell a widget for $10 to B, who values the widget at $15, and\nC offers to buy the same widget from S for $16, then\nthe expectation remedy gives S an incentive to sell to\nC, pay B $5 in expectation damages, and pocket the\nadditional dollar. The breach is efficient insofar as the widget ends\nup in the hands of the party that values it most, and this efficiency\nis cited (both in legal theory and by courts) as a reason for denying\nspecific performance (N. Ind. Pub. Serv. Co. v. Carbon County\nCoal (1986)). By contrast, morality gives promisors no equivalent\nflexibility. This has dismayed some theorists who are attracted to\ncontract as promise (Friedmann 1989). Others deny that there is any\nfundamental conflict, reinterpreting the expectation remedy in terms\nof an implied promise in the alternative, which allows promisors the\nchoice of performing by trading a good for its price or by\ntransferring money equal to the promisee\u2019s value of trade\n(Markovits & Schwartz 2011). Sophisticated parties have good\nreason to make contractual promises in this way, as doing so maximizes\ntheir gains from trade. But unsophisticated parties may think\ncontracts require simple performance and view the legal option of\nsubstituting damages for performance as immoral.\n\nShiffrin and others take departures from promissory morality to be\nreasons for law reform. However, given that theoretical work in this\narea proceeds on the assumption that the normativity of contract law\nis worth engaging with on its own terms, there is reason for desiring\na theory that is not too revisionary. While the contract-as-promise\ntheory is explanatorily powerful and morally appealing, its adequacy\nin the final analysis turns on whether it can plausibly explain away\nthe tensions it perceives in contract law, a question that remains\nvery much unsettled.\n1.2 The duty not to harm & the promisee\u2019s reliance interest\n\nBroken promises typically impose tangible burdens on the promisee in\nthe form of costs (including opportunity costs) incurred in reliance\non a promise or in the form of disappointed expectations. If these\ncosts can be classified as harms, then promissory representations\nimplicate the duty not to harm. In other words,\n\n\n[i]f there is a general principle that one ought not cause harm to\nothers, that might be enough to justify some sort of rule against\n[agreement-breaking]. (Craswell 1989: 499)\n\n\nOn the harm-based view, contract law is analogous to tort law\u2014an\ninstance of a broader class of regulations enforcing harm-based\nobligations. More specifically, contract elaborates liability for\nmisrepresentation\u2014including not just fraud but also negligent\nmisrepresentation\u2014especially insofar as analogous doctrines in\nthe law of torts appear artificially cabined.\n\nThe leading contemporary proponent of the harm-based theory is T.M.\nScanlon, who argues that contract law imports the moral principles\ngoverning harm-avoidance into law (Scanlon 1998: 295\u2013327; 2001:\n93\u201394). Scanlon\u2019s view begins with pre-promissory moral\nprinciples that no one could \u201creasonably reject\u201d, which\nforbid certain ways of manipulating others and, moreover, require\npersons to exercise care in leading others to form expectations.\nScanlon explains the wrongfulness of lying and imposing misimpressions\nbased on these principles. He then defends a more specific principle\nof promissory fidelity:\n\n\nPrinciple of Fidelity: If (1) A voluntarily and\nintentionally leads B to expect that A will do\nX (unless B consents to A\u2019s not doing\nso); (2) A knows that B wants to be assured of this;\n(3) A acts with the aim of providing this assurance, and has\ngood reason to believe that he or she has done so; (4) B\nknows that A has the intentions and beliefs just described;\n(5) A intends for B to know this, and knows that\nB does know it; (6) B knows that A has this\nknowledge and intent, then, in the absence of special justification,\nA must do X unless B consents to\nX\u2019s not being done. (Scanlon 1998: 304)\n\n\nThe principle of fidelity articulates a first-order duty to keep\none\u2019s promises, grounded not in the simple fact of promising, as\non the bare reasons view, but in the fact that promises give\nassurances that lead to reasonable reliance and a risk of harm. The\nprinciple calls for doing as one has promised and not just making up a\ndisappointed promisee\u2019s losses, but it does not prescribe any\nspecific legal enforcement scheme. Consequently, an important\nchallenge for the view is explaining contract law\u2019s standard\nremedy for breach, which obliges the promisor to vindicate the\npromisee\u2019s expectation and not merely reimburse her for costs\nincurred through reliance.\n\nScanlon suggests that no one could reasonably reject a legal remedy\nthat protects the promisee\u2019s expectations given the substantial\nbenefits to promisees and the low costs to promisors (Scanlon 2001:\n105\u2013111). But the costs to promisors of a principle requiring\ncompensation for expectations may not be all that low. Scanlon\nimagines that promisors can easily avoid the special remedial\nobligations by qualifying their intentional representations with:\n\u201cof course, I\u2019m not promising\u201d. But such a\ndisclaimer, in the context of a regime that enforces promises,\nundermines the credibility of the communicated intention. A person who\nwishes to credibly signal her intent to perform while hoping to avoid\nliability for her promisee\u2019s expectations appears disempowered\nby Scanlon\u2019s regime.\n\nEven if a principle that enforces promissory expectations cannot\nreasonably be rejected, this still does not fully explain why the law\nfavors expectations. Some alternative remedy might equally fall within\nthe bounds of moral principles no one could reasonably reject. For\ninstance, the law could compensate based on reliance damages,\nreturning parties to their pre-contractual state in the event of\nbreach. Of course, the practical difference between vindicating\nexpectations and reliance-based losses is not always substantial. Lon\nFuller and William Perdue (1936) discuss cases where the two remedial\nschemes converge, as when markets are thick. Where a promisee\u2019s\nreliance on her promisor includes forsaking an identically attractive\noffer, then the promisee\u2019s reliance interest arguably equals her\nvaluation of performance\u2014that is, her contractual expectation.\nMoreover, a number of legal rules cabin the expectation remedy by\nimposing requirements of foreseeability (see, e.g., Hadley v.\nBaxendale (1854)) and mitigating one\u2019s losses (R2:\n\u00a7350); and the law sometimes opts for reliance damages where\nexpectation is hard to measure (see, e.g., Sullivan v.\nO\u2019Connor (1972)). Still, reliance and expectation are not\nalways congruent, and the law\u2019s clear preference for the latter\nrequires an explanation.\n\nA deeper problem is that Scanlon\u2019s defense of a regime that\nenforces contractual expectations does not fully vindicate the law,\nsince it presupposes moral constraints that have no legal analogue.\nScanlon (2001: 105) suggests that enforcing a promisee\u2019s\nexpectation is appropriate only if the compensatory burden is not\n\u201cexcessive\u201d and only if the promisor had \u201cadequate\nopportunity\u201d to avoid it based on an \u201cadequate\nunderstanding\u201d of their situation at the time of promising. But\nthe law does not qualify the promisor\u2019s duty in these ways. A\npromisor might have every intention to comply with a promise and yet\nlater find that, due to events she reasonably did not foresee, the\ncost of her performance has risen dramatically or the value to her of\nthe other side\u2019s promise has fallen. It is hardly obvious that\npromise-breaking in such cases violates the duty not to harm (could\nthe promisee reasonably expect the promisor to keep her promise in\nthis scenario?) or that it would be fair to make the promise-breaker\nliable for the promisee\u2019s full expectation (did the promisor\nhave a reasonable opportunity ex ante to avoid the burden?). While the\nlaw excuses breach if the unexpected costs of performance are\nextraordinary (under the doctrines of \u201cimpossibility\u201d and\n\u201cimpracticability\u201d, see R2: \u00a7261) or if the decrease\nin the value of the bargain is similarly substantial (see\n\u201cfrustration of purpose\u201d, R2: \u00a7269), these excuses\nare only available in exceptional circumstances (a leading case on\nimpracticability, Alcoa v. Essex (1980), involved unexpected\ncosts greater than $50 million). Historically, the common law\u2019s\npacta sunt servanda (\u201cagreements must be kept\u201d)\nprinciple used to be enforced quite unforgivingly (see Paradine v.\nJane (1647)); and while courts now recognize a broader category\nof excuses for non-performance, the law\u2019s remedial demands are\nnot so clearly consistent with Scanlon\u2019s moral framework.\n\nFinally, the harm-based view conceives of promissory duties as arising\nonly when the promisee reasonably relied or formed\nreasonable expectations. This invites the question of what\nmight ground the reasonableness of reliance or expectations. The\nanswer cannot be that the promisor is obligated by her promise and it\nis reasonable for the promisee to expect the promisor to honor her\nobligations. As an account of promissory obligation, this argument\ntravels a (very short) circle. The theoretical problem, moreover, is\ndirectly captured in law, given the contrast between contract and the\nmisrepresentation torts. These torts include, among their elements,\nthat defendants must have failed to exercise reasonable care in making\nfalse statements and, additionally, require plaintiffs to have\njustifiably relied on defendants\u2019 false statements (Restatement\n(Second) of Torts \u00a7552). Moreover, tort law expressly adds that a\nparty asserting liability for misrepresentations must have relied\nspecifically on the representations\u2019 being true, rather than\njust \u201cupon the expectation that the maker [of the false\nstatement] will be held liable in damages for its falsity\u201d\n(\u00a7548). Contract takes the opposite approach. As Learned Hand\nobserved in discussing warranties:\n\n\n[A warranty is] an assurance by one party to a contract of the\nexistence of a fact upon which the other party may rely. It is\nintended precisely to relieve the promisee of any duty to ascertain\nthe fact for himself; it amounts to a promise to indemnify the\npromisee for any loss if the fact warranted proves untrue, for\nobviously the promisor cannot control what is already in the past.\n(Metropolitan Coal Co. v. Howard 1946)\n\n\nIn other words, a kind of bootstrapping\u2014where the law generates\nexpectations of enforcement that it regards as a reason for\nenforcement\u2014is of the essence in contract.\n\nA more detailed look at doctrine compounds the explanatory challenge.\nFor example, the law does not allow contracting parties to escape\nliability by providing advance warning of breach (on\n\u201canticipatory repudiation\u201d, see Hochster v. De La\nTour (1853)). Contractual obligations are imposed notwithstanding\na promisor\u2019s attempt to negate their promissory intent and the\npromisee\u2019s reasonable reliance immediately after an apparent act\nof promising (see Lucy v. Zehmer (1954)). More generally, the\nharm-based view struggles to explain why the law imposes liability\neven if the promisee incurs no reliance costs or when the promisor is\nknown to be unreliable. In CBS Inc. v. Ziff-Davis Publishing\nCo. (1990), the seller of a business warranted certain claims\nregarding the business\u2019 profitability. The buyer, after\nindependent investigation, confessed that he didn\u2019t think the\nwarranted representations were true. The court ruled that the\nbuyer\u2019s lack of belief in and reliance on the truth of the\nwarranted information did not relieve the seller of its obligations\nunder the warranty. Such rulings are prima facie puzzling on\nthe harm-based view.\n1.3 Enabling mutually beneficial exchange\n\nThere is room to question whether the law (especially in a liberal\nstate) should be in the business of enforcing moral duties associated\nwith promising. The economic approach to contract law de-emphasizes\ncontract\u2019s promissory roots and instead locates the law\u2019s\njustification in general welfare: the rules of contract law enable\nsocially productive reliance on promises and mutually beneficial\nexchange. This approach is more prominent among academic lawyers than\namong philosophers, and is widely regarded, at least in the United\nStates, as the leading interdisciplinary approach to contract law.\n\nThe economic analysis of contract begins, in effect, with Hume\u2019s\nobservation that\n\n\nexperience has taught us, that human affairs wou\u2019d be conducted\nmuch more for mutual advantage, were there certain symbols or signs\ninstituted, by which we might give each other security of our conduct\nin any particular incident. (A Treatise of Human Nature, bk.\n3, pt. II, sec. v [Of the Obligation of Promises], emphasis\nremoved)\n\n\nWhen parties exchange promises as part of a bargain, they usually\nstand to gain from mutual performance, but in the absence of a\ncommitment mechanism, each has an incentive to defect; and, since the\nparties can foresee the defections, they might fail to invest in and\nor enter into mutually beneficial bargains. The law prevents\nself-interest from getting in the way of mutual advantage by\nenabling\n\n\nindividuals to bind themselves to a future course of conduct, to make\nit easier for others to arrange their lives in reliance on [a]\npromise. (Craswell 1989: 496; see generally Goetz & Scott 1980;\ncf. Atiyah 1979)\n\n\nThis power-conferring conception of contract law is generally\nunderstood as having normative import: contracts should be enforced\njust insofar as doing so (by increasing confidence in the promises\nthat they contain) establishes optimal incentives for reliance and\nmaximizes the joint surplus produced through contractual coordination\n(see, e.g., Schwartz & Scott 2003: 541). A striking upshot is that\nnothing in the intrinsic character of contract law favors\npromise-based or chosen obligation; instead, everything depends on\ncontingent facts about which legal forms coordinate mutual reliance in\nthe most \u201cefficient\u201d or welfare maximizing way.\n\nMost lawyer-economists adopt an overtly revisionary stance towards\nparticular legal rules. Some argue that the law should be more\nsolicitous of promissory reliance in the absence of\nconsideration\u2014especially reliance on pre-contractual\nrepresentations\u2014than orthodox contract doctrine allows (see,\ne.g., Bebchuk & Ben-Shahar 2001: 427; Ben-Shahar 2004; Craswell\n1996; Johnston 1999; Katz 1996). In addition, and independently, the\neconomic approach rejects orthodox contract law\u2019s categorical\npreference for expectation-based remedies. Such remedies may or may\nnot support optimal reliance; but in either case, the promise-based\nidea of securing the promisee\u2019s expectations \u201cwill not\nhave played any role in the analysis leading up to [the]\nconclusion\u201d about which remedy is optimal (Craswell 2000:\n107).\n\nAlthough no longer seen as a primarily descriptive theory, the\neconomic approach appears to rationalize established doctrines that\ncompeting views struggle to explain. The approach seems tailormade to\nexplain the law\u2019s encouragement of \u201cefficient\nbreach\u201d (discussed earlier, in\n \u00a71.1).\n Though even here there are puzzles. It remains unclear why contract\nlaw is unwilling to promote efficiency through orders of specific\nperformance (Ayres & Klass 2017). After all, it is likely costly\nto deal with an unwilling counterparty forced to perform, so promisees\nwill usually seek specific performance only when expectation damages\nare genuinely undercompensatory or hard to calculate (Schwartz 1979).\nAt the very least, an efficient contract law should allow parties, ex\nante, to contract for the specific performance remedy or even for\nsupra-compensatory \u201cpenalties\u201d that assure performance by\nrequiring damages upon breach that exceed the promisee\u2019s\nexpectation interest (see discussion in Edlin 1996; Edlin &\nSchwartz 2003; Shavell 1980). But, in fact, the law does not condone\nsuch agreements, even between sophisticated parties (R2: \u00a7356;\nsee, e.g., Lake River v. Carborundum (1985)). A possible\nexplanation is that penalty clauses enable inefficient collusion by\nestablished firms to keep new entrants out of markets.\n\nThe view that contract law, in its positive expression, promotes\nefficient investment and exchange is hard to maintain in the face of\ndoctrinal challenges (see, e.g., Posner 2003). \u201cThis is Not a\nLegally Enforceable Agreement\u201d clauses used by parties to\ndisclaim their intent for an agreement to be legally enforceable are\nnot always enforced. Similarly, efforts by parties to opt out of legal\nduties in the pre-contractual bargaining phase, including duties\nrelated to disclosure of information, are often deemed legally\nineffective (V.S.H. v. Texaco (1985)). In all such cases, the\nlaw\u2019s reluctance to cater to parties\u2019 preferences is not\nstraightforwardly explainable in power-conferring or general welfarist\nterms. For an exploration of the degree to which the law\u2019s\nmandatory constraints can be explained from the standpoint of\nefficiency, see Zamir and Ayres (2020).\n\nAnother explanatory puzzle is broader and focuses not on specific\ndoctrines but rather on contract law\u2019s generic structure. The\neconomic approach is free to focus on efficiency and to disregard both\ndistributive fairness and freedom only insofar as it ignores the\ninequities and vulnerabilities that figure in the lives of natural\npersons. The most sophisticated economists recognize this and limit\nthe domain of their arguments to contracts among firms owned by\ndiversified shareholders (see, e.g., Schwartz & Scott 2003). This\nfocus on firms suits the efficiency standard: firms are artificial\nentities, so that concerns about freedom and autonomy are irrelevant\nto regulating their behavior. Moreover, the diversified holdings of\nthe natural persons who own the firms cause legal rules to have no\ndistributive effects across owners since the owners hold shares in\nfirms that are benefited as well as those that are burdened by every\nlegal rule. The firms that the economic approach focuses on are,\ntherefore, mere instrumentalities of shareholders who, insofar as they\nown (or could own) diversified portfolios, are all more or less\nidentically situated with respect to every transaction that contract\nlaw might regulate. This suggests that the economic approach abandons\na basic presupposition from which the study of contract law as the law\nof agreements ordinarily begins. Contracts, intuitively understood,\ninvolve coordination among multiple parties with distinct interests.\nBut there is a sense in which the transactions modelled by economic\ntheory ultimately involve only one such party: the diversified\nshareholder who stands behind the firms on both sides of every\ncontract. This is of course an idealized model, and actual firms will\noften have differentiated owners. Nevertheless, the model casts doubt\non whether transactions among firms should be understood, in the end,\nto be agreements at all.\n\nFinally, the economic view\u2019s normative assumptions have been\nsubject to criticism. Dworkin (1975: 1061) argues that judges should\ndecide bilateral disputes based on the parties\u2019 established\nrights and considerations of interpersonal fairness, while leaving the\ncrafting of rules based on general welfare to \u201c[t]he political\nsystem of representative democracy\u201d. The economic approach seems\nto ignore these limits to judicial authority. A different normative\ncritique (discussed more broadly within the entry on the\n philosophy of economics)\n targets the definition of welfare that animates work in this area.\nEconomists tend to equate the parties\u2019 welfare with preference\nsatisfaction, while inferring the strength of preferences based on a\nwillingness to pay. This approach biases measurements of efficiency in\nfavor of the rich given that the willingness to pay is sensitive to\nbackground endowments (Liscow 2018). In the context of contractual\nexchange, an approach that aims to maximize preference satisfaction is\nat least more or less constrained by the Pareto criterion (an outcome\ncounts as a Pareto improvement only if it is preferred by at least one\nperson and not dispreferred by anyone), because both parties to every\ncontract must agree before it becomes enforceable. But even here, the\npreference-satisfaction/welfare equivalence remains vulnerable to\ncritique for being based on an impoverished account of the social good\n(Radin 1987; Murphy 2014; Mullen 2016).\n1.4 The normativity of the contract relation\n\nTort law concerns obligations among strangers. But contract law\nconcerns obligations among parties who have a special relationship to\neach other, including the relationship constructed by the contract\nitself. Raz (1977: 228) writing about promises, has suggested that\nbare reasons for keeping promises \u201ccan only be justified if the\ncreation of [the] special relationships between people [that even bare\npromises involve] is held to be valuable.\u201d However, Raz declines\n\u201cto argue that the special relationships the desirability of\nwhich would validate [bare promissory obligations] are indeed\ndesirable.\u201d\n\n\nSome contract theorists embrace Raz\u2019s formal observation and\nseek to ground contract law in one or another substantive conception\nof the value of the special relationships that exist among contracting\nparties.\n\nOne version of this approach emphasizes that contracts generally (some\ntheorists claim always) arise inside already existing commercial and\neven social relationships. The \u201ctheory of relational\ncontracting\u201d seeks the basis for enforcing contractual promises\nin the norms that govern the background relationships. Legal\nsociologists working in this vein have emphasized that contracting,\nespecially in commercial contexts, relies on the parties\u2019\nantecedent commitments to integrity or \u201ccommon honesty and\ndecency\u201d (Macaulay 1963). Others emphasize social norms\ninvolving reciprocity and respect, especially within close-knit\ncontracting communities (Bernstein 1992). Still others approach\ncontract law through a theory of exchange relations according to which\nevery contract is \u201cnecessarily partially\u201d embedded in a\nthick context of extra-legal relations, from which it draws its legal\nauthority and force (Macneil 1980).\n\nAnother set of theories emphasizes the formal structure of the legal\nrelation of contract itself, even apart from any commercial or social\nrelationships within which it arises (Markovits 2004; Bensen 2019).\nThe doctrines governing offer and acceptance require contractual\npromisors to form (and to communicate) intentions that refer to their\npromisees. The parties to contracts, that is, intend to pursue ends\nthat do not merely coincide but rather, to borrow a formulation from\nDavid Hume, \u201chave a reference to\u201d each other (A\nTreatise of Human Nature, L.A. III, 2, ii.). Moreover, each\npromisor intends not simply to do things but to be bound to do things,\nentrenching her deference to the promisee, intending to perform unless\nreleased. Her obligation endures at his option, so that she gives him\npower over her normative situation. Contracts, that is, establish the\ntransaction as a normative unit.\n\nA contractual promisor\u2019s intentions, moreover, run not just to\nher own interest in the joint contractual project, or even to her\npromisee\u2019s interest in this project (as she understands it), but\nrather to his perspective on the project, as this is the perspective\nfrom which he will decide whether to insist on her performance or to\nrelease her. In this way, the promisor recognizes her promisee as an\nauthority over her, with respect to the promised contractual\nperformance. She treats as a final end not just the joint activities\ndescribed by her contracts but also his person\u2014his will (which\nmay insist on or relieve the duty to perform). Borrowing from Kant,\none might even say that a contract constitutes \u201can act of the\nunited choice of two persons\u201d (The Metaphysics of\nMorals 6:271) so that offers and acceptances are\n\u201crepresented not as following upon one another but \u2026 as\nproceeding from a single common will\u201d (6:273). Every\ncontract, on this view, establishes a shared perspective over the\ncontemplated performance.\n\nContractual obligations, according to such theories, are grounded in\nthe value of a shared perspective. On one version, this value lies in\nthe recognition immanent in the perspective, as promisors and\npromisees each treat the other as an independent person, imbued with\nthe special normative status that asserting contractual authority\ninvolves. This approach treats the duty of good faith in performance,\nwhich the common law makes mandatory in every contract (UCC:\n\u00a71-304; R2: \u00a7205), as contract law\u2019s core doctrine,\nbecause it requires parties to show fidelity to the shared perspective\nof the contract relation when they administer their contracts\n(Markovits 2014). On another version, the value of the contract\nrelation lies in the transfer of rights, completed at the moment of\ncontract formation. This approach treats the consideration doctrine,\nwhich other theories regard as poorly justified and marginal to\ncontract law, as contract\u2019s central, organizing principle.\nConsideration ensures that every contract is indeed constituted as a\ntransaction involving an exchange of rights (Benson 2019).\n\nAccounts of contract that emphasize the normativity of the contract\nrelation face a shared challenge, although it expresses itself\ndifferently for different versions of the view. The challenge is to\nexplain why the motives parties adopt in the shadow of legal\nenforcement do not undermine the value of the special relationship,\nwhose desirability grounds contractual obligation on the relational\nmodel. Theorists who embed the contract relation inside pre-existing\nsocial and moral relationships must explain why the self-interested\nmotives associated with contractual compliance\u2014\u201cgreed and\nfear\u201d as G. A. Cohen (2009: 40\u201344) puts it\u2014do not\n\u201ccrowd out\u201d the desirable attitudes and motives out of\nwhich the enveloping pre-legal relationships are built. This concern\nhas been much discussed\u2014both the empirical reality of crowding\nout (see, e.g., Deci, Koestner, & Ryan 1999; Gneezy and Rustichini\n2000) and its normative significance for valued social relationships\n(Atiq 2014). Theorists who understand contract as a free-standing\nrelation can avoid this challenge and might even embrace the crowding\nout of socially thicker motives as a feature of the contract relation\nrather than a bug (Markovits 2011). But the general problem remains in\nplace of explaining how an arm\u2019s-length relation among\nself-interested parties might establish a morally desirable form of\nsolidarity. This challenge becomes especially pressing in light of the\nfact that most contracts have organizations as a party (Leib 2015).\nOrganizations lack the properties of natural persons out of which the\nrelational theories build their accounts of the normativity of the\ncontract relation. Whereas contracts among organizations are the\nnatural domain for economic theories (see\n \u00a71.3),\n they are difficult for relational theories to compass.\n1.5 Pluralism\n\nThe criteria for measuring a contract theory\u2019s success remain\nvaguely defined, which is to be expected in an interpretive\nenterprise. We want our theory to fit and to explain contract law\ndoctrines that are themselves sometimes contested. In addition, we\nwant the law to be understood as worthy of our moral approval, with\nall the complexities and controversies that this involves. The\ncompeting theories of contract strike different balances between\nconsiderations of fit and justification and are based on competing\nviews about what the law is and what it should be. Moreover, the\ndifferences among the theories\u2014especially with respect to\njustification\u2014involve fundamental disagreements about value,\nwhich makes compromise elusive. Whether any balance can be sensibly\nstruck between, say, the value of promissory integrity and that of\nmaximizing the joint surplus from contractual exchange remains\nunclear.\n\nThe \u201cpluralist\u201d finds in this stalemate reasons to\nquestion whether contract law is animated by one evaluative goal or\nmaster principle, rather than a plurality of independent and perhaps\neven incommensurable evaluative aims. Pluralism is more often\npresupposed in the literature than directly defended, and what defense\nthere is usually takes the form of a critique of monistic views (see,\ne.g., Hillman 1998). The critique is qualified, however, since the\nmonistic views are portrayed as offering genuine even if incomplete\ninsights into contract law, contributing to the taxonomic project of\nmapping the values that undergird it (Hillman 1998; Klass 2008;\nKreitner 2012). For pluralism to be more than a negative thesis,\npluralists have considerable work to do in explaining contract\nlaw\u2019s plural commitments, ideally offering more than a grab-bag\nlist of values to be promoted (Lucy 2007).\n\nAn important question facing the pluralist is whether there are\nreasons for contract law\u2019s pluralism. The answer might seem\nobvious, as if it were lawyerly commonsense. The law of contracts has\ndeveloped over the course of several centuries, with many diverse\njuridical personalities disagreeing on how best to resolve contract\ndisputes. Some of the law\u2019s guiding principles have survived\nboth this competitive process and changing normative fashions in the\nbroader culture; others have been modified. The expectancy remedy and\npacta sunt servanda principles may be relics of a bygone\nage\u2019s commitment to bare promissory duty. But efficient breach\nand related doctrines have evolved to prevent promissory virtue from\ngetting in the way of social welfare, especially in economies marked\nby a high-frequency spot contracts among parties with no relationship\noutside of the contracts at issue. These tensions within contract law\nare, as one commentator puts it, \u201chistorical and political\naccidents\u201d (Alces 2008).\n\nBut there are also other explanatory possibilities. Contract\nlaw\u2019s distinctive pluralism may reflect an indeterminacy in the\nrealm of non-legal value. The promotion of promissory and\ncollaborative virtue, or general welfare, or careful promising to\navoid monetary harm, may be understood as falling largely within the\nrealm of the (institutional) supererogatory rather than the realm of\nduty or basic justice. And if there is genuine indeterminacy regarding\nhow these incompossible goods are to be integrated by a regime that\naspires to do what is best (rather than exclusively what is\nobligatory), then the character of contract law\u2019s pluralism\nmight be explained in terms of judges \u201csettling\u201d a\ngenuinely indeterminate moral question regarding the optimal\ninstitutional choice (Atiq 2018: 78, 88\u201397). Contract law is\nthus seen not as the incoherent end result of judges disagreeing on\nquestions of morality and the social good, but as a distinctly\njuridical solution to a genuine evaluative dilemma: quasi-legislative\nstipulation by judges of the precise mix of goods to be\ninstitutionally promoted. Law\u2019s usefulness in this regard,\nproviding closure on problems of value pluralism, has been explored\nmore generally in legal and political philosophy (see, e.g., Radbruch\n1932; Finnis 1980; Williams 1985; Waldron 1996, Berlin 2002).\n\nEven in this case, the central challenge facing the various strains of\npluralism remains in place: that of explaining how law integrates its\nseveral and often competing normative commitments. To what extent are\ndecisions informed by some \u201ccovering value\u201d, in Ruth\nChang\u2019s (2004) terminology, or synthesizing principles? A recent\nproposal suggests an organizing principle based on a typology of\ncontracts and contracting parties (Leib 2005). Wealth maximization may\nbe appropriate in the enforcement of contracts between firms, for\nexample, whereas promissory virtue becomes a more significant object\nof concern in contractual disputes between natural persons (see also\nC. Riley 2000). Along similar lines, Dagan and Heller (2017) suggest\nthat distinct contract-types implicate distinct values, and that the\norganizing principle that determines which normative structure applies\nis the choice principle\u2014the parties\u2019 freedom to choose the\nrules that govern their exchange relations. Such proposals sit\nuncomfortably with existing law, which does not explicitly distinguish\nthe application of its basic doctrines in this way, even if it\nshould.\n2. Philosophical Themes in the Law of Contracts\n\nThe second part of this entry explores questions in the philosophy of\nlanguage (on meaning and interpretation), philosophy of action (the\nmetaphysics of intention), and moral and political philosophy (freedom\nand distributive justice) as they arise in contract law.\n \u00a72.1\n discusses work that brings tools from the philosophy of language to\nbear on questions of contract interpretation.\n \u00a72.2\n examines the concept of freedom in contract through the lens of\nestablished doctrine and philosophical work on autonomy.\n \u00a72.3\n explores how the pairing of orthodox contract theory with modern\ndoctrine generates a puzzle about the nature of contractual intent.\nFinally,\n \u00a72.4\n considers questions of distributive justice raised by private\nexchange.\n2.1 Language, meaning, and interpretation\n\nThe law of contracts includes rules that map the parties\u2019 speech\nacts onto legal effects. What the rules are that relate speech to\nlegal obligation and what they ought to be are questions for legal and\nmoral theory. But the conventional answers may be clarified using\nresources from the philosophy of language (Farnsworth 1967; Rosen\n2011).\n\nWe begin with rules specifying the legally relevant feature of the\nparties\u2019 speech. What a person intends to mean by their words\ncan come apart from the actual meaning (the semantic content) of the\nwords. In general, contract law is said to privilege\n\u201cobjective\u201d over intended (or, as lawyers sometimes say:\n\u201csubjective\u201d) meaning as the basis for the parties\u2019\nlegal obligations, at least where the intended meaning is not evident\nfrom context:\n\n\nA contract has, strictly speaking, nothing to do with the personal, or\nindividual, intent of the parties. \u2026 If \u2026 it were proved\nby twenty bishops that either party, when he used the words, intended\nsomething else than the usual meaning which the law imposes upon them,\nhe would still be held, unless there were some mutual mistake or\nsomething else of the sort. (Hotchkiss v. National City Bank\n1911)\n\n\nThis preference for objective meaning, moreover, reaches the\ninterpretation of the speech acts through which contracts are entered\ninto, such as offers and acceptances (R2: \u00a724). Proponents of the\nso-called \u201cobjective theory of contracts\u201d regularly invoke\nthe \u201cusual\u201d, \u201cobjective\u201d,\n\u201creasonable\u201d, or \u201cplain\u201d meaning as\ndistinguished from the meaning that the parties \u201cattached\u201d\nto their words (R2: \u00a7201). Since talk of meaning is often\nambiguous, we must be cautious in interpreting such locutions. The\ngloss that\u2019s sometimes given in law is that objective meaning\nconcerns what a reasonable person in the position of the addressee\nwould have inferred was meant based on the available evidence.\n\nA related set of legal rules specify the core contractual text to be\ninterpreted and what evidence determines its meaning. The \u201cparol\nevidence rule\u201d (\u201cPER\u201d) establishes a preference for\nwritings over prior or contemporaneous oral agreements (UCC:\n\u00a72-202). The rule, in its traditional statement, entails that\nwhere a writing exists, oral agreements (inferable from testimony)\nthat are \u201cextrinsic\u201d to the \u201cfour corners of the\ndocument\u201d do not become part of the contract. Some versions of\nthe PER forbid the use of extrinsic evidence to \u201cintroduce an\nambiguity\u201d into a writing whose terms are otherwise clear and\nunambiguous. In addition, once the contours of a contractual text are\nset, principles of contract interpretation favor (to varying degrees\nin different jurisdictions) giving words meanings that are familiar to\njudges rather than meanings that are idiosyncratic to the parties. The\ninteraction between the PER and the principles of interpretation\nentails a complication that runs through the legal practice of\nextracting meaning\u2014namely that contracts themselves (especially\nwritten contracts) often seek to set their own boundaries and regulate\ntheir own interpretation, and the law both permits and resists such\nefforts.\n\n\u201cTextualism\u201d in contract law can be defined as the view\nthat (a) contractual obligations stem from the objective meaning of\nthe parties\u2019 speech acts, (b) writings trump oral communication,\nand (c) a text\u2019s meaning must be inferred from a restricted\nevidence-base. \u201cContextualists,\u201d by contrast, favor\nconsidering prior and contemporaneous oral agreements, which might\nhelp interpret, add to, or even vary the terms of a writing. There are\ngood reasons in favor of either textualist or contextualist approaches\nto fixing meaning, relating to the costs of drafting in the shadow of\nvarious interpretive regimes, the costs of litigating meaning, and the\ntemptations that parties face to make opportunistic claims about what\ntheir contracts require. But textualists and contextualists\nsometimes\u2014and much less plausibly\u2014cast their positions as\nrequired by basic and very general features of language.\n\nTextualists\u2014for example, Alex Kozinski, formerly a judge of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit)\u2014worry that\ncontextualism:\n\n\nchips away at the foundation of our legal system. By giving\ncredence to the idea that words are inadequate to express\nconcepts, [contextualism] undermines the basic principle that\nlanguage provides a meaningful constraint on public and private\nconduct. (Trident Center v. Connecticut General Life Ins. Co.\n1988)\n\n\nContextualists, for their part, sometimes seem to reject widely shared\nassumptions about language. Kozinski\u2019s opinion criticized a\nleading contextualist opinion by Roger Traynor, writing as Chief\nJustice of the Supreme Court of California. Traynor held that courts\nshould consider all extrinsic, contextual evidence to determine\nwhether written terms are ambiguous, while defending the holding based\non doubts about the \u201cinherent meaning of words\u201d:\n\n\nIf words had absolute and constant references, it might be possible to\ndiscover the contractual intention in the words themselves and in the\nmanner in which they were arranged. Words, however, do not have\nabsolute and constant references. A word is a symbol of thought but\nhas no arbitrary fixed meaning like a symbol of algebra or chemistry.\n(Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. G.W. Thomas Drayage &\nRigging Co. 1968)\n\n\nTraynor followed an influential tradition in legal scholarship\nskeptical not just of the parol evidence rule, but of the very\npossibility that the impersonal semantic content of the parties\u2019\nspeech acts might come apart from the contextually salient intended\nmeaning (see, e.g., Wigmore 1923: 378).\n\nFrom a philosophical perspective, these general arguments paint too\nquickly and with too broad a brush. On the one hand, practical\nconsiderations that support looking to broader context when\ninterpreting writings plainly do not undermine anything so general as\nthe idea that words can convey shared meaning. On the other hand, it\nwould equally be surprising if embracing contextualism meant having to\ndeny the platitude that speakers of language can be mistaken in ways\nthat allow public (or even legal) meaning to come apart in\ncontextually manifest ways from intended meaning. Contextualist\nskepticism about impersonal semantic content is surely separable from\nthe practical question of whether restricting the evidence base for\ndiscerning meaning best serves the various goals of contract law,\nincluding fairness to the parties and minimizing burdens on courts\n(Rosen 2011).\n\nGideon Rosen suggests an alternative conceptual framework for the\ndebate between textualists and contextualists, one that deemphasizes\nthe parties\u2019 semantic intentions. Following Grice (1957), we can\ndistinguish the parties\u2019 semantic intentions in relation to\ntheir speech acts (intentions to mean this or that by one\u2019s\nwords) from their pragmatic and distinctly legal intentions (the\nintent to cause legal effects via one\u2019s speech acts, like the\ncreation of a judicially enforceable promise). The parties\u2019\nlegal intentions\u2014which seem to matter, ultimately\u2014can come\napart from their semantic intentions. In re Soper\u2019s\nEstate (1935) offers an illustration. In that case, the deceased\ndesignated his \u201cwife\u201d as the beneficiary of his estate.\nHowever, Soper was legally married to person 1, faked his own death,\nand then \u201cmarried\u201d person 2. We can set aside what\n\u201cwife\u201d objectively means in this context. We can also\nstipulate that Soper\u2019s legal intention was to leave his estate\nto person 2. Suppose Soper\u2019s semantic intention was to refer to\n2 under the description my wife in the legal sense on the\nerroneous assumption that his prior marriage to 1 was not a legal\nimpediment. Clearly, the semantic intention to refer to 2 as his\nlegally recognized wife would have been irrelevant to what Soper was\ntrying to accomplish legally by writing his will. We can, of course,\nconstruct alternative scenarios where the semantic intention\nis relevant to Soper\u2019s legal intent. Indeed, contract\nlaw\u2019s interest in semantic intentions is explained by the fact\nthat, in general, what we intend to mean by our words bears on what we\nare trying to accomplish legally. But In re Soper\u2019s\nEstate illustrates that the connection is contingent\u2014the\nalignment that usually exists between the legal effects that we intend\nto produce and the descriptions under which we intend to produce them\nis far from guaranteed.\n\nAccordingly, the debate between textualists and contextualists might\nbe fruitfully recast in terms of: (a) whether the parties\u2019\nspeech acts should be mined for impersonal semantic content or the\nparties\u2019 legal intentions, and (b) whether the court should rely\non a narrow or broad evidence base to infer the legally relevant facts\nabout speech (Rosen 2011, 163). Rosen\u2019s framework is not\nintended to apply to situations where the parties have conflicting\nlegal intentions or cases where the contract is silent on the\nparties\u2019 responsibilities. Separate legal rules and\nconsiderations\u2014those concerning misunderstanding (R2: \u00a7201)\nand gap-filling (R2: \u00a7204)\u2014bear on such cases.\n\nIn re Soper\u2019s Estate illustrates a more general\nphenomenon of philosophical interest: natural language as a source of\ncontract disputes (Farnsworth 1967). Work in this area aims to\ncharacterize and distinguish the ways in which the parties\u2019\nlinguistic choices can interfere with contractual coordination. Famous\ncontract disputes have involved homonymy (two ships bear the name\n\u201cPeerless\u201d and the parties do not intend to refer to the\nsame ship: Raffles v. Wichelhaus (1864)), semantic ambiguity\n(the word \u201cchicken\u201d in the trade has a broader and\nnarrower meaning: Frigaliment Importing v B.N.S (1960)),\nsyntactic ambiguity (an insurance policy covers any \u201cdisease of\norgans of the body not common to both sexes\u201d: Business\nMen\u2019s Assur. Ass\u2019n v. R (1927)), pragmatic or\n\u201clatent\u201d ambiguity (In re Soper\u2019s Estate,\ndiscussed above); vagueness (parties agree that a \u201cmaterially\nadverse change\u201d to the financial health of a business qualifies\nthe buyer\u2019s obligations: In re Carter\u2019s Claim\n(1957)) and under-specification (parties agree to the sale of\n\u201cone of the seller\u2019s warehouses\u201d). For a general\ndiscussion of how to distinguish these and related phenomena, see the\nentry on\n ambiguity.\n2.2 Freedom and autonomy\n\nContract law is based on the model (or idealization) of\n\u201cvoluntary exchange \u2026 between autonomous\nindividuals\u201d (Radin 2007: 196). Contracts are enforced on the\nassumption that parties possess the capacities necessary for informed\nand voluntary choice (R2: \u00a715), while fraud, duress, and various\nforms of pressure in bargaining represent grounds for recission (R2:\n\u00a7\u00a7164, 175, 177). A preliminary question is why the law\nshould be so concerned with freedom and autonomy in contractual\nexchange. As previously discussed, the rearrangement of private\nproperty might be justified on grounds of efficiency or general\nwelfare (see\n \u00a71.3).\n The law\u2019s guiding principle could be hypothetical or reasonable\nconsent\u2014what parties would or should consent to\u2014rather\nthan actual consent. The importance of actual consent seems clear\nenough where exchange impinges on domains over which persons retain\nspecial sovereignty, including their own body and mind (Mill 1859;\nHill 1991; Enoch 2017). But not every contractual exchange impinges on\nbodily or mental integrity, and the importance of actual consent to\ncontracts at large is therefore not obvious.\n\nVoluntariness might be important to contracts for a number of reasons.\nA law of involuntary or forced exchange would risk people\u2019s\nwelfare, not just their autonomy. The parties\u2019 consent better\ntracks exchange efficiency than a court\u2019s judgment. Apart from\nwelfare concerns, if contractual obligation is grounded in promissory\nmorality (see\n \u00a71.1),\n then promissory principles constrain the law of contracts, including\nthose that condition an agent\u2019s responsibility on a promise\nhaving been made freely (Hurd 1996). The choice condition avoids\nunfairly holding individuals to duties that they lacked a reasonable\nopportunity to avoid incurring (cf. Scanlon 1998, Watson 1996).\n\nSince voluntariness in contract likely serves several distinct\nnormative functions, its analysis presents a challenge. What powers\nmust an agent exercise over her contractual affairs for her\nobligations to count as voluntarily undertaken? The law deems agents\nincapable of contracting if they lack either (1) the ability to\nunderstand the nature of a transaction and be responsive to reasons\nfor and against agreeing to it (see R2: \u00a715 and Buckareff and\nKasper-Buckareff 2014; on reasons-responsiveness as a general\ncriterion for moral responsibility, see Fischer and Ravizza 1998), or\n(2) the ability to exercise a degree of control over their choices.\nBix (2010) suggests that the common law follows Aristotle in treating\nan agent\u2019s knowledge and capacity to respond to her reasons, and\nnot just her capacity to act on desires she identifies with, as\nconstitutive of her freedom to contract. In addition to general\nincapacity, the common law recognizes specific threats to contractual\nfreedom, including lack of material information due to fraud or\nnon-disclosure, intoxication, duress, and, to a lesser extent,\ncognitive biases when preyed upon within a relationship of trust (R2:\n\u00a7\u00a7 16, 161\u2013163, 173\u2013175). The precise content of\nthese rules is controversial. For instance, there is no legal\nrequirement that parties disclose all relevant information in the\ngeneric commercial transaction (F. Miller & Wertheimer 2010), and\nthe line separating permissible from impermissible information\nasymmetries is deeply contested (Kronman 1978; Craswell 2006).\n\nThe concept of duress is similarly fraught. The law distinguishes\n\u201cphysical duress\u201d, which bypasses the coercee\u2019s\nrational control over her actions, from duress via \u201cwrongful\nthreats\u201d which operates through the will of the coercee (R2:\n\u00a7\u00a7 174-5; cf. Nozick 1969). A threat is considered wrongful\nwhen the threatened consequence leaves the coercee with \u201cno\nreasonable alternatives\u201d to compliance. The law does not give\ndetailed guidance on the baseline of \u201creasonable\nalternatives\u201d against which the wrongfulness of a threat might\nbe measured. The question of the baseline has attracted significant\ncommentary in the philosophical literature on coercion. Nozick (1969:\n446) offers a characterization in terms of the \u201cnormal or\nnatural or expected course of events\u201d. Others have analyzed the\nbaseline in explicitly normative terms, as a set of options that\npersons ought to have as a matter of right (Wertheimer 1987; cf.\nBerman 2002). While the paradigmatic threat (\u201cyour money or your\nlife\u201d) makes the coercee worse off relative to her baseline\nregardless of compliance, threats in commercial exchange are often\nmore subtle. An offeror might threaten to worsen the offeree\u2019s\nsituation if she refuses an offer, even if its acceptance would be\nbaseline-improving. To illustrate, if workers refuse to work under the\nterms of an existing contract unless the employer consents to a\nmodification, the employer may be under duress even if the proposed\nmodification is mutually beneficial.\n\nA precise account of when an agent lacks \u201creasonable\nalternatives\u201d might help distinguish wrongful threats from\npermissible offers, given that offers, like threats, aim to influence\nbehavior, and might be experienced by the offeree as leaving her no\noption but to accept. Several theorists have argued that\nbaseline-improving offers can be coercive. On David Zimmerman\u2019s\n(1981) view, an offer is coercive if its acceptance locks the offeree\ninto a life situation that prevents her from seeking better\nalternatives than what the offeror proposes. Joan McGregor (1988)\nsuggests shifting focus from baseline improvement to whether the\nofferor exercises power over the offeree within a relationship of\ndependence. On McGregor\u2019s analysis, an offeror exercises power\nwhen she has control over a considerable harm that might fall on the\nofferee (see also O\u2019Neill 1991; Pettit 1996). While the analysis\nmay not quite fit the law\u2019s concept of duress, it is arguably\nimplicit in the common law\u2019s unconscionability doctrine, which\npolices one-sided contracts between parties with unequal bargaining\npower. For a more detailed discussion of the distinction between\noffers and threats, see the entry on\n coercion.\n\nIn addition to threats and exploitative offers, agents may be subject\nto influences in the bargaining process that impair their ability to\ndecide rationally or based on their considered and robust desires (on\nconceptions of freedom that identify some but not all of the\nagent\u2019s desires with her will, see, e.g., Frankfurt 1973 [1988],\nYaffe 2007). A seller might take advantage of a buyer\u2019s\ninnumeracy or cognitive biases in eliciting her consent. While the law\nrecognizes a category of \u201cundue influence\u201d as grounds for\nrecission, the doctrine\u2019s application, in addition to being\nundertheorized, is usually limited to cases involving a special\nrelationship of trust. It is widely acknowledged, however, that\nrationality failures can be exploited within exchange relationships,\nand the potential for exploitation is often the basis for regulatory\nintervention. A comprehensive analysis of freedom in contract should\ntherefore clarify what forms of persuasion count as instances of\nwrongful control, a question that accounts of duress and uninformed\nconsent do not necessarily address.\n2.3 Intentionality\n\nOn the standard picture, contractual obligations are grounded in the\nparties\u2019 promissory intentions, or in such intentions as might\nreasonably be inferred from the parties\u2019 speech acts. The\nstandard picture needs a philosophy of action if modern doctrine is to\nbe convincingly justified. The demands of mass contracting mean that\ncontracts are often entered into without bespoke drafting or indeed\nany dickering at all. The law finds contractual obligations in such\nthoughtless acts as selecting \u201cI agree\u201d on a software\nlicense form without reading its terms (Rakoff 1983; Barnett 2002;\nRadin 2014). Form-drafters usually have reason to know that such\nactions are thoughtless and, also, that the average consumer is\ngenerally not in the position of being able to bargain for better\nterms. Indeed, form-drafters often arrange their contractual practices\nto make bespoke bargaining impossible, for example by having their\nforms presented electronically or by employees who are not empowered\nto modify terms. The reasonableness of imputing promissory intent in\nsuch circumstances seems questionable (Radin 2007; 2014).\n\nThe puzzle is magnified by the pervasiveness of form contracting in\nmodern markets and by the details of contract law doctrine. For\nexample, the law\u2019s treatment of standard forms as agreements is\nnot so easily dismissed as a \u201cconvenient fiction\u201d\njustified by the general need to enforce standard forms given the many\nimportant functions they serve, from allowing large organizations to\nsolve agency problems to saving the consumer costs associated with\nbargaining over low probability events (Rakoff 1983: 1220\u20131245).\nAnglo-American contract law has long recognized a category of\n\u201cas if\u201d or \u201cquasi-contracts\u201d (see, e.g.,\nBaily v. West (1969)) whose enforcement is justified on\nexceptional, non-promissory grounds. That is, the law acknowledges\ncases where promissory intent may be lacking but duties of a\ncontractual form are imposed anyway. In a paradigm case, justification\nis said to reside in hypothetical consent: an unconscious patient who\nreceives life-saving treatment from a physician without previously\nconsenting owes remunerative duties on a quasi-contractual basis\ninsofar as the patient would have consented if she could have. The law\ndoes not subsume standard forms under the category of quasi-contracts.\nOn the contrary, the law enforces standard forms as bona fide\nagreements.\n\nA natural thought is that the basis for contractual obligation may be\nfound in a vague promissory intention. Most promises leave room for\nfurther specification while still being sufficiently specific to\nproduce reasonable reliance. Sam promises to help Susan move homes but\nwithout specifying whether he intends to labor personally or pay a\nmover. Sam incurs a general duty owed to Susan that can be variously\nsatisfied. Modern contract law, moreover, is quite comfortable with\nfilling in gaps in incomplete contracts (for example, imputing a\nmarket price where no price is mentioned: UCC: \u00a7 2-204(3)) and\nrendering vague terms precise (for example, fixing the payment meant\nby an employer\u2019s promise of \u201creasonable recognition\u201d\nfor inventions made by an employee, see Corthell v. Summit Thread\nCo. (1933)). A consumer\u2019s intention in agreeing to a form\ncontract may be some underspecified form of compliance with its terms,\nwhich the law can render precise as it usually does.\n\nThe problem with this approach is that agents are usually able to\nprecisely state the contents of a vague promise when invited to do so,\nwhereas the average consumer, having never read a standard form, is\nhardly in the same position. More generally, even vague promissory\nintentions must satisfy minimal criteria for being an intention. On\nthe simplest analysis of prospective intention, to intend an action is\nto believe that one will perform it and to have an appropriate guiding\ndesire (Audi 1973, 395; cf. Harman 1976; Davis 1984). That consumers\nform beliefs about all their contractually contemplated future actions\nwhen they agree to a form contract seems questionable. On an\nalternative picture, intentions are a distinctive mental state (not\nreducible to beliefs or desires) with a unique functional role of\nguiding and controlling the agent\u2019s behavior as well as her\nreasoning (Bratman 1987: 20; see, more generally, the entry on\n intention).\n Whether the average consumer forms any such future-directed, action-\nor reasoning-guiding mental state when she agrees to a standard form\nis similarly doubtful.\n\nBarnett (2002) suggests that the puzzle is best addressed by shifting\nfrom a promissory theory of contracts to an adjacent consent-based\ntheory (Barnett 1986). While the concepts of consent and promise fall\nin the same normative family (Hurd 1996), the criteria for consent may\nbe less demanding. Nevertheless, the view confronts parallel worries,\nsince what was consented-to remains opaque. Barnett suggests that a\nconsumer\u2019s consent is limited to those terms that are not\nradically unexpected (637), but the basis for such empirical\nassumptions about consumer intent remains unclear. It is doubtful that\nthe average consumer considers the question of what, if anything, she\nis consenting to when she mindlessly clicks \u201cI agree\u201d\n(Radin 2007; 2014; Kar & Radin 2019). Ultimately, the problem is\nnot even due to standard forms including standard(or non-bespoke)\nterms or the terms being unread by the consumer. The problem stems\ndirectly from the fact that the consumer\u2019s actions in virtue of\nwhich the law finds an intention to be bound appear\nthoughtless\u2014that is, lacking in intentionality.\n\nThe point of the discussion is not to critique the orthodox view of\ncontracts as promissory (or chosen) obligation (for general\ncriticisms, see\n \u00a71.1),\n but to suggest that the standard picture needs an account of\nprospective intention. Not just any view of what an intention is fits\nboth the standard picture and modern legal practice. It may be that an\nagent\u2019s intention, in the relevant contractual sense, is\nrevealed not by her articulable beliefs or action-guiding attitudes in\nthe moment, but her unconscious dispositions. Given that most\nconsumers comply with standard forms without contesting their\nvalidity, this general fact about consumer behavior might make it\nreasonable to impute a disposition to be bound. On the other hand,\nbehavioral research suggests that people \u201care more likely to\ncomply with contracts they participated in negotiating\u201d (Eigen\n2012: 67). At the same time, a consumer\u2019s reasons for complying\nin subsequent disputes may be entirely disconnected from her original\nintentions. The view risks conflating the fact that a person\u2019s\ncompliance is predictable ex ante with the fact that she intends to\ncomply. If these and other challenges can be overcome, however, then a\ndispositional theory of contractual intention may offer a better fit\nwith orthodox contract theory and modern practice than the available\nalternatives.\n2.4 Distributive fairness and the ethics of surplus sharing\n\nContract law raises questions of distributive fairness. Should the\ndesign of legal doctrine be sensitive to its distributive effects?\nShould parties consider distributive fairness in fixing the contents\nof particular agreements? The individual and institutional questions\nare of course related. Interpersonal obligations arising out of\ncontract\u2019s internal normative structure might serve as a basis\nfor institutional design.\n\nBeginning with legal doctrine, we can distinguish rules that seem more\nconcerned with procedural aspects of justice, especially freedom and\nautonomy in the lead up to agreement, than justice in the final\ndistribution of benefits and burdens. Any number of\ndoctrines\u2014fraud, duress, and undue influence, for\nexample\u2014protect weaker parties from being deceived, coerced, or\nmanipulated into contractual obligations (see\n \u00a72.2).\n Moreover, the duty of good faith in performance, one of the few\nmandatory duties that the law imposes on every contract (UCC\n\u00a71-304; R2: \u00a7205), prevents one party from exploiting her\ncounterparty\u2019s strategic vulnerabilities (often incurred on\naccount of the contract itself) to \u201crecapture opportunities\nforgone at formation\u201d (Burton 1980: 387). This approach to good\nfaith is procedural insofar as it makes the contract\u2014the\nallocation of opportunities the parties opted into \u2014the measure\nof what good faith requires.\n\nHowever, a few contract law doctrines address distributive concerns\nmore directly. For a time, it looked as if the doctrine of\n\u201cunconscionability\u201d might inscribe substantive limits on\ncontractual inequality into consumer law, at least with respect to\nlow-income consumers (UCC: \u00a72-302). The doctrine of\nunconscionability has two components: \u201cprocedural\nunconscionability\u201d arises when one side exploits inequalities of\nbargaining sophistication or power to its advantage; and\n\u201csubstantive unconscionability\u201d arises when the terms\nstruck unreasonably, and extremely, favor one side. Traditionally,\nboth elements must be separately demonstrated to establish\nunconscionability, but for a brief period, it looked as if substantive\nunconscionability, standing alone, might allow a consumer to avoid an\nonerous contractual obligation (see, e.g., Jones v. Star Credit\nCorp., 1969). This line of doctrine was quickly narrowed (see,\ne.g., Patterson v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co., Inc., 1971).\nToday, unconscionability requires (to varying degrees in different\njurisdictions) a procedural element, so that a contract\u2019s\nsubstantive injustice is not, without more, sufficient to render it\nunenforceable. Moreover, on the conventional interpretation, the\nprocedural element requires some sort of bargaining abuse so that it\nis not enough that one contracting party is less economically\nprivileged and therefore more economically vulnerable. Other doctrines\nthat subject contractual terms to distributive scrutiny similarly\nemphasize procedural and transactional aspects of justice. The\ndoctrine of contra proferentum, for example, calls for\ncontracts to be interpreted against their drafters. And any number of\nprovisions in the UCC authorize courts to fill contractual gaps,\ninterpret ambiguous terms, or regulate renegotiation, with courts\noften exercising their discretion in ways that favor unsophisticated\n(and often poorer) parties (Rakoff 2016). For this reason, although\nthe application of doctrines like unconscionability might be driven by\nconsiderations of distributive justice, the law does not make\ndistributive justice a freestanding criterion for the enforceability\nof contracts. An argument might be made that the law embodies an\nAristotelian conception of commutative justice (Gordley\n1991), so that contractual exchange must deploy a \u201cjust\nprice,\u201d which allows neither party to enrich itself at the\nexpense of the other; but an analogous claim that the law exemplifies\na general concern for social and income inequality would be hard to\nmaintain.\n\nSeveral theorists have favored broadening the egalitarian doctrines of\ncontract law. On one proposal, forms of advantage-taking in\ncontractual exchange through non-disclosure of information should be\ntolerated only to the extent that permissive rules confer long-term\nbenefits on those who are most vulnerable (Kronman 1980). The proposal\ndraws support from a prioritarian principle of weighted beneficence,\naccording to which benefits to the worse off have greater moral\nweight. Along similar lines, Aditi Bagchi (2014) argues that ambiguous\nterms in contracts should be interpreted in ways that promote\ndistributive justice by benefiting the economically worse off. The law\nof contracts thus becomes a tool for improving the unequal background\nconditions in which exchange occurs, conditions that undermine the\nvalidity and authenticity of people\u2019s choices, and, relatedly,\nthe moral basis for enforcing contracts in the first place (Ackerman\n1983; Kennedy 1982).\n\nContract law egalitarianism draws support from an extensive literature\nin moral and political philosophy that has questioned the legitimacy\nof exchange relations in unequal societies. John Rawls\u2019 seminal\nwork has been especially influential. Rawls (2005: 266\u2013267)\nobserves that the free market allows everyone to gain through private\nexchange, but it also allows those who are already more advantaged to\ncapture as much of the contractual surplus as they are able to, so\nthat \u201cthe invisible hand guides things in the wrong direction\n\u2026 maintaining unjustified inequalities and restrictions on fair\nopportunity.\u201d\n\n\nContract and property law, together with institutions of\ntax-and-transfer, arguably fall within the \u201cbasic\nstructure\u201d of society\u2014that is, the category of\ninstitutions that so pervasively influence people\u2019s lives as to\ndemand special justification (Murphy 1998: 260\u2013261). For Rawls,\nthe basic structure\u2019s justification depends on what parties\nwould rationally agree to ignorant of various aspects of their\nsituation, including their economic circumstances. Rawlsian\n\u201cmaximin principles\u201d prioritize the interests of those who\nare worse off. While a full analysis of Rawls\u2019 work and its\ninfluence on modern contract theory is beyond the scope of this entry,\nreaders can see related entries (on\n distributive justice\n and the\n original position)\n for more detail.\n\nRawlsians are hardly alone in questioning the legitimacy of private\nexchange in circumstances of inequality. Marx (Das Kapital,\n3:339\u201340) famously questions the alleged \u201cnatural\njustice\u201d of private exchange and the juristic treatment of\neconomic transactions \u201cas willful acts of the parties\nconcerned\u201d, viewing exchange relations in capitalist societies\nas invariably exploitative (see discussion in Arneson 1981: 205; cf.\nCohen 1995). Exploitation raises questions of meaningful consent and\ncoercion, some of which were discussed earlier (see\n \u00a72.2).\n But implicit in Marx\u2019s concept of exploitation (assuming the\nview to be less than fully skeptical of considerations of justice) is\na distinct moral notion: the failure of private exchange to ensure\nparties receive as much as they deserve based on their productive\ncontributions and sacrifices (cf. Cohen 1995: 116\u2013117; on moral\ndesert, see below).\n\nContract law egalitarianism at the institutional level confronts two\nstandard criticisms. First, it is not obvious that judges have the\nauthority or competence to promote distributive justice. A\ntax-and-benefit scheme may be a more effective means of promoting the\ninterests of the economically worse off than private law, though\nwhether this is true remains an open empirical question (Kaplow &\nShavell 1994; Lucy 2007: 352\u20136; Liscow 2021 [Other Internet\nResources]). Second, contract disputes are private affairs, and people\ndeserve protection from being singled out to bear the burdens\nassociated with the collective\u2019s moral responsibilities. Thomas\nNagel (1991: ch9) describes a division of moral labor between, on the\none hand, institutional actors responsible for the basic legal\nstructure, and, on the other, ordinary citizens acting in their\nprivate capacity. In general, persons may lead better lives if freed\nfrom the obligation to manage their exchange relations\naltruistically. The point seems consistent, however, with courts being\nobliged to enforce negative duties\u2014for instance, a duty not to\ntake advantage of the collective\u2019s failure to secure\ndistributive justice (Murphy 1998: 266; Bagchi 2014). The common\nlaw\u2019s unconscionability doctrine appears tailor-made to police\nthis kind of predation by the economically privileged of the\ndisadvantaged.\n\nWe turn from the institutional-level question to the question of what\ncontracting parties individually owe one another. Contracts generate\nsurplus from cooperation\u2014each side typically stands to benefit\nthrough exchange. How that surplus ought to be divided is not\nnecessarily settled by assuming that the parties transact from a place\nof equality. Robert Nozick\u2019s (1974) famous discussion of\n\u201cjustice in transfer\u201d provides a convenient starting point\nfor exploring the ethics of surplus sharing. Nozick suggests that\ninequalities arising out of voluntary transactions do not give rise to\na question of justice, given fair background conditions. On\nNozick\u2019s \u201cvoluntarist\u201d view, whatever sharing scheme\nis voluntarily agreed to (setting aside stealing, fraud, etc.) is\njust, or, alternatively, no question of justice is raised by a\ndivision the parties consented to (for a more detailed statement, see\nNozick 1974: 149\u2013182). There are other more qualified strains of\nvoluntarism. A \u201csufficientarian\u201d might insist that the\nconsented-to division must satisfy a minimal baseline. Sterba (1986:\n8) articulates a \u201cNeeds and Agreement Principle\u201d under\nwhich the results of voluntary agreement and private appropriation are\nmorally justified only insofar as each person is guaranteed the goods\nnecessary to meet the normal costs of satisfying her basic needs.\nSufficientarian constraints might entail, for example, that those\ninvolved in the provision of essential goods or services\u2014basic\nmedicine or education\u2014owe more robust duties to those with whom\nthey contract.\n\nMoving further away from pure voluntarism, a prominent approach\ndistinguishes between deserved and undeserved shares of cooperative\nsurplus. Nozick is sometimes criticized for assuming that persons are\nentitled to that portion of the market price for their goods and\nservices characterizable as \u201cscarcity rent\u201d (B. Fried\n1995: 230). Rent is defined as a gain that exceeds what is necessary\nto incentivize cooperative exchange. Excess gains in market exchange\nare often attributable to natural scarcity, including scarcity of\nnatural talents. Whether persons deserve such windfalls flowing from\nbrute luck in the birth lottery remains a deeply contested moral\nquestion. Some find a desert-basis in effort and other forms of\npersonal sacrifice, including delayed gratification (as in investment\ncontracts). On this view, parties are owed at least as much of the\nsurplus from a cooperative scheme as would constitute fair\ncompensation for their sacrifices (Reiman 1983; Sadurski 1985; Milne\n1986). Others finds a desert-basis in productive contribution. Parties\nto contractual exchange deserve fair remuneration for their marginal\nproduct (D. Miller 1976; Miller 1999; J. Riley 1989). Marginal product\nis defined as a factor\u2019s distinctive contribution to raising the\nvalue of goods and services, holding other factors constant. The\ncentral moral intuition, here, is that people ought to receive\nbenefits from exchange in proportion to how much they improve the\nwellbeing of others (Lamont 1994). The productive contribution theory\nis sometimes motivated on general consequentialist grounds (rather\nthan notions of moral desert), with rents explained as the premium\nnecessary for incentivizing parties to put their talents to productive\nand wellbeing-maximizing use (Arnold 1987).\n\nBoth the effort and productive contribution theories rely on concepts\nthat invite further specification. Consider the concept of marginal\nproduct. What is produced by one\u2019s efforts depends on the\nproductivity of the tools and raw materials one has at one\u2019s\ndisposal. The state is a contributing participant, also, in every\ncooperative exchange (B. Fried 1995). Given that many people make\ninterdependent contributions to social product, the link between any\nindividual\u2019s labor and output seems too attenuated to ground\nanything more determinate than the claim that people deserve\nsomething based on what they produce (Scanlon 2018: ch8). And\nit is hard to see how so general a normative claim could bear the\nweight of justifying any precise proposal for surplus division.\n\nGauthier (1986: 140\u2013141, 152\u2013153) suggests that\ncooperative surplus might be split according to the ratio of the\nparties\u2019 \u201cindividual relative benefit from\ncooperation\u201d. Each party\u2019s relative benefit from exchange\nis measured by their next best option. If A and B\ngenerate $10 of cooperative surplus, and A could have earned\n$3 acting independently of B, while B could have\nearned $4, then the maximum A can claim of the surplus is $6\nconsistent with inducing B\u2019s willing cooperation, and\nthe maximum B can claim is $7 for a parallel reason. When the\n$10 surplus is split based on a 6:7 ratio, each party receives such\nbenefits as she would expect apart from cooperation and, in addition,\nreceives a share of the surplus proportionate to her potential for\nbenefiting from the exchange. Gauthier defends the proposal as a\nsolution to a bargaining problem confronting self-interested rational\nagents, but it is morally contestable. It remains unclear why a party\nshould receive more just because they had a better alternative, since\nthe availability of an attractive alternative may be a function of\nbrute luck. Moreover, Gauthier\u2019s principle does not guarantee\nthat parties receive a share commensurate to sacrifice or productive\ncontribution (Van Parijs 1996).\n\nThe proposals considered so far invoke considerations of\npre-institutional morality and/or rationality. But the ethics of\nsurplus sharing might instead be traced to established customs.\nMacneil (1986) suggests that markets give rise to complex norms of\n\u201cgift-giving\u201d in commercial exchange. These gift-giving\nnorms encourage agents to refrain from claiming as much of the surplus\nas possible and have an important role to play in maintaining social\nbonds, especially in contexts where constant haggling undermines trust\nand creates impediments to contracting. For example, sellers of\nantiques will offer discounts to those who reveal their enthusiastic\ninterest in purchasing an item. By rewarding disclosures against\nself-interest, the sellers promote solidarity and cooperation in the\nmarket for antiques. Macneil observes that norms of gift-giving are\nmore likely to emerge where the cooperative surplus is large and\nrepeat interaction generates high interdependence.\n\nA question facing the social solidarity view is why market\nparticipants should feel obliged to comply with customary norms.\nCustom is sometimes portrayed \u201cas the embodiment of what parties\nin the relevant community actually, not fictitiously, consent to when\nthey manifest their intention to be legally bound\u201d (Barnett\n1992: 1192).\n\n\nOn this view, the parties\u2019 expectations become the grounds for\ncomplying with the relevant surplus sharing norms, although\nexpectations, even ones based on longstanding customs, are not always\nreasonable or fair. Another possibility is that the reasons for\ncompliance may be grounded in general, consequentialist considerations\nconcerning the importance of reinforcing socially beneficial customs.\nA third is that compliance produces additional surplus by lowering\ntransaction costs.\n\nIn the final analysis, a broad range of distributive considerations\narguably ought to shape bargaining behavior, and the above discussion\nis not intended to be exhaustive. As should be apparent from the lack\nof convergence among theorists, the moral question of justice in\ntransfer that is at the heart of contract remains far from\nsettled.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Articles and Books", "Legal sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Articles and Books": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Ackerman, Bruce, 1983, <em>Social Justice in the Liberal\nState</em>, New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.", "Alces, Peter A., 2008, \u201cUnintelligent Design in\nContract\u201d, <em>University of Illinois Law Review</em>, 2008(2):\n505\u2013554.\n [<a href=\"https://scholarship.law.wm.edu/facpubs/8\" target=\"other\">Alces 2008 available online</a>]", "Arneson, Richard J., 1981, \u201cWhat\u2019s Wrong with\nExploitation?\u201d, <em>Ethics</em>, 91(2): 202\u2013227.\ndoi:10.1086/292224", "Arnold, N.
