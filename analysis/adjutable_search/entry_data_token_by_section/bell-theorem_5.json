    "main_text": "Some Variants of Bell\u2019s Theorem\n6. Some Variants of Bell\u2019s Theorem\n\nThis section will discuss in some detail two variants of Bell\u2019s\nTheorem which depart in some respect from the conceptual framework\npresented in\n Section 2.\n Both are less general than the version in\n Section 2,\n because they rely on perfect correlations, which, together with the\nfactorizability condition (F), entail outcome determinism (OD). At the\nend of the section two other variants will be mentioned briefly but\nnot summarized in detail.\n\nThe first variant is due independently to\n Kochen,[8]\n Stairs (1978, 1983), and Heywood and Redhead (1983). Its ensemble of\ninterest consists of pairs of spin-1 particles in the entangled\nstate\n\n\\[\\tag{27}\n\\ket{\\Phi} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\left[ \\ket{z,1}_1 \\ket{z,-1}_2 - \\ket{z,0}_1 \\ket{z,0}_2 + \\ket{z,-1}_1 \\ket{z,1}_2 \\right],\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\ket{z,i}_1\\), with \\(i = -1\\) or 0 or 1 is the spin state of\nparticle 1 with component of spin \\(i\\) along the axis \\(z\\), and\n\\(\\ket{z,i}_2\\) has an analogous meaning for particle 2. If \\(x,y,z\\)\nis a triple of orthogonal axes in 3-space then the components \\(s_x,\ns_y, s_z\\) of the spin operator along these axes do not pairwise\ncommute. However, the squares of these operators \u2014 \\(s_x^2,\ns_y^2, s_z^2\\) \u2014 do commute, and therefore, in view of the\nconsiderations of\n Section 1,\n any two of them can constitute a context in the measurement of the\nthird. If the operator of interest is\n\\(s_z^2\\), the axes \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\) can be any pair of orthogonal axes in the plane\nperpendicular to \\(z\\), thus offering an infinite family of\ncontexts for the measurement of\n\\(s_{z}^2\\). As noted in\n Section 1\n Bell exhibited the possibility of a contextual hidden\nvariables theory for a quantum system whose Hilbert space has\ndimension 3 or greater even though the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem\nshowed the impossibility of a non-contextual hidden variables\ntheory for such a system. The strategy of the argument is to use the\nentangled state of Eq. (27) to predict the outcome of measuring\n\\(s_{z}^2\\) for particle 2 (for any choice of \\(z)\\) by measuring its\ncounterpart on particle 1. A specific complete state \\(\\lambda\\) would\ndetermine whether \\(s_{z}^2\\) of 1, measured together with a context\nin 1, is 0 or 1. Agreement with the quantum mechanical prediction of\nthe entangled state of Eq. (27) implies that \\(s_z^2\\) of 2 has the\nsame value 0 or 1. But if the factorizability condition (F) is\nassumed, then the result of measuring \\(s_{z}^2\\) on 2 must be\nindependent of the remote context, that is, independent of the choice\nof \\(s_{x}^2\\) and \\(s_y^2\\) of 1, hence of 2 because of correlation,\nfor any pair of orthogonal directions \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in the plane\nperpendicular to \\(z\\). It follows that the hypothetical theory which\nsupplies the complete state \\(\\lambda\\) is not contextual after all,\nbut maps the set of operators \\(s_z^2\\) of 2, for any direction\n\\(z\\), noncontextually into the pair of values (0, 1). But\nthat is impossible in view of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem. The\nconclusion is that no theory satisfying the factorizability condition\n(F) is consistent with the quantum mechanical predictions of the\nentangled state (29).\n\nA simpler proof of Bell\u2019s Theorem, also relying upon\ncounterfactual reasoning and based upon a deterministic local theory,\nis that of Hardy (1993), here presented in Lalo\u00eb\u2019s (2001)\nformulation. Consider an ensemble of pairs 1 and 2 of\nspin\\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) particles, the spin of 1 measured along\ndirections in the \\(xz\\)-plane making angles \\(a=\\theta /2\\) and\n\\(a'=0\\) with the \\(z\\)-axis, and angles \\(b\\) and \\(b'\\) having\nanalogous significance for 2. The quantum states for particle 1 with\nspins \\(+\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) relative to direction\n\\(a'\\) are respectively \\(\\ket{a',+}_1\\) and \\(\\ket{a',-}_1\\), and\nrelative to direction \\(a\\) are respectively\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{28a} \\ket{a,+}_1 &= \\cos\\theta \\ket{a',+}_1 + \\sin\\theta \\ket{a',-}_1 \\\\\n\\tag{28b} \\ket{a,-}_1 &= -\\sin\\theta \\ket{a',+}_1 + \\cos\\theta \\ket{a',-}_1; \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nthe spin states for 2 are analogous. The ensemble of interest is\nprepared in the entangled quantum state\n\n\\[\\tag{29}\n\\ket{\\Psi} = {-\\cos \\theta \\ket{a',+}_1 \\ket{b',-}_2} -{\\cos\\theta \\ket{a',-}_1 \\ket{b',+}_2} + \n  {\\sin\\theta \\ket{a',+}_1 \\ket{b',+}_2}\n\\]\n\n\n(unnormalized, because normalization is not needed for the following\nargument). Then for the specified \\(a, a',\nb\\), and \\(b'\\) the following quantum mechanical\npredictions hold:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{30} \\langle \\Psi \\mid a,+\\rangle_1 \\ket{b',+}_2 = 0; \\\\\n\\tag{31} \\langle \\Psi \\mid a',+\\rangle_1 \\ket{b,+}_2 = 0; \\\\\n\\tag{32} \\langle \\Psi \\mid a',-\\rangle_1 \\ket{b',-}_2 = 0;\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nand for almost all values of the \\(\\theta\\) of Eq. (31)\n\n\\[\\tag{33}\n\\langle \\Psi \\mid a,+\\rangle_1 \\ket{b,+}_2 \\ne 0,\n\\]\n\n\nwith the maximum occurring around \\(\\theta = 9\\degr\\). Inequality\n(33) asserts that for the specified angles there is a non-empty\nsubensemble \\(E'\\) of pairs for which the results for a\nspin measurement along \\(a\\) for 1 and along \\(b\\) for 2 are\nboth +. Eq. (30) implies the counterfactual proposition that if the\nspin of a 2 in \\(E'\\) had been measured along\n\\(b'\\) then with certainty the result would have been\n\\(-\\); and likewise Eq. (31) implies the counterfactual proposition\nthat if the spin of a 1 in \\(E'\\) had been measured along\n\\(a'\\) then with certainty the result would have been\n\\(-\\). It is in this step that counterfactual reasoning is used in\nthe argument. Since the subensemble \\(E'\\) is non-empty, we\nhave reached a contradiction with Eq. (32), which asserts that if the\nspin of 1 is measured along \\(a'\\) and that of 2 is\nmeasured along \\(b'\\) then it is impossible that both\nresults are \\(-\\). The incompatibility of a deterministic local\ntheory with quantum mechanics is thereby demonstrated.\n\nAn attempt was made by Stapp (1997) to demonstrate a strengthened\nversion of Bell\u2019s theorem which dispenses with the conceptual\nframework outlined above, and to use instead the logic of\ncounterfactual conditionals. His intricate argument has been the\nsubject of a criticism by Shimony and Stein (2001, 2003), who are\ncritical of certain counterfactual conditionals that are asserted by\nStapp by means of a \u201cpossible worlds\u201d analysis without a\ngrounding on a local deterministic theory, and a response by Stapp (2001)\nhimself, who defends his argument with some modifications.\n\nThe three variants of Bell\u2019s Theorem considered so far in this\nsection concern ensembles of pairs of particles. An entirely new\ndomain of variants is opened by studying ensembles of\n\\(n\\)-tuples of particles with \\(n \\ge 3\\). The prototype\nof this kind of theorem was demonstrated by Greenberger, Horne, and\nZeilinger (1989) (GHZ) for \\(n=4\\) and modified to \\(n=3\\)\nby Mermin (1990) and by Greenberger, Horne, Shimony, and Zeilinger\n(1990) (GHSZ). In the theorem of GHZ an entangled quantum state was\nwritten for four spin-\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) particles and the expectation value of\nthe product of certain binary measurements performed on the individual\nparticles was calculated. They then showed that the attempt to\nduplicate this expectation value subject to the factorizability\nconstraint (F) produces a contradiction. A similar result was obtained\nby Mermin for a state of 3 spin-\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) particles and by GHSZ for a\nstate of 3 photons entangled with respect to their direction of\npropagation. Because of the length of these arguments and limitations\nof space in the present article the details will not be summarized\nhere, it is however worth mentioning that experimental tests were\nrealized (Pan et al. 2000, Genovese 2005) (also in this case\nwith additional hypotheses).\n",
