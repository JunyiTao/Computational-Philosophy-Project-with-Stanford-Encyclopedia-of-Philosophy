The ethicist of belief will\nthus need to specify the type of value she is invoking, why and how\nshe thinks it can ground doxastic norms, whether it is the only kind\nof value that does that, and (if not) what the priority relations are\nbetween norms based in different kinds of value. \n\nClifford and Locke, as we have seen, claim that the issue of whether\nwe have done our doxastic best is an epistemic one and also\n(given a few further premises) a moral one. James, on the\nother hand, focuses on the important role played by\nprudential value in the ethics of belief, saying in one\npassage that Clifford's Principle not only puts us at \u201crisk of\nlosing the truth\u201d and thus of violating an epistemic norm, but\nthat it articulates an \u201cinsane logic\u201d\u2014an\n\u201cabsurdity\u201d that guarantees prudential disaster (1896,\n25). The general idea is that if something is beneficial, and\nbelieving that p will help us achieve, acquire, or actualize\nthat thing, then it is prima facie prudent for us to believe\nthat p. This will be true even if we lack sufficient evidence\nfor the belief that p, and even if we are aware of that\nlack.\n\nConsider for example someone who reads in the psychological literature\nthat people are much more likely to survive a cancer diagnosis if they\nfirmly believe that they will survive it. Upon being diagnosed with\nthe disease himself, and in light of the fact that his goal is to\nsurvive, it will be prudent for this person to believe that he will\nsurvive, even if he knows that he (and his doctors) lack sufficient\nevidence for that belief. James refers to such cases as ones\n\u201cwhere faith in a fact can help create the fact\u201d (1896,\n25).\n\nSomeone might suggest that the patient's knowledge that his\n\u201cfaith helps create the fact\u201d itself counts as a\nkind of evidence in its favor. If this is right, then the case would\nnot be in tension with Clifford's Principle after all. But other cases\ncan be used to make the same point: Pascal famously argues that it is\nrequired by prudential rationality that we believe in God,\neven though we lack sufficient evidence for that belief, and even\nthough such belief would play no role in \u201ccreating\u201d the\nfact that it describes (Pascal 1670).\n\nHere\u2019s a non-religious example: suppose that you would like to\nretain a good relationship with your teenage son, and you are aware\nthat this requires believing the best of him whenever possible. You\nalso have some moderate but not compelling olfactory evidence that he\nis using drugs in the house when you are away (in response to your\nqueries, he claims that he has recently taken up transcendental\nmeditation, and that the funny smell when you come home is just\nincense). Suppose too that you know yourself well enough to know that\nyour relationship with your son will be seriously damaged if you come\nto view him as a habitual drug-user. This suggests that you would\nviolate a prudential norm if you go ahead and believe that he is. In\nother words, it is prudent, given your ends, to withhold belief about\nthe source of the aroma altogether, or even to believe, if possible,\nthat he is not smoking pot but rather burning incense in your absence.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if you regard the occasional use of recreational\ndrugs as harmless fun that expresses a healthy contempt for\noverweening state authority (in some states, at least), then it might\nbe prudent for you\u2014confronted with the telltale odor\u2014to\nform the belief that your son has indeed taken up the habit in\nquestion. Either way, the recommendation here aims at a kind of\nprudential or pragmatic value, and not at the truth per se.\n(For some recent arguments in favor of prudential evidence for belief,\nsee Reisner 2008 and 2009; for arguments against, see Adler 2002 and\nShah 2006). \n",
