    "main_text": "Logic\n3. Logic\n\n\nAlbert carefully prepared a paraphrase of Aristotle\u2019s\nOrganon (the logical treatises in the Aristotelian corpus). He\nthen used the results of this paraphrase to address the problem of\nuniversals as he found it discussed in the philosophical literature and\ndebates of the medieval philosophical culture. He defined the term\nuniversal as referring to \u201c \u2026 that which, although it\n exists in one, is apt by nature to exist in\n many.\u201d[1]\n Because it is apt\nto be in many, it is predicable of them. (De praed., tract II,\nc. 1) He then distinguished three kinds of universals, those that\npre-exist the things that exemplify them \n(universale ante rem), \nthose that exist in individual things (universale in re), \nand those that exist in the mind when abstracted from individual things \n(universale post rem).\n\n\nAlbert attempted to formulate an answer to Porphyry\u2019s famous problem\nof universals\u2014namely, do the species according to which we\nclassify beings exist in themselves or are they merely constructions\nof the mind? Albert appealed to his three-fold distinction, noting\nthat a universal\u2019s mode of being is differentiated according to which\nfunction is being considered. It may be considered in itself, or in\n respect to understanding, or as existing in one particular or\n another.[2]\n Both the nominalist and realist solutions to Porphyry\u2019s problem are\nthus too simplistic and lack proper distinction. Albert\u2019s distinction\nthus allowed him to harmonize Plato\u2019s realism in which universals\nexisted as separate forms with Aristotle\u2019s more nominalistic theory of\nimmanent forms. For universals when considered in themselves\n(secudum quod in seipso) truly exist and are free from\n generation, corruption, and\n change.[3]\n If, however, they are taken in reference to the mind (refertur ad\nintelligentiam) they exist in two modes, depending on whether\nthey are considered with respect to the intellect that is their cause\n or the intellect that knows them by\n abstraction.[4]\n But when they are considered in particulars (secundum quod est in\nisto vel in illo) their existence is exterior to as well as\n beyond the mind, yet existing in things as\n individuated.[5]\n",
