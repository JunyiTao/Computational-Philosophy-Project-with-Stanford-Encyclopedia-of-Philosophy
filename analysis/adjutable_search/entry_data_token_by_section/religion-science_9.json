    "main_text": "Science and religion in various religions || Judaism\n2.5 Judaism\n\nJudaism is one of the three major Abrahamic monotheistic traditions,\nencompassing a range of beliefs and practices that express a covenant\nbetween God and the people of Israel. Central to both Jewish practice\nand beliefs is the study of texts, including the written Torah (the\nTanakh, sometimes called \u201cHebrew Bible\u201d), and the\n\u201cOral Law\u201d of Rabbinic Judaism, compiled in such works\nlike the Talmud. There is also a corpus of esoteric, mystical\ninterpretations of biblical texts, the Kabbalah, which has influenced\nJewish works on the relationship between science and religion. The\nKabbalah also had an influence on Renaissance and early modern\nChristian authors such as Pico Della Mirandola, whose work helped to\nshape the scientific revolution (see the entry on\n Giovanni Pico della Mirandola).\n The theologian Maimonides (Rabbi Moshe ben-Maimon, 1138\u20131204,\naka Rambam) had an enduring influence on Jewish thought up until\ntoday, also in the science and religion literature.\n\nMost contemporary strains of Judaism are Rabbinic, rather than\nbiblical, and this has profound implications for the relationship\nbetween religion and science. While both Jews and Evangelical\nChristians emphasize the reading of sacred texts, the Rabbinic\ntraditions (unlike, for example, the Evangelical Christian tradition)\nholds that reading and interpreting texts is far from straightforward.\nScripture should not be read in a simple literal fashion. This opens\nup more space for accepting scientific theories (e.g., Big Bang\ncosmology) that seem at odds with a simple literal reading of the\nTorah (e.g., the six-day creation in Genesis) (Mitelman 2011\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n Moreover, most non-Orthodox Jews in the US identify as politically\nliberal, so openness to science may also be an identity marker given\nthat politically liberal people in the US have positive attitudes\ntoward science (Pew Forum, 2021\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n\nJewish thinkers have made substantive theoretical contributions to the\nrelationship between science and religion, which differ in interesting\nrespects from those seen in the literature written by Christian\nauthors. To give just a few examples, Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131918),\na prominent neo-Kantian German Jewish philosopher, thought of the\nrelationship between Judaism and science in the light of the advances\nin scientific disciplines and the increased participation of Jewish\nscholars in the sciences. He argued that science, ethics, and Judaism\nshould all be conceived of as distinct but complementary sciences.\nCohen believed that his Jewish religious community was facing an\nepistemic crisis. All references to God had become suspect due to an\nadherence to naturalism, at first epistemological, but fast becoming\nontological. Cohen saw the concept of a transcendent God as\nfoundational to both Jewish practice and belief, so he thought\nadherence to wholesale naturalism threatened both Jewish orthodoxy and\northopraxy. As Teri Merrick (2020) argues, Cohen suspected this was in\npart due to epistemic oppression and self-censuring (though Cohen did\nnot frame it in these terms). Because Jewish scientists wanted to\nretain credibility in the Christian majority culture, they underplayed\nand neglected the rich Jewish intellectual legacy in their practice.\nIn response to this intellectual crisis, Cohen proposed to reframe\nJewish thought and philosophy so that it would be recognized as both\ncontinuous with the tradition and essentially contributing to ethical\nand scientific advances. In this way, he reframed this tradition,\narticulating a broadly Kantian philosophy of science to combat a\nperceived conflict between Judaism and science (see the entry on\n Hermann Cohen\n for an in-depth discussion).\n\nJewish religious scholars have examined how science might influence\nreligious beliefs, and vice versa. Rather than a unified response we\nsee a spectrum of philosophical views, especially since the nineteenth\nand early twentieth century. As Shai Cherry (2003) surveys, Jewish\nscholars in the early twentieth century accepted biological evolution\nbut were hesitant about Darwinian natural selection as the mechanism.\nThe Latvian-born Israeli rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook (1865\u20131935)\nthought that religion and science are largely separate domains (a view\nsomewhat similar to Gould\u2019s NOMA), though he believed that there\nwas a possible flow from religion to science. For example, Kook\nchallenged the lack of directionality in Darwinian evolutionary\ntheory. Using readings of the Kabbalah (and Halakhah, Jewish law), he\nproposed that biological evolution fits in a larger picture of cosmic\nevolution towards perfection.\n\nBy contrast, the American rabbi Morcedai Kaplan (1881\u20131983)\nthought information flow between science and religion could go in both\ndirections, a view reminiscent to Barbour\u2019s dialogue position.\nHe repeatedly argued against scientism (the encroachment of science on\ntoo many aspects of human life, including ethics and religion), but he\nbelieved nevertheless we ought to apply scientific methods to\nreligion. He saw reality as an unfolding process without a\npre-ordained goal: it was progressive, but not teleologically\ndetermined. Kaplan emphasized the importance of morality (and\nidentified God as the source of this process), and conceptualized\nhumanity as not merely a passive recipient of evolutionary change, but\nan active participant, prefiguring work in evolutionary biology on the\nimportance of agency in evolution (e.g., Okasha 2018). Thus,\nKaplan\u2019s reception of scientific theories, especially evolution,\nled him to formulate an early Jewish process theology.\n\nReform Judaism endorses an explicit anti-conflict view on the\nrelationship between science and religion. For example, the Pittsburgh\nPlatform of 1885, the first document of the Reform rabbinate, has a\nstatement that explicitly says that science and Judaism are not in\nconflict: \n\n\nWe hold that the modern discoveries of scientific researches in the\ndomain of nature and history are not antagonistic to the doctrines of\nJudaism. \n\n\nThis Platform had an enduring influence on Reform Judaism over the\nnext decades. Secular Jewish scientists such as Albert Einstein,\nRichard Feynman, Douglas Daniel Kahneman, and Stephen J. Gould have\nalso reflected on the relationship between science and broader issues\nof existential significance, and have exerted considerable influence\non the science and religion debate.\n",
