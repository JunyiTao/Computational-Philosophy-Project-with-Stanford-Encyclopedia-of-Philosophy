Alongside the issues raised by mainstream ethical\nanalysis, feminist bioethicists have noted the potential exploitation\nof women as providers of eggs (and therefore mitochondria) for\nresearch and treatment, just as they have for the global economy of\nother reproductive tissues (Baylis 2013; Dickenson 2013). Similar\nconcerns are raised about the fact that research into emerging\nreproductive technologies, such as genome editing and epigenetics, and\nany treatments to which such research ultimately leads, have a much\ngreater impact on women than on men (Scott 2022). The development of\nuterus transplants for infertility raises important moral questions\nabout the safety and efficacy of an experimental technique that\naffects only women (Flynn & Ramji 2019; Lotz 2021). Meanwhile,\nauthors such as Ruby Catsanos and colleagues (2013) highlight the\noften neglected point that the development of uterus transplantation,\nas of many other reproductive technologies, inevitably uses\nwomen\u2019s bodies as means to the end of perfecting the\nprocedure.\n\nA growing number of bioethicists are now publishing on what are\nbroadly referred to as data ethics, digital ethics, or AI ethics. All\nareas of healthcare are rapidly adopting a variety of technologies\nthat make use of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML),\nand/or some form of automated decision-making. The technologies are\npromoted on the basis that they are faster, more accurate, and bring\ngreater consistency and objectivity to medical practices and services,\nas well as possibly offering more cost-effective ways to provide these\nservices to remote or under-resourced areas, thereby increasing global\nequality. AI applications in healthcare include those that\nspecifically target women\u2019s health, such as AI systems that\nanalyze radiological imagery in diagnosing breast and cervical cancer\nor predict disease progression from clinical data. Meanwhile a growing\nmarket of direct to consumer AI-based products and apps claim to\nempower users, such as pregnant women, through the provision of health\ninformation (Gross et al. 2021; Paton 2022). These claims have been\nchallenged by some feminist bioethicists who see instead just another\ninstance of the control and surveillance of women\u2019s bodies.\n\nFurthermore there are serious concerns about the overhyping of AI on\nthe basis of poor quality data, shaky evidence, and oversimplification\nof the real-life settings in which AI-powered devices will be applied\n(Wang et al. 2019; Carter et al. 2020). More specifically of interest\nto a feminist critique, against the claims that computer-driven\nprocesses are better and fairer because they are\n\u201cuncontaminated\u201d by human fallibilities, it is becoming\nclear that AI has a tendency to build existing injustices into novel\ndigital systems (D\u2019Ignazio & Klein 2020; Wellner &\nRothman 2020). This may be due to the biased nature of the data on\nwhich systems are trained. One obvious way in which this can happen is\nif AI healthcare technologies use data derived largely or exclusively\nfrom men (Larrazabal et al. 2020). Health data are heavily affected by\nlong-standing social, cultural, and institutional biases, which means\nthat algorithms based on these data will perpetuate or even exacerbate\nexisting gender and health disparities\u2014for example, the lack of\ndata on women\u2019s physiology inevitably means that AI-based\npredictions of pharmaceutical side effects are potentially very\ninaccurate. The problem may also lie with the algorithm itself (i.e.,\nthe data may be adequate but what the algorithm does with the data is\nnot), or more fundamentally, it might flow from the social or\npolitical assumptions around which the entire process has been\nconstructed, such as beliefs about the lifestyles and behavior of the\nwomen taking a particular medication (Ho 2022).\n\nFeminist critics have long pointed out that for any technology, the\nspecifically gendered distribution of practices and obligations can\nturn what appears to be superficially beneficial into something more\nambiguous. For example, the expansion of AI health monitoring in the\nhome has been presented as means of reducing the burden on caregivers\n(who are often women) and enhancing the autonomy of disabled or older\npeople. Nevertheless, the expectation that family members will adopt\nAI-supported care may simply set up new burdens of cost or complexity\nin the management of care, place emotional or other pressures on\nfamily members (for example, if employers expect their employees to\nput surveillance in place instead of offering flexible working hours),\nand disrupt familial care relationships (Entwistle et al. 2014; Ho\n2019).\n\nFrom a feminist perspective, creating a genuinely ethical AI requires\nthinking beyond the issues of a particular technological application\nor abstract notions of \u201calgorithmic fairness\u201d, in order to\ntake into account the context within which AI is being developed and\ndeployed in real-life healthcare. A global contextualization should\nalso ensure that AI healthcare solutions do not draw data solely from,\nor use algorithms designed to focus on, the concerns of richer and\nmore powerful sectors of the community, neglecting the needs of poorer\nsectors and exacerbating health disparities.\n",
