    "main_text": "Types of Arguments || Analogy\n2.4 Analogy\n\nArguments by analogy are based on the idea that, if two things are\nsimilar, what is true of one of them is likely to be true of the other\nas well (see entry on\n analogy and analogical reasoning).\n Analogical arguments are widely used across different domains of\nhuman activity, for example in legal contexts (see entry on\n precedent and analogy in legal reasoning).\n As an example, take an argument for the wrongness of farming\nnon-human animals for food consumption: if an alien species farmed\nhumans for food, that would be wrong; so, by analogy, it is wrong for\nus humans to farm non-human animals for food. The general idea is\ncaptured in the following schema (adapted from the entry on\n analogy and analogical reasoning;\n S is the source domain and T the target domain of the\nanalogy):\n\n S is similar to T in certain (known) respects.\n S has some further feature Q.\n Therefore, T also has the feature Q, or some\nfeature Q* similar to Q.\n\n\nThe first premise establishes the analogy between two situations,\nobjects, phenomena etc. The second premise states that the source\ndomain has a given property. The conclusion is then that the target\ndomain also has this property, or a suitable counterpart thereof.\nWhile informative, this schema does not differentiate between good and\nbad analogical arguments, and so does not offer much by way of\nexplaining what grounds (good) analogical arguments. Indeed,\ncontentious cases usually pertain to premise 1, and in particular to\nwhether S and T are sufficiently similar in a way that\nis relevant for having or not having feature Q.\n\nAnalogical arguments are widely present in all known philosophical\ntraditions, including three major ancient traditions: Greek, Chinese,\nand Indian (see\n Historical Supplement).\n Analogies abound in ancient Greek philosophical texts, for example in\nPlato\u2019s dialogues. In the Gorgias, for instance, the\nknack of rhetoric is compared to pastry-baking\u2014seductive but\nultimately unhealthy\u2014whereas philosophy would correspond to\nmedicine\u2014potentially painful and unpleasant but good for the\nsoul/body (Irani 2017). Aristotle discussed analogy extensively in the\nPrior Analytics and in the Topics (see\n section 3.2 of the entry on analogy and analogical reasoning).\n In ancient Chinese philosophy, analogy occupies a very prominent\nposition; indeed, it is perhaps the main form of argumentation for\nChinese thinkers. Mohist thinkers were particularly interested in\nanalogical arguments (see entries on\n logic and language in early Chinese philosophy,\n Mohism and the\n Mohist canons).\n In the Latin medieval tradition too analogy received sustained\nattention, in particular in the domains of logic, theology and\nmetaphysics (see entry on\n medieval theories of analogy).\n\nAnalogical arguments continue to occupy a central position in\nphilosophical discussions, and a number of the most prominent\nphilosophical arguments of the last decades are analogical arguments,\ne.g., Jarvis Thomson\u2019s violinist argument purportedly showing\nthe permissibility of abortion (Thomson 1971), and Searle\u2019s\nChinese Room argument purportedly showing that computers cannot\ndisplay real understanding (see entry on the\n Chinese Room argument).\n (Notice that these two arguments are often described as thought\nexperiments [see entry on\n thought experiments],\n but thought experiments are often based on analogical principles when\nseeking to make a point that transcends the thought experiment as\nsuch.) The Achilles\u2019 heel of analogical arguments can be\nillustrated by these two examples: both arguments have been criticized\non the grounds that the purported similarity between the source and\nthe target domains is not sufficient to extrapolate the property of\nthe source domain (the permissibility of disconnecting from the\nviolinist; the absence of understanding in the Chinese room) to the\ntarget domain (abortion; digital computers and artificial\nintelligence).\n\nIn sum, while analogical arguments in general perhaps confer a lesser\ndegree of conviction than the other three kinds of arguments\ndiscussed, they are widely used both in professional circles and in\neveryday life. They have rightly attracted a fair amount of attention\nfrom scholars in different disciplines, and remain an important object\nof study (see entry on\n analogy and analogical reasoning).\n",
