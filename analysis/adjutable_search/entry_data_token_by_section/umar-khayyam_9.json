Clearly, such a view based on his observation of the world around him is in sharp contrast with the Islamic view presented in the Quran: \u201cI (Allah) have not created the celestial bodies and the earth in vain\u201d (Quran, 38:27). Umar Khayyam was caught between the rationalistic tradition of the Peripatetics deeply entrenched in the Islamic religious universe and his own failure to find any meaning or purpose in human existence on a more immediate and experiential level. Khayyam the poet criticizes the meaninglessness of life whereas Khayyam the philosopher remains loyal to the Islamic Peripatetic tradition which adheres to a theocentric world view.\nUsing the imagery of a kuzah (\u201cjug\u201d) and clay throughout the Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t, Khayyam alludes to the temporality of life and its senselessness:[8]\n\nI saw the potter in the market yesterday\nPounding and pounding upon a piece of clay\n\u201cBehold,\u201d said the clay to the potter\nTreat me gently for once like you, now I am clay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (translation by Aminrazavi)\n\nThe above verse, for example, may be read as suggesting that Khayyam does not see a profound meaning in human existence; his existential anxiety is compounded by the fact that we are subject to our daily share of suffering, a concept that runs contrary to that of the all merciful and compassionate God of Islam.\n",
