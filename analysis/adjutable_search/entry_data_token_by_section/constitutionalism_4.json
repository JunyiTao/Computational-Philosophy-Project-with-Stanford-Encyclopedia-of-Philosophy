    "main_text": "Montesquieu and the Separation of Powers\n5. Montesquieu and the Separation of Powers\n\nDoes the idea of constitutionalism require, as a matter of conceptual\nor practical necessity, the division of government powers urged by\nMontesquieu and celebrated by Americans as a bulwark against abuse of\nstate power? In Regina\u2019s case, there is no such separation:\nlegislative, executive and judicial power all reside in her person.\nBut how, it might be asked, can she be the one (qua judge) who\ndetermines whether her legislation satisfies the prescribed\nconstitutional limitation? Even if, in theory, Regina\u2019s\nconstitution prohibits her from removing her constitutional\nrestriction at will (because she must observe the 2/3rds meta-rule)\ncan she not always choose to ignore her restrictions, or to interpret\nthem so as to escape their binding force? Perhaps Bishop Hoadly was\nright when he said (1717) in a sermon before the English King:\n\u201cWhoever hath an ultimate authority to interpret any written or\nspoken laws, it is he who is truly the Law-giver to all intents and\npurposes, and not the person who first wrote or spoke them.\u201d\n(quoted in Gray 1986, p.12). Although some constitutional limits,\ne.g., the one which restricts the Mexican President to a single term\nof office, seldom raise questions of interpretation, many others\n(particularly those that concern civil rights) are ripe for such\nquestions. Regina might argue that a decree requiring all shops to\nclose on Sundays (the common Sabbath) does not concern a religious\nmatter because its aim is a common day of rest, not religious\nobservance. Others might argue, with seemingly equal plausibility,\nthat it does concern a religious matter and therefore lies outside\nRegina\u2019s legislative competence.\n\nThat constitutions often raise such interpretive questions gives rise\nto an important question: Does the possibility of constitutional\nlimitation on legislative and executive power require, as a matter of\npractical politics, that the judicial power by which such limitations\nare interpreted and enforced reside in some individual or group of\nindividuals distinct from that in which these legislative and\nexecutive powers are vested? In modern terms, must constitutional\nlimits on a legislative body like Parliament, the Duma or Congress, or\nan executive body like the President or her Cabinet, be subject to\ninterpretation and enforcement by an independent judiciary?\nMarbury v Madison settled this question in the affirmative as\na matter of American law, and most nations follow Marbury\n(and Montesquieu) in accepting the practical necessity of some such\narrangement. But it is not clear that the arrangement truly is\npractically necessary, let alone conceptually so. Bishop Hoadly\nnotwithstanding, there is nothing nonsensical in the suggestion that\nX might be bound by an entrenched rule, R, whose\ninterpretation and implementation is left to X. This is,\narguably, the situation in New Zealand where the courts are forbidden\nfrom striking down legislation on the ground that it exceeds\nconstitutional limits. Observance and enforcement of these limits are\nleft to the legislative bodies whose powers are nonetheless recognized\nas constitutionally limited (and subject to whatever pressures might\nbe imposed politically when state actions are generally believed to\nviolate the constitution). It is important to realize that what rule,\nR, actually requires is not necessarily identical with what\nX believes or says that it requires. Nor is it identical with\nwhatever restrictions X actually observes in practice. This\nis so even when there is no superior institution with the power and\nauthority to enforce compliance or to correct X\u2019s\njudgment when it is, or appears to be, wrong.\n\nThat constitutional limits can sometimes be avoided or interpreted so\nas to avoid their effects, and no recourse be available to correct\nmistaken interpretations and abuses of power, does not, then, imply\nthe absence of constitutional limitation. But does it imply the\nabsence of effective limitation? Perhaps so, but even here\nthere is reason to be cautious in drawing general conclusions. Once\nagain, we should remember the long-standing traditions within British\nParliamentary systems (including New Zealand\u2019s) according to\nwhich Parliament alone possesses final authority to create, interpret\nand implement its own constitutional limits. And whatever their\nfaults, there is little doubt that many Parliaments modeled on the\nBritish system typically act responsibly in observing their own\nconstitutional limits.\n\nSo the notion of constitutionalism does not seem conceptually to\nrequire the separation of powers advocated by Montesquieu. Nor does\nthat principle seem to be required as a matter of practical necessity\nin all possible cases. Does this mean that separation of powers has no\nplace in a theory of constitutionalism? It could be suggested that,\nrather than seeing Montesquieu\u2019s tripartite distinction of\ngovernment functions assigned to different government branches as a\nnecessary component of the very concept of separation of powers, we\nshould instead understand that concept in a moralized, flexible and\ncontext-specific manner. On this view, separation of powers dictates\nmore generally that distribution of powers be such that a) tasks are\nallocated to those institutions that are well-suited to carry them out\nand b) there are effective checks on the use of government power\n(Kyritsis 2017, ch 2). However, it does not necessarily prescribe\ncertain institutional forms such as judicial review of primary\nlegislation.\n",
