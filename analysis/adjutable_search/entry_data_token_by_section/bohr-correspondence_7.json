Interpretations in the History and Philosophy Literature\n\nArguably any interpretation of the correspondence principle faces the\nfollowing four challenges: First, determining which (or which\ncombination) of the various analogies or relations between classical\nand quantum mechanics Bohr intended to designate by the correspondence\nprinciple; second, determining the scope of the correspondence\nprinciple (i.e., does it apply only to large quantum numbers or all\nquantum numbers); third, offering an explanation for why Bohr thought\nthat the correspondence principle should be thought of as a\nlaw of quantum theory; and finally, offering an explanation\nfor why Bohr thought that the correspondence principle had been\nformalized, and hence preserved, in modern (matrix) quantum\nmechanics.\n\nOne of the most influential discussions of Bohr\u2019s correspondence\nprinciple appears in Max Jammer\u2019s 1966 book The Conceptual\nDevelopment of Quantum Mechanics. Jammer takes the correspondence\nprinciple to be a relation between the kinematics of the electron and\nthe properties of the emitted radiation. Like many interpreters of the\ncorrespondence principle, he focuses primarily on the frequency\nrelation. He notes that Bohr also found an asymptotic correspondence\nbetween the intensities of the spectral lines and the amplitudes in\nthe classical harmonic components, as well as a correspondence between\nthe polarization of the emitted radiation and the character of the\nclassical motion. Although Jammer notes these other correspondences,\nhe seems to interpret the frequency correspondence as the primary\ncorrespondence principle. Regarding the status of this correspondence\nas a principle, Jammer writes,\n\nIn the limit, therefore, the quantum-theoretic frequency\n\\(\\nu_{qu}\\) coincides with the classical\nmechanical frequency \\(\\nu_{cl}\\). By demanding\nthat this correspondence remain approximately valid also for moderate\nand small quantum numbers, Bohr generalized and modified into a\nprinciple what in the limit may be regarded formally as a theorem.\n(Jammer 1966, p. 111)\n\n\nAccording to Jammer, the correspondence principle, interpreted as the\nfrequency relation, applies by fiat to all quantum numbers and hence\nobtains the status of a \u201cprinciple,\u201d even though it is an\n\u201capproximate\u201d relation that is only exact for large\nquantum numbers.\n\nJammer is rather dismissive of Bohr\u2019s claim that the\ncorrespondence principle should be thought of as a law of quantum\ntheory. He writes,\n\nFor taking resort to classical physics in order to establish\nquantum-theoretic predictions, or in other words, constructing a\ntheory whose corroboration depends on premises which conflict with the\nsubstance of the theory, is of course a serious inconsistency from the\nlogical point of view. Being fully aware of this difficulty, Bohr\nattempted repeatedly to show that \u2018the correspondence principle\nmust be regarded purely as a law of the quantum theory\u2019. (Jammer\n1966, p. 116)\n\n\nOn Jammer\u2019s view, Bohr\u2019s claim that the correspondence\nprinciple is a law is simply an attempt to cover up the inconsistent\nfoundations of the old quantum theory. In opposition to Bohr\u2019s\nclaim that quantum theory is a rational generalization of classical\nmechanics, Jammer interprets Bohr as viewing quantum and classical\nmechanics as irreconcilable, and hence interprets the correspondence\nprinciple as only a \u201cformal analogy of heuristic value.\u201d\nAt the end of his discussion of the correspondence principle, Jammer\nconcludes \u201chis [Bohr\u2019s] numerous and often somewhat\nconflicting statements, made from 1920 to 1961, on the essence of the\ncorrespondence principle make it difficult, if not impossible, to\nascribe to Bohr a clear-cut unvarying conception of the\nprinciple\u201d (Jammer 1966, p. 117).\n\nIt is perhaps for this reason that Jagdish Mehra and Helmut Rechenberg\n(1982), in their comprehensive history of the development of quantum\ntheory, make no concrete commitment as to which of the several\ncorrespondence relations discussed by Bohr should be designated as the\ncorrespondence principle. Like Jammer they struggle to understand why\nBohr thought the correspondence principle applied to small quantum\nnumbers and why it should be considered a law of quantum theory. They\nwrite, \u201c[T]he extension of the analogy \u2018in some way\u2019\nto small quantum numbers represented a most daring assumption\u2026\n[Bohr] felt confident that an extension of his relations for\nfrequencies and intensities, which were valid in the high quantum\nnumber limit, might eventually be justified also when low quantum\nnumbers were involved\u201d (Mehra and Rechenberg 1982, p. 250).\nAlthough they offer one of the more technically detailed discussions\nof the correspondence principle, they do not discuss either\nBohr\u2019s claim that it should be considered a law nor Bohr\u2019s\nclaim that the correspondence principle is formalized into the new\nquantum mechanics.\n\nAn alternative interpretation of Bohr\u2019s correspondence principle\nhas been defended by Olivier Darrigol in his excellent and highly\nreadable history of quantum theory From \\(c\\)-Numbers to\n\\(q\\)-Numbers. Instead of viewing the correspondence\nprinciple as a statement about quantum and classical frequencies, he\ninterprets it as what was earlier called the intensity\ncorrespondence: The quantum transition probability between two\nstationary states separated by \\(\\tau\\) is proportional to the squared\nmodulus of the classical amplitude of the \\(\\tau\\)th harmonic\nvibration, which classically is a measure of the intensity (see\nEquation 5).\n\nDarrigol writes,\n\nBohr assumed that, even for moderately excited states, the probability\nof a given quantum jump was approximately given by the intensity of\nthe \u2018corresponding\u2019 harmonic component of the motion in\nthe initial stationary state. This is what Bohr called \u2018the\ncorrespondence principle\u2019. (Darrigol 1997, p. 550; see also\nDarrigol 1992, p. 126)\n\n\nStrictly speaking this intensity correspondence is exact only in the\nlimit of large quantum numbers, and cannot be extended to small\nquantum numbers. The one exception to this is when the classical\namplitude is zero, the quantum transition probability will also be\nzero (a special case of what was earlier called Bohr\u2019s\nselection rule), which does hold for all quantum numbers.\n\nUnlike some interpreters of the correspondence principle Darrigol does\nbelieve that there is a coherent and rational account of Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle in terms of the intensity correspondence. He\nargues that Bohr is justified in calling it a law of quantum\ntheory because \u201c[i]t was indeed a relation between two\nquantum theoretical concepts: the probability of a quantum jump, and\natomic motion\u201d (Darrigol 1997, p. 553). Moreover, Darrigol\ncogently argues that this correspondence was incorporated directly\ninto matrix mechanics in Heisenberg\u2019s 1925 paper, thus\nvindicating Bohr\u2019s claim that the new quantum mechanics can be\nregarded as \u201ca precise formulation of the tendencies embodied in\nthe correspondence principle\u201d (Bohr 1925, p. 852; BCW 5, p.\n280).\n\nDespite this continuity, Darrigol argues that there was a fundamental,\nthough implicit, shift in Bohr\u2019s understanding of the\ncorrespondence principle:\n\nOriginally, the motion to which the \u2018correspondence\u2019 was\napplied was the motion in stationary states, formally described by the\norbiting electrons. In the end, this motion had nothing to do with the\ndescription of stationary states, it was purely\n\u2018symbolic.\u2019 (Darrigol 1997, p. 558)\n\n\nBy \u2018formally\u2019 Darrigol means that the space-time relations\nand dynamical relations were retained in the description of the\nelectron\u2019s motion of the atom, although it was recognized that\nthere was no possibility of actually observing this motion. Once it\nbecame a \u2018symbolic\u2019 relation, the space-time description\nwas lost completely.\n\nHans Radder has also argued that Bohr\u2019s understanding of the\ncorrespondence principle evolved over his career. Radder (1991)\nidentifies three different phases. In the first phase (from about 1913\nto 1915) the correspondence principle was merely a \u201cnumerical\ncorrespondence\u201d; that is, it concerned a numerical agreement of\nthe values of certain quantities in classical mechanics (and\nelectrodynamics) and the old quantum theory. In the second phase,\nlasting between 1916 and 1922, the correspondence principle was not\njust a numerical agreement but involved a conceptual continuity as\nwell: \u201cThe same fundamental concepts \\(\\omega_{n,\\tau}\\) and\n\\(C_{n,\\tau}\\), which govern the motion of the electrons in their\norbits, and the same function \\(f\\) determining the transition\nprobabilities are claimed to underlie both kinds of theory\u201d\n(Radder 1991, p. 206). In the third phase from 1923 until 1925 when\nthe new matrix (quantum) mechanics was introduced, the conceptual\ncontinuity was abandoned in favor of a \u201cformal\u201d\ncorrespondence. Radder means something different than Darrigol when he\ndescribes the correspondence principle as \u201cformal.\u201d He\nexplains,\n\nNow conceptual correspondence, linked as it was to the mechanical\norbital model was rejected as a basis for atomic theory and the\norbital model was provisionally replaced by the so-called\n\u2018virtual field model\u2019\u2026 [T]hese relations between\nterms are formal (not conceptual) correspondences,\nexpressing the existence of certain relations of mathematical identity\nor substitution. (Radder 1991, p. 207)\n\n\nRadder\u2019s chief concern is relating the various incarnations of\nBohr\u2019s correspondence principle to the more general\ncorrespondence and heuristics arguments in the philosophy of science\nliterature (see Section 7 below).\n\nOther recent interpretations of Bohr\u2019s correspondence principle\ninclude Robert Batterman\u2019s, according to which \u201cthe CP is\na statement to the effect that the radiative processes to which the\nsecond postulate \\([h\\nu = E' - E'']\\) applies are\n\u2018correlated\u2019 with, or \u2018correspond\u2019 to,\nmechanical vibrations or periodic motions of the charged particles,\nthe electrons, in the atom\u201d (Batterman 1991, p. 203). Batterman\nrightly notes that the correspondence principle is not the claim that\nquantum mechanics must contain classical mechanics as a limiting case,\nand argues that the asymptotic agreement of classical and quantum\nfrequencies (the frequency interpretation) is not the correspondence\nprinciple, but rather something that is justified and\nexplained by the correspondence principle.\n\nSimilarly, Scott Tanona (2004) rejects the view that Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle is about an asymptotic agreement of quantum\nand classical theories. He argues instead that Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle should be understood primarily as a\nconnection between spectra (radiation) and orbital motion. More\nbroadly, Tanona argues that the correspondence principle should not be\nunderstood as a heuristic tool for theory construction, but rather as\nan epistemological tool, whose \u201cmain purpose within Bohr\u2019s\nempirical approach was to bridge the epistemological gap between\nempirical phenomena and the unknown atomic structure \u2026 by\nassociating classical properties of spectra with atomic\nproperties\u201d (Tanona 2004, p. 683).\n\nMore recently, Alisa Bokulich (2008, and 2009 [Other Internet\nResources]) has argued that Bohr\u2019s correspondence principle\nshould be understood in terms of what she calls Bohr\u2019s\nselection rule. This selection rule states that \u201cthe\ntransition from a stationary state \\(n'\\) to another\nstationary state \\(n''\\) is allowed if and only if\nthere exists a \\(\\tau\\)th harmonic in the classical motion of\nthe electron in the stationary state; if there is no\n\\(\\tau\\)th harmonic in the classical motion, then transitions\nbetween stationary states whose separation is \\(\\tau\\) are not allowed\nquantum mechanically\u201d (Bokulich 2008, p. 85). Thus, the\ncorrespondence principle, on this reading of Bohr, is defined as the\nstatement that each allowed quantum transition between stationary\nstates corresponds to one harmonic component of the classical motion.\nShe argues that the asymptotic agreements of frequencies and\nintensities emphasized by Jammer and Darrigol respectively are\napplications or consequences of the correspondence principle,\nbut not the correspondence principle itself. Moreover, she argues that\nthe selection rule interpretation of Bohr\u2019s correspondence\nprinciple best makes sense of Bohr\u2019s claims that the\ncorrespondence principle applies to small \\(n\\), that it is a law\nof quantum theory, and that it is formalized and preserved in matrix\nmechanics.\n",
