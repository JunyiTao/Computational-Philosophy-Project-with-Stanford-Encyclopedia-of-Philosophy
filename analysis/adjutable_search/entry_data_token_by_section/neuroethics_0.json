    "main_text": "The rise and scope of neuroethics\n1. The rise and scope of neuroethics\n\nNeuroethics focuses on ethical issues raised by our continually\nimproving understanding of the brain, and by consequent improvements\nin our ability to monitor and influence brain function. Significant\nattention to neuroethics can be traced to 2002, when the Dana\nFoundation organized a meeting of neuroscientists, ethicists, and\nother thinkers, entitled Neuroethics: Mapping the Field. A\nparticipant at that meeting, columnist and wordsmith William Safire,\nis often credited with introducing and establishing the meaning of the\nterm \u201cneuroethics\u201d, defining it as \u2018the examination\nof what is right and wrong, good and bad about the treatment of,\nperfection of, or unwelcome invasion of and worrisome manipulation of\nthe human brain\u2019 (Marcus, 2002, p.5). Others contend that the\nword \u201cneuroethics\u201d was in use prior to this (Illes, 2003;\nRacine, 2010), although all agree that these earlier uses did not\nemploy it in a disciplinary sense, or to refer to the entirety of the\nethical issues raised by neuroscience.\n\nAnother attendee at that initial meeting, Adina Roskies, in response\nto a perceived lack of recognition of the potential novelty of\nneuroethics, penned \u201cNeuroethics for the new millennium\u201d\n(Roskies, 2002), an article in which she proposed a bipartite division\nof neuroethics into the \u201cethics of neuroscience\u201d, which\nencompasses the kinds of ethical issues raised by Safire, and\n\u201cthe neuroscience of ethics\u201d, thus suggesting an extension\nof the scope of neuroethics to encompass our burgeoning understanding\nof the biological basis of ethical thought and behavior and the ways\nin which this could itself influence and inform our ethical thinking.\nThis broadening of the scope of neuroethics highlights the obvious and\nnot-so-obvious ways that understanding our own moral thinking might\naffect our moral views; it is one aspect of neuroethics that\ndistinguishes it from traditional bioethics. Another way of\ncharacterizing the field is as a study of ethical issues arising from\nwhat we can do to the brain (e.g. with neurotechnologies) and from\nwhat we know about it (including, for example, understanding the basis\nof ethical behavior).\n\nAlthough Roskies\u2019 definition remains influential, it has been\nchallenged in various ways. Some have argued that neuroethics should\nnot be limited to the neuroscience of ethics, but rather be broadened\nto the cognitive science of ethics (Levy, personal communication),\nsince so much work that enables us to understand the brain takes place\nin disciplines outside of neuroscience, strictly defined. This is in\nfact in the spirit of the original proposal, since it has been widely\nrecognized that the brain sciences encompass a wide array of\ndisciplines, methods, and questions. However, the most persistent\ncriticisms have been from those who have questioned whether the\nneuroscience of ethics should be considered a part of neuroethics at\nall: they argue that understanding our ethical faculties is a\nscientific and not an ethical issue, and thus should not be part of\nneuroethics. This argument is usually followed by a denial that\nneuroethics is sufficiently distinct from traditional bioethics to\nwarrant being called a discipline in its own right.\n\nThe response to these critics is different: Whether or not these\nvarious branches of inquiry form a natural kind or are themselves a\nfocus of ethical analysis is quite beside the point. Neuroethics is\nporous. One cannot successfully engage with many of the ethical issues\nwithout also understanding the science. In addition, academic or\nintellectual disciplines are at least in part (if not entirely) social\nconstructs. And in this case the horse is out of the barn: It is clear\nthat interesting and significant work is being pursued regarding the\nbrain bases of ethical thought and behavior, and that this theoretical\nunderstanding has influenced, and has the potential to influence, our\nown thinking about ethics and our ethical practices. That neuroethics\nexists is undeniable: Neuroethical lines of research have borne\ninteresting fruit over the last 10\u201315 years; neuroethics is now\nrecognized as an area of study both nationally and internationally;\nneuroethics courses are taught at many universities; and training\nprograms, professional societies, and research centers for neuroethics\nhave already been established. The NIH BRAIN Initiative has devoted\nconsiderable resources to encouraging neuroscientific projects that\nincorporate neuroethical projects and analyses. Neuroethics is a\ndiscipline in its own right in part because we already structure our\npractices in ways that recognize it as such. What is most significant\nabout neuroethics is not whether both the ethics of neuroscience and\nthe neuroscience of ethics are given the same overarching disciplinary\nname, but that there are people working on both endeavors and that\nthey are in dialogue (and sometimes, the very\u00a0same people do\nboth).\n\nOf course, to the extent that neuroethicists asks questions about\ndisease, treatment, and so on, the questions will look familiar, and\nfor answers they can and should look to extant work in traditional\nbioethics so as not to reinvent the wheel. But, ultimately, Farah is\ncorrect in saying that \u201cNew ethical issues are arising as\nneuroscience gives us unprecedented ways to understand the human mind\nand to predict, influence, and even control it. These issues lead us\nbeyond the boundaries of bioethics into the philosophy of mind,\npsychology, theology, law and neuroscience itself. It is this larger\nset of issues that has\u2026earned it a name of its own\u201d\n(Farah 2010, p. 2).\n",
