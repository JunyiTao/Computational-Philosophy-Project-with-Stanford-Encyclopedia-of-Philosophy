    "main_text": "Engagement vs. Detachment || Embodiment\n2.4 Embodiment\nWe see, then, that in their critique of third-person detachment\nexistentialists forward the idea that we are already \u201ccaught up\nin the world\u201d (Merleau-Ponty 1945 [1962, 5]). And an essential\naspect of being caught up in this way is the experience of one\u2019s\nown embodiment and the crucial role that bodily orientation,\naffectivity, perception, and motility play in our everyday\nbeing-in-the-world. In this way, philosophers such as Merleau-Ponty,\nSartre, Beauvoir, and Marcel challenge the traditional interpretation\nof the body. Against the standard \u201cCartesian account,\u201d the\nbody is not regarded as a discrete, causally determined object,\nextended in space, and set apart from the disinterested gaze of the\ncognizing mind. The body is not something I have. It is a site of\naffectivity and meaning. It is who I am. And I cannot obtain\nobjective knowledge of my body because I am already living through it;\nit is the experiential medium of my existence. \u201cThe body,\u201d\nas Sartre puts it, \u201cis lived and not\nknown.\u201d (1943 [1956,\n 427])[2]\nBy building on the analysis of the lived body (corps\npropre, corps v\u00e9cu, corps vivant,\nLeib), existentialists reveal how our moods, perceptions, and\nexperiences are already bound up in worldly meanings, how we\ninternalize these meanings, and how this act of internalization shapes\nthe way we live, how we handle the tools of daily life, maneuver\nthrough lived space, relate to others, and interpret and perform our\nidentities. In her pathbreaking work The Second Sex, Beauvoir\nilluminates this point by showing how a woman tends to internalize the\ndominant androcentric worldview, resulting in a representation of\nherself as subordinate, weak, and inferior. She is the \u201csecond\nsex\u201d not because she is born with a particular biological body,\nbut because she inhabits, enacts, and embodies the oppressive meanings\nand practices unique to her patriarchal situation. As Beauvoir famously\nputs it, the woman \u201cis not born, but rather\nbecomes a woman.\u201d This is because \u201cthe body is not\na thing; it is a situation\u2026 subject to taboos [and] laws\u2026\nIt is a reference to certain values from which [she] evaluates\n[herself]\u201d (1949 [1952, 34, 36]).\nThe existentialist\u2019s distinction between the object-body and\nthe lived-body has made it possible for contemporary philosophers and\nsocial theorists to engage the lived experience of those who have been\nhistorically marginalized by the western tradition. By rejecting the\nstandpoint of theoretical detachment and focusing on the structures of\nembodiment and being-in-the-world, influential thinkers such as Franz\nFanon (1952 [1967]), Iris Marion Young (1984 [2000]), and Judith Butler\n(1990), among others, have explored different ways in which we enact\nand embody forms of oppression and how this can shape our self-image\nand inhibit the experience of movement, spatial orientation, and other\nforms of bodily comportment. These investigations help to broaden and\npluralize our understanding of the human condition by shedding light on\na diverse range of embodied perspectives, from ethnicity and race, sex\nand gender, and age and physical ability. And insofar as these analyses\nhelp capture what is distinct about the meaning-giving activity of\nhumans, they illuminate what is arguably the unifying principle of\nexistentialism: \u201cexistence precedes essence.\u201d \n",
