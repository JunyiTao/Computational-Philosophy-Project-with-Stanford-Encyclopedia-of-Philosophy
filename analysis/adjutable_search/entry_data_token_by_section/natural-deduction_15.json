    "main_text": "IntElim and some Possible Philosophical Consequences || IntElim as the Correct View of Logic\n7.1 IntElim as the Correct View of Logic\n\nAs we mentioned above, Gentzen saw his set of rules as being organized\ninto Introduction rules and Elimination rules. He also had remarked\nthat the Introduction rules were \u201clike\u201d introducing\nsomething (namely, a sentence with a given major connective) into a\nproof and the corresponding Elimination rule was \u201clike\u201d\nsimplifying the complex sentence into (at least one of) its component\nparts. This is the ideal of an Int-Elim organization of the rules of a\nlogic. To some, this is the ideal of what a logic should be, and gives\nan important clue, again according to some, as to what is The One True\nLogic. Gentzen (1934) showed that his formulation of intuitionistic\nLogic had this feature, but apparently thought that the extra rule(s)\nor axiom(s) required for classical Logic did not manifest this\nproperty. (Or at least, not straightforwardly.) This has led many\nphilosophers of logic, notably Michael Dummett (1977, 1975 [1978],\n1991; and others of his works), to claim that intuitionism is The One\nTrue Logic. (See Schroeder-Heister 2018; Steinberger 2011, and the\nfinal section of Shapiro & Kouri Kissel 2021, for further remarks\non this. See also Read 2006 for a lively defense of the claim.)\n\nHowever, the claim of the superiority of IntElim rules has seemed to\nsome to be either shaky or perhaps circular. Consider the case of a\nnew binary connective, TONK, proposed in\nPrior (1960), whose (complete) meaning was to be given by the\nintroduction rule: from \\(\\phi\\) infer \\((\\phi\\) TONK\n\\(\\psi)\\), and the elimination rule: from\n\\((\\phi\\) TONK \\(\\psi)\\) infer \\(\\psi\\). If\nlogic rules are to be given merely in terms of some Introduction and\nsome Elimination conditions, then TONK has\njust been given a proper Int-Elim definition. But as Prior notes,\nlogic becomes much more \u201cegalitarian\u201d with this new\nconnective\u2026too egalitarian, perhaps!\n\nPrior\u2019s article elicited a large volume of responses, many in\nthe early-mid-1960s in the pages of Analysis. Perhaps the\nbest of these is Belnap (1962), which responded by arguing that\n\u201cmeaning-in-a-language\u201d involved more than simply\nsupplying a connective with some introduction rule and\nsome elimination rule: the proposed connective needed also to\nbe able \u201cfit in\u201d with other aspects of the language.\nFurthermore, and importantly, the Int-Elim ideal required that the\nelimination rule was required only to \u201cundo\u201d the\neffect of the introduction rule. But the TONK-E\nrule obviously did very much more.\n\nAccording to this view, if the introduction and the elimination rules\nare to be \u201creverse images of one another\u201d, so that the\nelimination rule for connectives were merely \u201cconsequences of\nthe definition given for the introduction of the connective\u201d,\nthen the elimination rule for TONK would\nneed to be the following pair of rules, TONK-Elim-Left\nand TONK-Elim-Right:\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFigure 9 [An\n extended description of figure 9\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nAfter all, the TONK-E rule is supposed to\nconclude \\(B\\) from \\((A\\) TONK \\(B)\\), but\ngiven that the TONK-I rule introduced the\n\\((A\\) TONK \\(B)\\) formula merely from the\nprevious formula \\(A\\), clearly\u2014if we are to honour the view\nthat the elimination operation only has the effect of\n\u201cundoing\u201d the introduction rule\u2014we need it to be the\ncase that \\(A\\) already entailed \\(B\\).\n\nIt is equally possible to keep the elimination rule as initially\nstated\u2014from \\((A\\) TONK \\(B)\\) infer\n\\(B\\)\u2014but to change the introduction rule so as to guarantee\nthat no new information is added by an\n elimination[24]:\n\n\n\nFigure 10 [An\n extended description of figure 10\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThe generalization of this feature is now called Harmony by\nmost of the concerned theorists (see Read 2004; Steinberger 2011,\namong many others, for discussion). As we have already remarked, many\nhave claimed that this is the \u201cproper\u201d form of rules of\nlogic: it is the key to describing what is \u201cmeant\u201d by a\nlogical connective and also what a restriction on The One True Logic\nis\u2014namely, that all its connectives must exemplify this\nproperty. And hence many theorists have claimed that Intuitionistic\nLogic is The One True Logic. (For examples of forcefully articulated\nopinions on the matter, see Read 2006, 2008, 2010.)\n\nA possibly serious challenge to the thought that Harmony is\nthe central feature of an adequate logic comes from\nconsiderations on identity. The introduction and elimination rules for\nidentity are usually seen as in\n figure 11.\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFigure 11: Traditional IntElim Rules for\nIdentity. [An\n extended description of figure 11\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nIt is not at all obvious how this \\(=\\)-E rule just \u201creverses\nthe effect\u201d of the \\(=\\)-I rule here.\n\nAn early proposal to answer this was made in Read (2004), thinking of\ndefining identity by means of indiscernibility: \\(\\forall\nF((Fa\\leftrightarrow Fb)\\leftrightarrow a=b)\\). This can be put into\nthe form of an Intuitionistic rule-pair, as in\n figure 12.\n But of course, for the \\(=\\)-I rule to correctly mirror the\nsecond-order quantification of the indiscernibility principle, the\n\\(F\\) needs to be \u201ctruly arbitrary\u201d (perhaps: a unary\npredicate that does not occur in any assumption other than the present\none). The \\(F\\) in the \\(=\\)-E rule, on the other hand, is any unary\npredicate of the language. There is a burgeoning literature on this\ntopic, much of it focussing on whether it is legitimate to incorporate\nfeatures of second-order logic in the ways required.\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFigure 12: Read\u2019s (2004)\nIndiscernability IntElim Rules for Identity.
