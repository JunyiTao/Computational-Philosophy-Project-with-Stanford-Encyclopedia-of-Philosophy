Phenomenological Counterarguments\n\n\nMany of the arguments against the conventionality thesis make use of\nparticular physical phenomena, together with the laws of physics, to\nestablish simultaneity (or, equivalently, to measure the one-way speed\nof light). Salmon (1977), for example, discusses a number of such\nschemes and argues that each makes use of a nontrivial convention. For\ninstance, one such scheme uses the law of conservation of momentum to\nconclude that two particles of equal mass, initially located halfway\nbetween A and B and then separated by an explosion,\nmust arrive at A and B\nsimultaneously. Salmon (1977, 273) argues,\nhowever, that the standard formulation of the law of conservation of\nmomentum makes use of the concept of one-way velocities, which cannot\nbe measured without the use of (something equivalent to) synchronized\nclocks at the two ends of the spatial interval that is traversed;\nthus, it is a circular argument to use conservation of momentum to\ndefine simultaneity.\n\n\nIt has been argued (see, for example, Janis 1983,  103\u2013105, and\nNorton 1986, 119) that all such schemes for establishing\nconvention-free synchrony must fail. The argument can be summarized as\nfollows: Suppose that clocks are set in standard synchrony, and\nconsider the detailed space-time description of the proposed\nsynchronization procedure that would be obtained with the use of such\nclocks. Next suppose that the clocks are reset in some nonstandard\nfashion (consistent with the causal order of events), and consider the\ndescription of the same sequence of events that would be obtained with\nthe use of the reset clocks. In such a description, familiar laws may\ntake unfamiliar forms, as in the case of the law of conservation of\nmomentum in the example mentioned above. Indeed, all of special\nrelativity has been reformulated (in an unfamiliar form) in terms of\nnonstandard synchronies (Winnie 1970a and 1970b). Since the proposed\nsynchronization procedure can itself be described in terms of a\nnonstandard synchrony, the scheme cannot describe a sequence of events\nthat is incompatible with nonstandard synchrony. A comparison of the\ntwo descriptions makes clear what hidden assumptions in the scheme are\nequivalent to standard synchrony. Nevertheless, editors of respected\njournals continue to accept, from time to time, papers purporting to\nmeasure one-way light speeds; see, for example, Greaves et\nal. (2009). Application of the procedure just described shows\nwhere their errors lie.\n",
