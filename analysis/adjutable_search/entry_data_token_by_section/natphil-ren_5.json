    "main_text": "Aristotelian Tenets, Platonic Tenets, and More || Principles and Matter\n4.1 Principles and Matter\n4.1.1 Principles\n\nAccording to Aristotle, if the sublunar world was characterized by\nmutability, the supralunar world was\u2014on the\ncontrary\u2014absolutely immutable. The fundamental principles of\nAristotelian physics were in fact matter, form, and privation, and the\nnatural sublunar world was therefore the location where according to\nthese principles generation and corruption took place. Independent\nphilosophers offered alternatives to these principles and to the\nAristotelian hylemorphic apparatus. In order to describe nature within\nits own limits, Bernardino Telesio (1509\u20131588)\u2014a staunch\nopponent of Aristotelianism\u2014defended a different set of\nprinciples which had already been proposed by authors such Girolamo\nCardano (1501\u20131576) and Girolamo Fracastoro (circa\n1476\u20131553), and which he argued was based on data gathered from\nexperience rather than on arbitrary constructions. These alternative\nprinciples were passive matter and active force, the latter\ndistinguished into heat and cold. It was the interplay\u2014or\nrather, the battle\u2014between these opposite forces that brought\nabout the natural world. Since every natural being depends on the\ninteraction between cold and heat, it must know what is necessary for\nits survival: therefore everything, including the forces themselves,\npossesses sensation, which was not related to the faculties of the\nsoul, as in Aristotelian psychology. This connection between\nsensus and self-preservation was also advocated by Tommaso\nCampanella, who emphasized its importance for natural magic.\nTelesio\u2019s polemical refusal of Aristotle and his call for\nphysical inquiry made within natural limits was appreciated and\npraised even by those who recognized the contradictions in his\ntheories. Francesco Patrizi (1529\u20131597), who attacked Aristotle\nfrom a Platonic perspective in his Nova de Universis\nPhilosophia (1591), rebuked Telesio for the latter\u2019s claim\nto have relied exclusively on the senses and rejected reason: he\npointed out that, in reality, Telesio did rely on metaphysical\narguments, though he claimed to deny them (for his part, Patrizi\nbelieved that natural philosophy requires metaphysical tools to fill\nin its gaps). The same recognition of too much reliance on metaphysics\ndrove Francis Bacon (1561\u20131626) to reject Telesio\u2019s views\nin favor of experimental empiricism and of a full endorsement of the\ntestimony of sensory perception.\n4.1.2 The Nature of Matter\n\nMost Aristotelian interpreters believed matter to be prope\nnihil, pure potentiality, while others believed that it possessed\na certain degree of reality and actuality. The discussion on the\nnature of matter was further complicated by the suggestions offered by\nother traditions of thought, Platonism above all. According to\nMarsilio Ficino (1433\u20131499) in his Platonic Theology,\nprime matter had an existence which is not dependent upon form.\nClosely following the Timaeus, he claimed that matter can\ntherefore be intelligible, though in a weaker way. Giordano Bruno\n(1548\u20131600) proposed an even more radical departure from\ntraditional views of the passivity of matter. In the De la causa,\nprincipio et uno, Bruno affirmed that matter is an active\nprinciple, not passive. Matter contains within itself every form, both\ncorporeal and incorporeal, and can be described as a kind of infinite\nlife. Bruno\u2019s conception of matter also served as the basis for\nhis cosmological views (see below), and in particular for his claim\nthat the universe is infinite. A few years later, Tommaso Campanella\nreturned to a more traditional position. In the Del senso delle\ncose e della magia (printed in 1620) he argued for the synonymity\nbetween matter and body, and against the identification of matter with\nthe Aristotelian prope nihil, though he did emphasize its\npassivity: matter receives forms from external agents and does not\nproduce them from within itself.\n\nClosely related to these problems was Aristotle\u2019s doctrine of\nprime matter, which had controversial implications: as matter was\neternal, so was the world, and therefore the Christian dogma of the\ncreation of the world was untenable. Scholastic philosophers had long\nstruggled with this subject during the Middle Ages, and the most\ninteresting developments during the Renaissance were driven by the\nconfrontation between Aristotelianism and Platonism. Plato, in the\nTimaeus, had clearly spoken of a God-creator, and once again\nhis doctrines were adopted by authors anxious to establish a new\nphilosophical foundation for Christianity. Bessarion (d. 1472), for\nexample, admitted that according to Plato matter was eternal, but that\nhe distinguished it clearly from the creator, who possesses a superior\neternity. In similar fashion, Marsilio Ficino expressly described\nprime matter as created and therefore not subject to generation and\ncorruption. Aristotelians were not always afraid, however, to argue\nfor the eternity of the prime matter: Francesco Vimercato\n(1512\u20131569), in his posthumous De rerum principiis, is\nthe most remarkable example. As late as the beginning of the\nseventeenth century, the debate continued: Cesare Crivellati composed\na dialogue (1617) between Plato and Aristotle in which the master\nrebukes his unfaithful student for teaching such an impious doctrine.\nOn the other hand, there were also authors who attempted to establish\nan accord between Plato and Aristotle on this sensitive issue: a good\nexample is the De naturae philosophia seu de Platonis et\nAristotelis consensione (1554) by Sebastian Fox Morcillo\n(1526\u20131560), in which the Spanish philosopher compares the\ndoctrines of the Timaeus and the Physics, and\nemphasizes the limits of both in front of the perfection of\nreligion.\n\nOther thinkers instead had a pragmatic approach to prime matter:\nalchemists like the Swiss physician Paracelsus (1493\u20131541)\nsought to find a principle to which every substance could be reduced.\nThough openly challenging traditional university teaching, Paracelsus\ndid not reject canonical motifs. For example, he relied on the four\nelements (air, fire, water, earth), but he also proposed a new triad:\nsulfur, mercury, and salt. Yet, even this proposal was not as\niconoclastic as it appears, since it was partially founded on the\nAristotelian doctrine of the formation of metals contained in the\nMeteorology (341b 6ff.). Nonetheless, by emphasizing the\nprocesses of association and dissociation of substances, Paracelsus\noffered an important contribution to the transformation of alchemy\ninto chemistry (even if the two terms were often intended as\ninterchangeable). Gradually chemistry separated from physics,\nunderstood as the science of bodies subject to movement, and\npositioned itself as the science of bodies associated and dissociated.\nJohann Baptist Van Helmont (1579\u20131644), who opposed the\nParacelsian principles, developed a corpuscular doctrine of matter, a\nvariant of atomistic theory. Atomism in the Renaissance was typically\nrelated to the Neoplatonic concept of semina and to the\nEpicurean philosophy, and was usually advocated by radical\nanti-Aristotelian thinkers like Giordano Bruno. And while it is true\nthat Aristotle rejected atomism and the existence of the void, there\nwere ways to argue for a Peripatetic version of atomism.\n\n\n\n\nSome medieval philosophers admitted the existence of minima\nnaturalia, the limits beyond which form is not conserved. The\ndoctrine of the minima was intended to resolve a problem\nraised by Aristotle in On Generation and Corruption (327a\n30\u2013328b 24), namely, that of the necessity of finding a\nphilosophical justification for combination, an intermediate\nphenomenon between generation and corruption. Over the course of the\nRenaissance the doctrine of minima naturalia was further\nelaborated by authors like Agostino Nifo (circa 1469\u2013circa 1539)\nand Julius Caesar Scaliger (1484\u20131558). Scaliger granted a\nconsistency to the minima, making them not mere limits, but\nreal physical components that cannot be further divided. Furthermore,\nhe rejected traditional atomism, because it did not achieve the\ncontinuity of the corpuscles which constitute a body. Despite their\nopposition to Peripateticism, the corpuscularism of Van Helmont and\nDaniel Sennert (1572\u20131637) was rooted in this tradition.\nSennert, in particular, was unable to reject the Aristotelian concept\nof form, and aimed instead to establish a concord between\nAristotelianism and atomism. Even in a work programmatically entitled\nPhilosophia Naturalis adversus Aristotelem (1621), Sebastian\nBasson\u2014who defended corpuscularism\u2014denied the existence of\nthe void and rejected a mechanization of the natural world. It was\nGalileo Galilei who made a bold departure from the qualitative\nbackground of Aristotelian matter, defending a mechanistic form of\natomism in which atoms did not have dimensions. Despite the attempts\nof Pierre Gassendi (1592\u20131655) to conciliate it with\nChristianity, atomism bothered traditionalists also for its\ntheological implications, both large (the teleological vision of the\nworld) and small (transubstantiation). Even Ren\u00e9 Descartes\n(1596\u20131650) came under attack for this reason. Debate over the\nexistence of the void was also lively throughout the seventeenth\ncentury, largely because of the experimental work of Evangelista\nTorricelli (1608\u20131647), Valeriano Magni (1586\u20131661), Otto\nVon Guericke (1602\u20131686), and Robert Boyle (1627\u20131691),\nwho opposed the traditional views of the so-called\n\u201cplenists\u201d. \n",
