    "main_text": "Plato\u2019s reading audience\n1. Plato\u2019s reading audience\n\nFor whom did Plato write? Who was his readership? A very good survey\nof this topic is Yunis 2007 from which I would like to quote the\nfollowing illuminating passage: \u201cbefore Plato, philosophers\ntreated arcane subjects in technical treatises that had no appeal\noutside small circles of experts. These writings, \u2018on\nnature\u2019, \u2018on truth\u2019, \u2018on being\u2019 and so\non, mostly in prose, some in verse, were demonstrative, not\nprotreptic. Plato, on the other hand, broke away from the experts and\nsought to treat ethical problems of universal relevance and to make\nphilosophy accessible to the public\u201d (13). Other scholars, such\nas Morgan (2003), have also argued that Plato addressed in his\nwritings both philosophical and non-philosophical audiences.\n\nIt is true that in the Republic Plato has the following\nadvice for philosophers: \u201clike someone who takes refuge under a\nlittle wall from a storm of dust or hail driven by the wind, the\nphilosopher\u2014seeing others filled with lawlessness\u2014is\nsatisfied if he can somehow lead his present life free from injustice\nand impious acts and depart from it with good hope, blameless and\ncontent\u201d (496d\u2013e) (unless otherwise noted, all quotations\nfrom Plato are from the translations included in Plato (1997)). He was\ncertainly very bitter about Socrates\u2019 fate. In his controversial\ninterpretation Strauss (1964) argues that in Plato\u2019s view the\nphilosopher should stay disconnected from society. This interpretation\nis too extreme. Plato did not abandon Socrates\u2019 credo, that the\nphilosopher has a duty towards his fellow-citizens who do not devote\ntheir lives to philosophy. For him philosophy has a civic dimension.\nThe one who makes it outside the cave should not forget about those\nwho are still down there and believe that the shadows they see there\nare real beings. The philosopher should try to transmit his knowledge\nand his wisdom to the others, and he knows that he has a difficult\nmission. But Plato was not willing to go as far as Socrates did. He\npreferred to address the public at large through his written dialogues\nrather than conducting dialogues in the agora. He did not write\nabstruse philosophical treatises but engaging philosophical dialogues\nmeant to appeal to a less philosophically inclined audience. The\ndialogues are, most of the time, prefaced by a sort of mise en\nsc\u00e8ne in which the reader learns who the participants to\nthe dialogue are, when, where and how they presently met, and what\nmade them start their dialogue. The participants are historical and\nfictional characters. Whether historical or fictional, they meet in\nhistorical or plausible settings, and the prefatory mises en\nsc\u00e8ne contain only some incidental anachronisms. Plato\nwanted his dialogues to look like genuine, spontaneous dialogues\naccurately preserved. How much of these stories and dialogues is\nfictional? It is hard to tell, but he surely invented a great deal of\nthem. References to traditional myths and mythical characters occur\nthroughout the dialogues. However, starting with the\nProtagoras and Gorgias, which are usually regarded\nas the last of his early writings, Plato begins to season his\ndialogues with self-contained, fantastical narratives that we usually\nlabel his \u2018myths\u2019. His myths are meant, among other\nthings, to make philosophy more accessible.\n",
