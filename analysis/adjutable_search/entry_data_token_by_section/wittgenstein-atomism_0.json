    "main_text": "Names and Objects\n1. Names and Objects\n\nThe \u201cnames\u201d spoken of in the Tractatus are not\nmere signs (i.e., typographically or phonologically identified\ninscriptions), but rather signs-together-with-their-meanings \u2014\nor \u201csymbols.\u201d Being symbols, names are identified and\nindividuated only in the context of significant sentences. A name is\n\u201csemantically simple\u201d in the sense that its meaning does\nnot depend on the meanings of its orthographic parts, even when those\nparts are, in other contexts, independently meaningful. So, for\nexample, it would not count against the semantic simplicity of the\nsymbol \u2018Battle\u2019 as it figures in the sentence\n\u201cBattle commenced\u201d that it contains the orthographic part,\n\u201cBat,\u201d even though this part has a meaning of its own in\nother sentential contexts. For Wittgenstein, however, something else\ndoes count against this symbol\u2019s semantic simplicity, namely,\nthat it is analyzable away in favour of talk of the actions of people,\netc. This point suggests that in natural language Tractarian names\nwill be rare and hard to find. Even apparently simple singular terms\nsuch as \u2018Obama,\u2019 \u2018London,\u2019 etc., will not be\ncounted as \u201cnames\u201d by the strict standards of the\nTractatus since they will disappear on further analysis.\n(Hereafter, \u2018name\u2019 will mean \u201cTractarian name\u201d\nunless otherwise indicated.)\n\nIt is a matter of controversy whether the Tractatus reserves\nthe term \u2018name\u2019 for those semantically simple symbols that\nrefer to particulars, or whether the term comprehends semantically\nsimple symbols of all kinds. Since objects are just the referents of\nnames, this issue goes hand in hand with the question whether objects\nare one and all particulars or whether they include properties and\nrelations. The former view is defended by Irving Copi (Copi 1958) and\nElizabeth Anscombe (Anscombe 1959 [1971, 108 ff]), among others. It is\nsupported by Tractatus 2.0231: \u201c[Material properties]\nare first presented by propositions \u2014 first formed by the\nconfiguration of objects.\u201d This might seem to suggest that\nsimple properties are not objects but rather arise from the combining\nor configuring of objects. The Copi-Anscombe interpretation has been\ntaken to receive further support from Tractatus 3.1432:\n\nWe must not say, \u201cThe complex sign \u2018aRb\u2019\nsays \u2018a stands in relation R to\nb;\u2019\u201d but we must say, \u201cThat\n\u2018a\u2019 stands in a certain relation to\n\u2018b\u2019 says that aRb.\u201d\n\n\nThis has suggested to some commentators that relations are not,\nstrictly speaking, nameable, and so not Tractarian objects (see, for\nexample, Ricketts, 1996, Section III). It may, however, be intended\ninstead simply to bring out the point that Tractarian names are not\nconfined to particulars, but include relations between particulars; so\nthis consideration is less compelling. \n\nThe opposing view, according to which names include predicates and\nrelational expressions, has been defended by Erik Stenius and Merrill\nand Jaakko Hintikka, among others (Stenius, 1960, 61\u201369;\nHintikka and Hintikka, 1986, 30\u201334). It is supported by a\nNotebooks entry from 1915 in which objects are explicitly\nsaid to include properties and relations (NB, 61). It is\nfurther buttressed by Wittgenstein\u2019s explanation to Desmond Lee\n(in 1930\u20131) of Tractatus 2.01:\n\u201c\u2018Objects\u2019 also include relations; a proposition is\nnot two things connected by a relation. \u2018Thing\u2019 and\n\u2018relation\u2019 are on the same level.\u201d (LK,\n120).\n\nThe Anscombe-Copi reading treats the forms of elementary propositions\nas differing radically from anything we may be familiar with from\nordinary \u2014 or even Fregean \u2014 grammar. It thus respects\nWittgenstein\u2019s warning to Waismann in 1929 that \u201cThe\nlogical structure of elementary propositions need not have the\nslightest similarly with the logical structure of [non-elementary]\npropositions\u201d (WWK, 42).\n\nGoing beyond this, Wittgenstein seems once to have held that there\n can be no resemblance between the apparent or surface forms\nof non-elementary propositions and the forms of elementary\npropositions. In \u201cSome Remarks on Logical Form\u201d (1929) he\nsays: \u201cOne is often tempted to ask from an a priori standpoint:\nWhat, after all, can be the only forms of atomic propositions, and to\nanswer, e.g., subject-predicate and the relational propositions with\ntwo or more terms further, perhaps, propositions relating predicates\nand relations with one another, and so on. But this, I believe, is a\nmere playing with words\u201d (Klagge and Nordman, 1993, 30). A\nsimilar thought already occurs in a more compressed form in the\nTractatus itself: \u201cThere cannot be a hierarchy of the\nforms of the elementary propositions. Only that which we ourselves\nconstruct can we foresee\u201d (5.556).\n\nIt is possible, then, that the options we began with represent a false\ndichotomy. Perhaps Wittgenstein simply did not have an antecedent\nopinion on the question whether Tractarian names will turn out to be\nnames of particulars only, particulars and universals, or whatnot. And\nperhaps he believed that the final analysis of language would (or\nmight) reveal the names to defy such classifications altogether. This\nbroader range of interpretive possibilities has only recently begun to\nreceive the attention it deserves (See Johnston 2009).\n",
