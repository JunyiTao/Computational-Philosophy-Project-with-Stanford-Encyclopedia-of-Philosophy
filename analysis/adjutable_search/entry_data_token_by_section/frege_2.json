Though this notation was first\noutlined in his Begriffsschrift (1879), the most mature\nstatement of Frege\u2019s system was in his 2-volume Grundgesetze der\nArithmetik (1893/1903). Frege\u2019s two systems are best\ncharacterized as term logics, since all of the complete expressions\nare denoting terms. Frege analyzed ordinary predication in these\nsystems, and so they can also be conceived as predicate calculi. A\npredicate calculus is a formal system (a formal language and a method\nof proof) in which one can represent valid inferences among\npredications, i.e., among statements in which properties are\npredicated of objects.\n\n\nIn this subsection, we shall examine the most basic elements of\nFrege\u2019s 1893/1903 term logic and predicate calculus. These are the\nstatements involving function applications and the simple predications\nwhich fall out as a special case.\n2.1.1 The Basis of Frege\u2019s Term Logic\n\n\nIn Frege\u2019s term logic, all of the terms and well-formed formulas\nare denoting expressions. These include: (a) simple names of objects,\nlike \u2018\\(2\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(\\pi\\)\u2019, (b) complex terms\nwhich denote objects, like \u2018\\(2^2\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(3 +\n1\\)\u2019, and (c) sentences (which are also complex terms). The\ncomplex terms in (b) and (c) are formed with the help of\n\u2018incomplete expressions\u2019 which signify functions, such as\nthe unary squaring function \u2018\\((\\:)^2\\)\u2019 and the binary\naddition function \u2018\\((\\:) + (\\:)\\)\u2019. In these functional\nexpressions, \u2018\\((\\:)\\)\u2019 is used as a placeholder for what\nFrege called the arguments of the function; the placeholder\nreveals that the expressions signifying function are, on Frege\u2019s\nview, incomplete and stand in contrast to complete expressions such as\nthose in (a), (b), and (c). (Though Frege thought it inappropriate to\ncall the incomplete expressions that signify functions\n\u2018names\u2019, we shall sometimes do so in what follows, though\nthe reader should be warned that Frege had reasons for not following\nthis practice.) Thus, a mathematical expression such as\n\u2018\\(2^2\\)\u2019 denotes the result of applying the\nfunction \\((\\:)^2\\) to the number \\(2\\) as argument, namely, the\nnumber \\(4\\). Similarly, the expression \u2018\\(7 + 1\\)\u2019 denotes the\nresult of applying the binary function \\(+((\\:),(\\:))\\) to the\nnumbers \\(7\\) and \\(1\\) as arguments, in that order.\n\n\nEven the sentences of Frege\u2019s mature logical system are\n(complex) denoting terms; they are terms that\ndenote truth-values. Frege distinguished two truth-values,\nThe True and The False, which he took to be objects. The basic\nsentences of Frege\u2019s system are constructed using the expression\n\u2018\\((\\:) = (\\:)\\)\u2019, which signifies a binary function that\nmaps a pair of objects x and\ny to The True if x is identical to y and\nmaps x and y to The False otherwise. A sentence such\nas \u2018\\(2^2 = 4\\)\u2019 therefore denotes the truth-value The\nTrue, while the sentence \u2018\\(2^2 = 6\\)\u2019 denotes The\nFalse.\n\n\nAn important class of these identity statements are statements of the\nform \u2018\\(f(x) = y\\)\u2019,\nwhere \\(f(\\:)\\) is any unary function\n(i.e., function of a single variable), \\(x\\) is the argument of the\nfunction, and \\(f(x)\\) is the value of the function for the argument\n\\(x\\). Similarly, \\(f(x,y) = z\\) is an identity statement involving a\nbinary function of two variables. And so on, for functions of\nmore than two variables.\n\n\nIf we replace a complete name appearing in a sentence by a\nplaceholder, the result is an incomplete expression that signifies a\nspecial kind of function which Frege called a concept.\nConcepts are functions which map every argument to one of the\ntruth-values. Thus, \u2018\\((\\:) \\gt 2\\)\u2019 denotes the concept\nbeing greater than \\(2\\), which maps every object greater\nthan \\(2\\) to The True and maps every other object to The\nFalse. Similarly, \u2018\\((\\:)^2 = 4\\)\u2019 denotes the\nconcept that which when squared is identical to \\(4\\). Frege\nwould say that any object that a concept maps to The True falls\nunder the concept. Thus, the number \\(2\\) falls under the\nconcept that which when squared is identical to \\(4\\). In\nwhat follows, we use lower-case expressions like \\(f(\\:)\\) to talk\ngenerally about functions, and upper-case expressions like \\(F(\\:)\\)\nto talk more specifically about those functions which are\nconcepts.\n\n\nFrege supposed that a mathematical claim such as \u2018\\(2\\) is\nprime\u2019 should be formally represented as\n\u2018\\(P(2)\\)\u2019. The verb phrase \u2018is prime\u2019 is\nthereby analyzed as denoting the concept \\(P(\\:)\\) which maps\nprimes to The True and everything else to The False. Thus, a simple\npredication like \u2018\\(2\\) is prime\u2019 becomes\nanalyzed in Frege\u2019s system as a special case of functional\napplication.\n2.1.2 The Predicate Calculus Within Frege\u2019s Term Logic\n\n\nThe preceding analysis of simple mathematical predications led Frege\nto extend the applicability of this system to the representation of\nnon-mathematical thoughts and predications. This move formed the basis\nof the modern predicate calculus. Frege analyzed a non-mathematical\npredicate like \u2018is happy\u2019 as signifying a function of one\nvariable which maps its arguments to a truth-value. Thus, \u2018is\nhappy\u2019 denotes a concept which can be represented in the formal\nsystem as \u2018\\(H(\\:)\\)\u2019. \\(H(\\:)\\) maps those arguments\nwhich are happy to The True, and maps everything else to The\nFalse. The sentence \u2018John is happy\u2019, represented as\n\u2018\\(H(j)\\)\u2019, is thereby analyzed as: the object denoted by\n\u2018John\u2019 falls under the concept signified by\n\u2018\\((\\:)\\) is happy\u2019. Thus, a simple predication is\nanalyzed in terms of falling under a concept, which in turn, is\nanalyzed in terms of functions which map their arguments to truth\nvalues. By contrast, in the modern predicate calculus, this last step\nof analyzing predication in terms of functions is not assumed;\npredication is seen as more fundamental than functional application.\nThe sentence \u2018John is happy\u2019 is formally represented as\n\u2018\\(Hj\\)\u2019, where this is a basic form of predication\n(\u2018the object \\(j\\) instantiates or exemplifies the property\n\\(H\\)\u2019). In the modern predicate calculus, functional\napplication is analyzable in terms of predication, as we shall soon\nsee.\n\n\nIn Frege\u2019s analysis, the verb phrase \u2018loves\u2019\nsignifies a binary function of two variables: \\(L((\\:),(\\:))\\). This\nfunction takes a pair of arguments \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and maps them to\nThe True if \\(x\\) loves \\(y\\) and maps all other pairs of arguments to\nThe False. Although it is a descendent of Frege\u2019s system, the\nmodern predicate calculus analyzes loves as a two-place\nrelation (written: \\(Lxy\\)) rather than a function; some objects stand\nin the relation and others do not. The difference between\nFrege\u2019s understanding of predication and the one manifested by\nthe modern predicate calculus is simply this: in the modern predicate\ncalculus, relations are taken as basic, and functions are defined as a\nspecial case of relation, namely, those relations \\(R\\) such that for\nany objects \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), if \\(Rxy\\) and \\(Rxz\\), then\n\\(y=z\\). By contrast, Frege took functions to be more basic than\nrelations. His logic is based on functional application rather than\npredication; a binary relation is analyzed as a binary function that\nmaps a pair of arguments to a truth-value.  Thus, a 3-place relation\nlike gives would be analyzed in Frege\u2019s logic as a\nfunction that maps arguments \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) to an appropriate\ntruth-value depending on whether \\(x\\) gives \\(y\\) to \\(z\\); the\n4-place relation buys would be analyzed as a function that\nmaps the arguments \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\), and \\(u\\) to an appropriate\ntruth-value depending on whether \\(x\\) buys \\(y\\) from \\(z\\) for\namount \\(u\\); etc.\n",
