    "main_text": "Solving Dynamic Choice Problems || Symbolic Utility\n2.3 Symbolic Utility\n\nAnother strategy for dealing with certain dynamic choice\nproblems\u2014this one proposed by Robert Nozick (1993)\u2014is the\nstrategy of investing actions with symbolic utility (or value) and\nthen allowing oneself to be influenced not only by the causal\nsignificance of one\u2019s actions, but also by their symbolic\nsignificance. According to Nozick, \u201cactions and outcomes can\nsymbolize still further events \u2026 [and] draw upon themselves the\nemotional meaning (and utility\u2026) of these other events\u201d\n(26). If \u201cwe impute to actions\u2026 utilities coordinate with\nwhat they symbolize, and we strive to realize (or avoid) them as we\nwould strive for what they stand for\u201d (32), our choices will\ndiffer from what they would be if we considered only the causal\nsignificance of our actions. Consider, for example, the case of the\nself-torturer. Suppose the self-torturer has moved up ten settings in\nten weeks. He is still in a very comfortable range, but he is starting\nto worry about ending up at a high setting that would leave him in\nexcruciating pain. It occurs to him that he should quit while he is\nahead, and he begins to symbolically associate moving up a setting at\nthe next opportunity with moving up a setting at every upcoming\nopportunity. By the time the next opportunity to move up a setting\ncomes around, the extremely negative symbolic significance of this\npotential action steers him away from performing the action. For a\nstructurally similar but more down-to-earth example, consider someone\nwho loves overeating but is averse to becoming overweight. If this\nindividual comes to symbolically associate having an extra helping\nwith overeating in general and thus with becoming overweight, he may\nbe averse to having the extra helping, even if, in causal terms, what\nhe does in this particular case is negligible.\n",
