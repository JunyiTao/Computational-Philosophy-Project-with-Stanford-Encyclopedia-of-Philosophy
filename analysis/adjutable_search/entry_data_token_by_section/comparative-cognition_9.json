    "main_text": "Eliminating Alternative Explanations || The Role of Non-Epistemic Values\n2.4 The Role of Non-Epistemic Values\n\nPhilosophers have argued that non-epistemic values, such as practical\nand ethical ones, play an important role in science. Such values are\nneeded to evaluate the risk of uncertainty associated with a\nhypothesis (see Rudner 1953; Douglas 2009a). Hypotheses are not\ndeductively entailed by the evidence. Instead, one must determine the\nappropriate trade-off between false positive and false negatives for\nany given test. A test with a high bar for hypothesis acceptance will\nresult in more false negatives, while a test with a low bar for\nhypothesis acceptance will result in more false positives. Determining\nthe right balance between errors often requires taking non-epistemic\nfactors into account. For example, if a false negative has\nconsequences we wish to avoid as a society (e.g., death due to lack of\ntreatment), while a false positive for the same test does not (e.g.,\nthe treatment is harmless and has negligible economic costs), then we\nshould err on the side of the false positive. Of course, often the\ncalculus is not this simple and numerous social and economic factors\nmust be considered.\n\nThe results of comparative cognition research are used to inform laws\nand welfare policies concerning animals. For example, in December\n2013, a group of lawyers, scientists, and policy experts filed a\npetition for a writ of habeas corpus in a New York State Supreme Court\n(Grimm 2013). A writ of habeas corpus is a court order to\n\u201cproduce the body\u201d. It requires any person or institution\nholding a prisoner to bring the captive to court and justify her\nimprisonment and treatment. The writ was filed on behalf of Tommy, a\nmale chimpanzee. At the time of the filing, Tommy was seen living\nalone in a dark shed. If recognized by the court, the writ would\nrequire Tommy\u2019s holder to justify Tommy\u2019s captivity and\ntreatment. This was the first time a habeas corpus had been filed on\nbehalf of a nonhuman animal and, if successful, would represent the\nfirst case of an animal being given the right not to be treated as\nproperty in the United States. The case on behalf of Tommy was made in\npart by drawing on cognitive evidence. The plaintiffs argued that the\ncognitive abilities of chimpanzees are such that solitary confinement\ncauses harm. Numerous comparative cognition researchers and\nphilosophers have testified in support of this case (See\n Nonhuman Rights Project: Client, Tommy (Chimpanzee);\n Andrews, Comstock, et al. 2018). Thus, how we treat and think we\nought to treat animals often depends on our knowledge of their\ncognitive abilities (Bekoff & Gruen 1993). Such knowledge can be\nused to prevent negative states of mind, such as loneliness, anxiety,\nand distress, as well as restore and promote positive mental\nstates.\n\nShould the methods of comparative cognition take non-epistemic values\ninto account? Jonathan Birch (2018) argues that when there are\n\u201cclear policy applications in view\u201d comparative cognition\nresearchers should adjust their standards to reflect the moral\nconsequences of error (2018: 1028). Birch advances a criterion to help\ndetermine when an animal welfare scientist (X) should accept\nthe hypothesis that some species (S) has a mental state\n(M), given a particular policy context (P) (Birch\n2018). Under this view, a welfare scientist should accept that some\nspecies has a mental state in a particular policy context P\nif and only if the expected sum of the possible welfare outcomes given\nthe scientist\u2019s background knowledge and the decision to affirm\nthe hypothesis that S has M in P is\ngreater than the expected sum of the possible welfare\noutcomes given the scientist\u2019s background knowledge and the\ndecision not to affirm the hypothesis that S has M\nin P. One concern with precautionary approaches such as this\none is that it is challenging to agree on where to set the burden of\nproof in any given case. For example, Birch (2017) proposes to set the\nevidential bar for animal sentience at \u201cat least one credible\nindicator of sentience in at least one species of that order\u201d\n(2017: 5). Other researchers, however, have objected that this\nevidential bar is either too weak or too strong. For example, Michael\nWoodruff (2017) argues that this evidential bar is too weak and should\nbe raised to include many more independent indicators of sentience to\ndecrease uncertainty regarding the principle\u2019s level of\nscientific support. In contrast, Rachael Brown (2017b) argues that\nBirch\u2019s evidential bar is too strong for those situations in\nwhich there is no statistically significant evidence of a single\ncredible indicator of sentience, but instead \u201cmultiple, weak,\nbut convergent, lines of evidence that a species is sentient\u201d\n(2017b: 2). Despite these differences, there is general agreement that\nexpected welfare consequences should affect evidential standards in\nthose areas of comparative cognition that have clear policy\nimplications, and that the right evidential standard must be\ndetermined on a case-by-case basis (see also Benz-Schwarzburg,\nMons\u00f3, & Huber. 2020; Crump et al. 2022).\n",
