    "main_text": "The Paradoxes Reconsidered || The Paradox of Constitution\n4.4 The Paradox of Constitution\n\nConstitution is identity, absolute identity. The relation\nbetween the piece of clay \\(c\\) and the statue \\(s_1\\) on day 1 is one\nof absolute identity. So we have that \\(c = s_1\\) on day 1, and for\nthe same reason, \\(c = s_2\\) on day 2. Furthermore, since \\(s_1\\) and\n\\(s_2\\) are different statues, it follows (on the weak view) that\n\\(s_1\\ne s_2\\). In addition, the piece of clay \\(c\\) constituting\n\\(s_1\\) on day 1 is (relatively) the same piece of clay as the piece\nof clay constituting \\(s_2\\) on day 2. (The identity is relative\nbecause we have distinct objects\u2014the two statues\u2014that are\nthe same piece of clay.) It follows that no name of the piece of\nclay c can be a rigid designator in the standard sense. That is,\nno name of \\(c\\) denotes absolutely the same thing on day 1 and on day\n2. For on day 1, a name of the piece of clay \\(c\\) would denote\n\\(s_1\\) and on day 2, it would denote \\(s_2\\), and \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\)\nare absolutely distinct. Nevertheless, a name of the piece of clay may\nbe relatively rigid: it may denote at each time the same\npiece of clay. Although no name of the piece of clay \\(c\\) is\nabsolutely rigid, that does not prevent the introduction of a name of\n\\(c\\) that denotes \\(c\\) at any time (or possible world). (Kraut 1980\ndiscusses a related notion of relative rigidity.)\n\nThere is, however, a certain ambiguity in the notion of a name of the\npiece of clay, inasmuch as the piece of clay may be any number of\nabsolutely distinct objects. The notion of relative rigidity\npresupposes that a name for the piece of clay refers, with respect to\nsome parameter \\(p\\), to whatever object counts as the piece of clay\nrelative to that parameter. This may be sufficient in the case of the\npiece of clay, but in other cases it is not. With respect to a fixed\nparameter \\(p\\) there may be no unique object to serve as the referent\nof the name. For example, if any number of dog parts count, at a fixed\ntime, as the same dog, then which of these objects serves as the\nreferent of \u201cOscar\u201d? We shall leave this question open for\nthe time being but suggest that it may be worthwhile to view names\nsuch as \u201cOscar\u201d as instantial terms\u2014terms\nintroduced into discourse by means of existential instantiation. The\nname \u201cOscar\u201d might be taken as denoting a representative\nmember of the equivalence class of distinct objects qualifying as the\nsame dog as Oscar. It would follow, then, that most ordinary names are\ninstantial terms. (An alternative is that of Geach 1980, who draws a\ndistinction between a name of and a name for an\nobject; see Noonan 1997 for discussion of Geach\u2019s\ndistinction.)\n",
