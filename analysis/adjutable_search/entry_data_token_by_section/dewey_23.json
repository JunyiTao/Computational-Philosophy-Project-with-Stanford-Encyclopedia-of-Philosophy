    "main_text": "Philosophy of Education || Democracy Through Education\n5.3 Democracy Through Education\n\nDewey\u2019s efforts to connect child, school, and society were\nmotivated by more than just a desire for better pedagogical methods.\nBecause character, rights, and duties are informed by and contribute\nto the social realm, schools were critical sites to learn and\nexperiment with democracy. Democratic life consists not only in civic\nand economic conduct, but more crucially in habits of problem solving,\ncompassionate imagination, creative expression, and civic\nself-governance. The full range of roles a child might assume in life\nis vast; once this is appreciated, it is incumbent upon society to\nmake education its highest political and economic priority. During\nWWII, Dewey wrote, \n\n\nThere will be almost a revolution in school education when study and\nlearning are treated not as acquisition of what others know but as\ndevelopment of capital to be invested in eager alertness in observing\nand judging the conditions under which one lives. Yet until this\nhappens, we shall be ill-prepared to deal with a world whose\noutstanding trait is change. (\u201cBetween Two Worlds\u201d, 1944,\nLW17: 463)\n\n\nDemocracy, on Dewey\u2019s view, was much more comprehensive than a\nform of government. \u201cDemocracy\u201d, Dewey wrote, \u201cis\nnot an alternative to other principles of associated life [but] the\nidea of community life itself\u201d (PP, LW2: 328).\nIndividuals exist in communities; as their lives change, needs and\nconflicts emerge that require intelligent management; we must make\nsense out of new experiences. Education \n\n\nis that reconstruction or reorganization of experience which adds to\nthe meaning of experience, and which increases ability to direct the\ncourse of subsequent experience. (DE, MW9: 82) \n\n\nIn other words, the engine of America\u2019s political identity was\ncreative experimentation; in order to fulfill their eventual roles as\nfully participating citizens, students needed education in the habits\n(imaginative, empirical) which made the experimental sciences so\nsuccessful. Dewey called such attitudes and habits\n \u201cintelligence\u201d.[34]\n\nInforming all the spheres just discussed\u2014science, education, and\ndemocratic life\u2014is Dewey\u2019s naturalism which places hope\nnot in what is immutable or ultimate (God, Nature, Reason, Ends) but\nin the human capacity to learn from life. In \u201cCreative\nDemocracy\u2014The Task Before Us\u201d (1939b) Dewey wrote,\n\n\nDemocracy is the faith that the process of experience is more\nimportant than any special result attained, so that special results\nachieved are of ultimate value only as they are used to enrich and\norder the ongoing process. Since the process of experience is capable\nof being educative, faith in democracy is all one with faith in\nexperience and education. All ends and values that are cut off from\nthe ongoing process become arrests, fixations. They strive to fixate\nwhat has been gained instead of using it to open the road and point\nthe way to new and better experiences. (\u201cCreative\nDemocracy\u201d, LW14: 229)\n\n\nThe success or failure of democracy rests on education. Education is\nmost determinative of whether citizens develop the habits needed to\ninvestigate problematic beliefs and situations, to communicate openly,\nthroughout. While every culture aims to convey values and beliefs to\nthe coming generation, it is critical, Dewey thought, to distinguish\nbetween education which inculcates collaborative and creative\nhypothesizing and education which foments obeisance to parochialism\nand dogma. And philosophy must apply this same standard to itself.\n",
