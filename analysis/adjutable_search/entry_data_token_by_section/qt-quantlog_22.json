    "main_text": "Composite Systems\n7. Composite Systems\n\nSome of the most puzzling features of quantum mechanics arise in\nconnection with attempts to describe compound physical systems. It is\nin this context, for instance, that both the measurement problem and\nthe non-locality results centered on Bell\u2019s theorem arise. It is\ninteresting that coupled systems also present a challenge to the\nquantum-logical programme. I will conclude this article with a\ndescription of two results that show that the coupling of\nquantum-logical models tends to move us further from the realm of\nHilbert space quantum mechanics. \n",
