    "main_text": "\n\nThe term \u201cmeaning holism\u201d is generally applied to views\nthat treat the meanings of all of the words in a language as\ninterdependent. Holism draws much of its appeal from the way in which\nthe usage of all our words seems interconnected, and runs into many\nproblems because the resultant view can seem to conflict with (among\nother things) the intuition that the meanings of individual words are\nby and large shared and stable.\n\nThis entry will examine the strengths of the arguments for and against\nmeaning holism.\n",
