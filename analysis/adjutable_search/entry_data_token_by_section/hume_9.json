    "main_text": "Causation || Causal Inference: Constructive Phase\n5.2 Causal Inference: Constructive Phase\n\nHume calls his constructive account of causal inference a\n\u201csceptical solution\u201d to the \u201csceptical doubts\u201d\nhe raised in the critical phase of his argument.\n\nSince we\u2019re determined\u2014caused\u2014to make\ncausal inferences, then if they aren\u2019t \u201cdetermin\u2019d\nby reason\u201d, there must be \u201csome principle of equal weight\nand authority\u201d that leads us to make them. Hume maintains that\nthis principle is custom or habit:\n\n\nwhenever the repetition of any particular act or operation produces a\npropensity to renew the same act or operation \u2026 we always say,\nthat this propensity is the effect of Custom. (EHU\n5.1.5/43)\n\n\nIt is therefore custom, not reason, which \u201cdetermines the mind\n\u2026 to suppose the future conformable to the past\u201d\n(Abstract 16). But even though we have located the principle, it is\nimportant to see that this isn\u2019t a new principle by\nwhich our minds operate. Custom and habit are\ngeneral names for the principles of association.\n\nHume describes their operation as a causal process: custom or habit is\nthe cause of the particular propensity you form after your repeated\nexperiences of the constant conjunction of smoke and fire. Causation\nis the operative associative principle here, since it is the only one\nof those principles that can take us beyond our senses and\nmemories.\n\nHume concludes that custom alone \u201cmakes us expect for the\nfuture, a similar train of events with those which have appeared in\nthe past\u201d (EHU 5.1.6/44). Custom thus turns out to be the source\nof the Uniformity Principle\u2014the belief that the future\nwill be like the past.\n",
