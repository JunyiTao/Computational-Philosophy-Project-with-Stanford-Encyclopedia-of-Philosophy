    "main_text": "An Anatomy of the Debates || Group Selection\n3.1 Group Selection\n\nThe near-deathblow in the nineteen sixties to group panselectionism\nwas, oddly enough, about benefit (Williams 1966). The interest was in\ncases in which there was selection among groups and the groups as a\nwhole benefited from organism-level traits (including\nbehaviors) that seemed disadvantageous to the organism (Wynne Edwards\n1962; Williams 1966; Maynard Smith 1964). The argument was that the\npresence of a benefit to the group was not sufficient to establish the\npresence of group selection. This was demonstrated by showing that a\ngroup benefit was not necessarily a group adaptation (Williams 1966).\nHence, here the term \u201cbenefit\u201d was being used to signify\nthe manifestation of an adaptation at the group level. The assumption\nwas that a genuine group selection process results in the evolution of\na group-level trait\u2014a real adaptation\u2014that serves a design\npurpose for the group. The mere existence however, of traits that\nbenefit the group is not enough to show that they are adaptations; in\norder to be an adaptation, under this view, the trait must be an\nengineering adaptation that evolved by natural selection. The\nargument was that group benefits do not, in general, exist\nbecause they benefit the group; that is, they do not have the\nappropriate causal history (Williams 1966; see Brandon 1981, 1985: 81;\nSober 1984: 262 ff.; Sober & Wilson 1998).\n\nImplicit in this discussion is the assumption that being a unit of\nselection at the group level requires two things: (1) having the group\nas an interactor, and (2) having a group-level engineering-type\nadaptation. That is, the approach taken combines two different\nquestions, the interactor question and the manifestor-of-adaptation\nquestion, and calls this combined set the unit of selection\nquestion. These requirements for \u201cgroup selection\u201d make\nperfect sense given that the prime target was a view of group\nselection that incorporated this same two-pronged definition of a unit\nof selection (see Borrello 2010 for a philosophically-oriented history\nof Wynne-Edwards and his views on group selection).\n\nThis combined requirement of engineering group-level adaptation in\naddition to the existence of an interactor at the group level is a\nvery popular version of the necessary conditions for being a unit of\nselection within the group selection debates. For example, it was\nclaimed that the group selection issue hinges on \u201cwhether\nentities more inclusive than organisms exhibit adaptations\u201d\n(Hull 1980: 325). Another view states that the unit of selection is\ndetermined by \u201cWho or what is best understood as the possessor\nand beneficiary of the trait\u201d (Cassidy 1978: 582). Similarly,\npaleontological approaches required adaptations for an entity to count\nas a unit of selection (Eldredge 1985: 108; Vrba 1983, 1984).\n\nThe engineering notion of adaptation was also tied into the version of\nthe units of selection question in other contexts (Maynard Smith\n1976). In an argument separating group and kin selection, it was\nconcluded that group selection is favored by small group size, low\nmigration rates, and rapid extinction of groups infected with a\nselfish allele and that \n\n\nthe ultimate test of the group selection hypothesis will be whether\npopulations having these characteristics tend to show\n\u201cself-sacrificing\u201d or \u201cprudent\u201d behavior more\ncommonly than those which do not. (Maynard Smith 1976: 282) \n\n\nThis means that the presence of group selection or the effectiveness\nof group selection is to be measured by the existence of nonadaptive\nbehavior on the part of individual organisms along with the presence\nof a corresponding group-level adaptation. Therefore, this approach to\nkin and group selection does require a group-level adaptation from\ngroups to count as units of selection. As with the previous view, it\nis significant that the engineering notion of adaptation is\nassumed rather than the weaker selection-product notion; \n\n\n[A]n explanation in terms of group advantage should always be\nexplicit, and always calls for some justification in terms of the\nfrequency of group extinction. (Maynard Smith 1976: 278; cf. Wade\n1978; Wright 1980)\n\n\nMore recently, geneticists have attempted to make precise the notion\nof a group adaptation though the \u201cFormal Darwinism\nProject\u201d (Grafen 2008), in which the general concept of\nadaptation can be applied to groups (Gardner & Grafen 2009).\nHowever, it is unclear how the notion of adaptation developed within\nthe formal Darwinism project relates to the previously discussed\nengineering notion of adaptation. Philosophers have offered a\ndifferent analysis of group adaptation, one based on an earlier\nanalysis of selection and adaptation (Okasha & Paternotte 2012;\nGrafen 2008). The key distinction, in the original view, is between a\ntrait that is a trait that merely benefits the group, i.e.,\n\u201cfortuitous group benefit,\u201d and one that is a genuine\ngroup adaptation, a feature evolved because it benefited the\ngroup, i.e., \u201cfor the right reason\u201d (Okasha &\nPaternotte 2012: 1137). Contextual analysis, as well as the Price\nequation, can provide a formal definition of group adaptation, but\nboth need to be supplemented by causal reasoning (Okasha &\nPaternoster 2012).\n\nIn contrast to the preceding approach, we can separate the interactor\nand manifestor-of-adaptation questions in our group selection models\n(Wright 1980; see Lewontin 1978; Gould & Lewontin 1979). This is\ndone by distinguishing between what is called \u201cintergroup\nselection,\u201d that is, interdemic selection in the shifting\nbalance process, and \u201cgroup selection for group advantage\u201d\n(Wright 1980: 840; see Wright 1929, 1931). The term\n\u201caltruist\u201d originally denoted, in genetics, a phenotype\n\u201cthat contributes to group advantage at the expense of\ndisadvantage to itself\u201d (1980: 840; Haldane 1932). This earlier\ndebate is connected to the main group selection debate in the 1960s,\nin which the group selectionists asserted the evolutionary importance\nof \u201cgroup selection for group advantage\u201d (Wright 1980).\nThe argument is that the primary kin selection model is \u201cvery\ndifferent\u201d from \u201cgroup selection for the uniform advantage\nof a group\u201d(1980: 841; like Arnold & Fristrup 1982; Damuth\n& Heisler 1988; Heisler & Damuth 1987). There are excellent\nsummaries of the empirical and theoretical discoveries enabled by\n\u201cintergroup\u201d selection models (Goodnight & Stevens\n1997; Wade 2016).\n\nThose supporting a genic selection view in the 1970s were taken to\ntask for mistakenly thinking that because they have successfully\ncriticized group selection for group advantage, they can conclude that\n\u201cnatural selection is practically wholly genic\u201d(Wright\n1980: 841). \n\n\n[N]one of them discussed group selection for organismic advantage to\nindividuals, the dynamic factor in the shifting balance process,\nalthough this process, based on irreversible local peak-shifts is not\nfragile at all, in contrast with the fairly obvious fragility of group\nselection for group advantage, which they considered worthy of\nextensive discussion before rejection. (Wright 1980: 841)\n\n\nThis is a fair criticism of the genic selectionist view. The problem\nis that these authors failed to distinguish between two questions: the\ninteractor question and the manifestor-of-adaptation question. The\nform of group selection that involves interdemic group selection\nmodels involves groups only as interactors, not as manifestors of\ngroup-level adaptations. More recently, modelers following Sewall\nWright\u2019s interest in structured populations have created a new\nset of genetical models that are also called \u201cgroup\nselection\u201d models and in which the questions of group\nadaptations and group benefit play little or no\n role.[10]\n\nFor a period spanning two decades, however, the genic selectionists\ndid not acknowledge that the position they attacked, namely group\nselection as engineering adaptation, is significantly different from\nother available approaches to group selection, such as those that\nprimarily treat groups as interactors. Ultimately, however, genic\nselectionists did recognize the significance of the distinction\nbetween the interactor question and the manifestor-of-adaptation\nquestion. In 1985, for example, we have progress towards mutual\nunderstanding: \n\n\nIf some populations of species are doing better than others at\npersistence and reproduction, and if such differences are caused in\npart by genetic differences, this selection at the population level\nmust play a role in the evolution of the species.\u2026 [But]\nselection at any level above the family (group selection in a broad\nsense) is unimportant for the origin and maintenance of adaptation.\n(Williams 1985: 7\u20138)\n\n\nAnd in 1987, we have an extraordinary concession:\n\n\nThere has been some semantic confusion about the phrase \u201cgroup\nselection,\u201d for which I may be partly responsible. For me, the\ndebate about levels of selection was initiated by Wynne-Edwards\u2019\nbook. He argued that there are group-level adaptations\u2026which\ninform individuals of the size of the population so that they can\nadjust their breeding for the good of the population. He was clear\nthat such adaptations could evolve only if populations were\nunits of selection\u2026. Perhaps unfortunately, he referred to the\nprocess as \u201cgroup selection.\u201d As a consequence, for me and\nfor many others who engaged in this debate, the phrase cane to imply\nthat groups were sufficiently isolated from one another reproductively\nto act as units of evolution, and not merely that selection acted on\ngroups.\n\nThe importance of this debate lay in the fact that group-adaptationist\nthinking was at that time widespread among biologists. It was\ntherefore important to establish that there is no reason to expect\ngroups to evolve traits ensuring their own survival unless they are\nsufficiently isolated for like to beget like\u2026. When Wilson\n(1975) introduced his trait-group model, I was for a long time\nbewildered by his wish to treat it as a case of group selection and\ndoubly so by the fact that his original model\u2026had interesting\nresults only when the members of the group were genetically related, a\nprocess I had been calling kin selection for ten years. I think that\nthese semantic difficulties are now largely over. (Maynard Smith 1987:\n123).\n\n\nEven the originator of the replicator/vehicle distinction also seems\nto have rediscovered the evolutionary efficacy of higher-level\nselection processes in an article on artificial life. In this article,\nthe primary concern is with modeling the course of selection\nprocesses, and a species-level selection interpretation is offered for\nan aggregate species-level trait (Dawkins 1989a). Still, Dawkins seems\nnot to have recognized the connection between this evolutionary\ndynamic and the controversies surrounding group selection because in\nhis second edition of The Selfish Gene (Dawkins 1989b) he had\nyet to accept the distinction made so clearly by group selectionists\nin 1980 (Wright 1980). This was in spite of the fact that by 1987, the\nimportance of distinguishing between evolution by selection processes\nand any engineering adaptations produced by these processes had been\nacknowledged by the workers he claimed to be following most closely\n(Williams 1985, 1992; Maynard Smith 1987). More recently, a related\ndebate has fired up between genic selection and group selection in the\njournals, about the definitions of group and kin selection (E.O.\nWilson 2008; see below). But this debate is bound for nowhere without\ntight enough definitions of these kinds of selection (Shavit &\nMillstein 2008). The adoption of Wade\u2019s strict definitions would\nhelp, following the prescriptions of early group selectionists (Shavit\n& Millstein 2008).\n\nThere has been an even more recent challenge to the received\nunderstanding of kin selection, favoring a group selection\ninterpretation, which has been rebutted by those defending a strict\nseparation between kin and group selection (Nowak, Tarnita, &\nWilson 2010; H\u00f6lldobler & Wilson 2009; rebutted by Gardner,\nWest. & Wild 2011; Abbot et al. 2011). This view, has in turn,\nbeen rebutted by others (van Veelen et al. 2012; Allen, Nowak, &\nWilson 2013; E.O. Wilson & Nowak 2014). Philosophers have offered\na very useful analysis of these debates about kin and group selection\n(Birch & Okasha 2015). The basic prediction of kin selection\ntheory is that social behavior, especially social behavior that\nbenefits others, should correlate with genetic relatedness. This is\ncommonly expressed through Hamilton\u2019s\nrule, rb > c, where\nr is relatedness, b is the benefit that behavior\noffers the conspecific, and c is the cost to the actor (see\nHamilton 1975 for an expansion to multilevel selection). The critics\nclaiming that kin selection is a form of group selection, assert that\nHamilton\u2019s rule \u201calmost never holds\u201d (Nowak et al. 2010:\n1059).\nThat is, it almost never states the true conditions under which a\nsocial behavior will evolve by selection. Their opponents claim the\nopposite: that it is incorrect to claim that Hamilton\u2019s rule\nrequires restrictive assumptions, or that it almost never holds. On\nthe contrary, they claim, it holds a great deal of the time (Gardner,\nWest, & Wild 2011).\n\nOn a philosophical analysis, there are really three distinct versions\nof Hamilton\u2019s rule, and thus three distinct versions of kin\nselection theory under discussion. One involves many substantial\nassumptions, including \n\n\nweak selection, additive gene action, (i.e., no dominance or\nepistasis), and the additivity of fitness payoffs (i.e., a relatively\nsimple payoff structure). (Birch & Okasha 2015: 23) \n\n\nWhen these assumptions are weakened, we get more variants of\nHamilton\u2019s rule. Particularly important are the payoff\nparameters c and b. Sometimes these denote the\nvalues of a particular model, called HRS (Hamilton\u2019s Rule,\nspecial), but other times, they denote averaging effects or partial\nregression coefficients, in the case of HRG (Hamilton\u2019s Rule,\ngeneral). A third approach, HRA (Hamilton\u2019s Rule, approximate),\nwhich uses first-order approximates of regression coefficients, is the\napproach most commonly used in contemporary kin selection theory. The\nspecial version is very restrictive, while the general version allows\na wide variety of cases. According to the philosophical analysis of\nthe cases, Nowak et al. are using the special version of\nHamilton\u2019s rule when they say it \u201calmost never\nholds,\u201d whereas Gardner, West, and Wild are using the\nregression-based, general version of the rule, which allows a great\ndeal of leeway in application. In other words, they are talking past\neach other (Birch & Okasha 2015). Significantly, \n\n\nNeither [Nowak et al. nor Gardner, West, & Wild ] is referring to\nHRA, even though this approximate version of the rule is the version\nmost commonly used by kin selection theorists. (Birch & Okasha\n2015: 24)\n\n\nOn the same philosophical analysis, it is also argued that kin\nselection and multilevel selection represented using the Price\nequation are formally equivalent, and that preferences for kin\nselection models may not be justified as they are usually (Birch &\nOkasha 2015; cf. West et al. 2008). Some\nbiologists, for example, have argued that kin selection is more easily\napplicable than group selection, and that kin selection can be applied\nwhenever there is group selection (West, Griffin, & Gardner 2007,\n2008). Moreover, they deny that kin selection is a form of group\nselection, despite formal similarities and derivations (West, Griffin,\n& Gardner 2007: 424). Problems about using multilevel selection\nmodels may stem from the group beneficiary problem arising from the\nearly group selection context wherein group selection was assumed to\ninvolve both group benefit and group engineering adaptation (Birch\n& Okasha 2015). \n\n\n[A]lthough kin and multilevel selection are equivalent as statistical\ndecompositions of evolutionary change, there are situations in which\none approach provides a more accurate representation of the causal\nstructure of social interaction. (Birch & Okasha 2015: 30; see\nalso Okasha & Paternotte 2012 vs. Gardner & Grafen 2009 on\ngroup adaptations) \n\n\nGeneticists have offered an effective critique of the \u201cFormal\nDarwinism Project\u201d to units of selection and adaptation, arguing\nthat the latter\u2019s preferences for the level of individual\norganism is arbitrary, as is their bias against multilevel selection\n(Shelton & Michod 2014a).\n\nIn an analysis of the contextual analysis and Price equation methods\nof representing hierarchical selection models, it was argued that\ncontextual analysis is superior overall, except in cases of meiotic\ndrive (Okasha 2006). However, it was recently argued that contextual\nanalysis can even handle cases of meiotic drive, thus making it the\nsuperior approach to multilevel selection (Earnshaw 2015). In a\nseparate and helpful analysis, the relationship between kin and\nmultilevel models was spelled out using causal graphs (Okasha 2015).\nJust because the two models can produce the same changes in gene\nfrequencies, it does not follow that they represent the same causal\nstructure, which is illustrated using causal graph theory and examples\nfrom biology, such as group adaptation and meiotic drive (Okasha 2015;\nsee\n Genic Selection: The Pluralists).\n This goes very much against the claims of equivalence of the two\nmodel types, kin and group selection (West, Griffin, & Gardner\n2007, 2008; West & Gardner 2013), in which these technical\nequivalences are taken to signify total equivalence of the\nevolutionary systems (see also Frank 2013; Queller 1992; Dugatkin\n& Reeve 1994; Sober & Wilson 1998). Take, for instance, the\nclaim: \u201cThere is no theoretical or empirical example of group\nselection that cannot be explained with kin selection\u201d (West,\nGriffin, & Gardner 2008: 375),\n\nIt is good to keep in mind that there are dissenters from this claim\nof the equivalence between group and kin selection models (e.g.,\nLloyd, Lewontin, & Feldman 2008; van Veelen 2009; van Veelen et\nal. 2012; H\u00f6lldobler & Wilson 2009; Traulsen 2010; Nowak,\nTarnita, & Wilson 2010, 2011; E.O. Wilson 2012). Those who claim\nfull equivalence discuss the evolution of cooperation and altruism,\narguing that only kin selection allows an easy solution to these\nevolutionary problems (West, Griffin, & Gardner 2008). From the\nmore robust group selectionist point of view, the so-called free rider\nproblems with kin and group selection\u2014such as those that are\ncontemplated by evolutionists puzzling over the evolution of\naltruism\u2014are pseudo-problems based on misconceptions (Wade 2016;\nsee also Bowles & Gintis 2011; Planer 2015; Sterelny 2012).\n\nOne approach notes that kin selection (either in its inclusive fitness\nform or the direct fitness approach) and multilevel selection\n\u201cdiffer primarily in the types of questions being\naddressed\u201d (Goodnight 2013: 1546). Whereas kin selection aims at identifying\ncharacter states that maximize fitness, multilevel selection methods\nhave the goal of looking at the effects of selection on trait changes.\nWhile the two have formal similarities, the kin selection models arose\nout of game theory and evolutionary stable strategies (ESS) and are\nused to identify the optimal solution, but they cannot be used to\nexamine the process by which the population will achieve that\noptimum or equilibrium. In contrast, the multilevel selection methods,\nsuch as contextual analysis, which arise out of the quantitative\ngenetics traditions, are used to describe the processes acting on the\npopulation in its current\n state.[11]\n Thus, the two methods are not the same, nor are they competing\nparadigms. \n\n\nRather they should be considered complementary approaches that when\nused together give a clearer picture of social evolution than either\none can when used in isolation. (Goodnight 2013: 1547; cf. Maynard Smith\n1976; Dawkins 1982b; West, Griffin, & Garnder 2007, 2008; Gardner\n& Grafen 2009)\n\n\nIn the laboratory, the hierarchical genetic approach of multilevel\nselection has been used to demonstrate that populations respond\nrapidly to experimentally imposed group selection, and that indirect\ngenetic effects are primarily responsible for the surprising strength\nand effectiveness of group selection experiments, contra the\nfull equivalence claims (Goodnight 2013; Goodnight & Stevens 1997; cf. West, Griffin,\n& Gardner 2007, 2008). Field studies using contextual analysis\nhave shown that multilevel selection is far more common in nature than\npreviously expected (Goodnight 2013; e.g., Stevens, Goodnight, & Kalisz 1995;Tsuji 1995; Aspi et al. 2003; Weinig et al. 2007; Eldakar et al. 2010;\nWade 2016). There is much less emphasis on the evolution of altruism\nwithin the hierarchical genetic approach, as selection is observed as\nit is occurring, and this includes group selection going in the same\ndirection as organismic selection, not just in opposition to it,\ncontra early genic selectionist recommendations (Maynard\nSmith 1976). This sort of group selection of interactors is not based\non group level engineering adaptations, although some still persist in\nconfusing group selection itself with the combination of the two\nfeatures, group selection and group engineering adaptation (e.g.,\nRamsey & Brandon 2011).\n\nMost recently, a new topic has arisen in the context of multilevel\nselection, involving the evolution of \u201cholobionts,\u201d i.e.,\nthe combination of a eukaryotic organism with its microbiotic load\n(Zilber-Rosenberg & Rosenberg 2008). It has become clear that each\n\u201cindividual\u201d human being is actually a community of\norganisms co-evolved for mutual benefit (Gilbert, Sapp, & Tauber\n2012). Our microbiota (the collection of bacteria, viruses, and fungi\nliving in our gut, mouth, and skin) is necessary for our survival and\ndevelopment, and our species is also needed in turn for their\nsurvival. Bacterial symbionts help induce and sustain the human immune\nsystem, T-cells, and B-cells (Lee & Mazamanian 2010; Round,\nO\u2019Connell, & Mazamanian 2010), as well as providing\nessential vitamins to the host human being. Gut bacteria are necessary\nfor cognitive development (Sampson & Mazamanian 2015), as well as\nfor the development of blood vessels in the gut; lipid metabolism,\ndetoxification of dangerous bacteria, viruses, and fungi; and the\nregulation of colonic pH and intestinal permeability (Nicholson et al.\n2012).\n\nThe holobiont\u2014the combination of the host and its\nmicrobiota\u2014functions as a unique biological entity anatomically,\nmetabolically, immunologically, and developmentally (Gilbert,\nRosenberg, & Zilber-Rosenberg forthcoming; Gilbert 2011). Similarly, a\nholobiont is seen as an \u201cintegrated community of species,\n[which] becomes a unit of natural selection\u201d (Gilbert, Sapp,\n& Tauber 2012: 334). That is, in essence, theorists claim that the\nholobiont can function as an interactor since it has features that\nbind it together as a functional whole in such a way that it can\ninteract in a natural selection process. So what ties the different\nspecies together to produce an interactor? According to pioneering\nphilosophical thought on holobionts and symbionts, it is the\ncommunity\u2019s common evolutionary fate, its being a\n\u201cfunctioning whole,\u201d that characterizes it as an\nevolutionary interactor, \u201cobjects between which natural\nselection selects\u201d (Dupr\u00e9 2012: 160; see also\nDupr\u00e9 & O\u2019Malley 2013; Zilber-Rosenberg &\nRosenberg 2008). This community can also be described as a\n\u201cteam\u201d of consortia undergoing selection (Gilbert et al.\nforthcoming). Others describe\nthem as \u201ccollaborators\u201d or \u201cpolygenomic\nconsortia\u201d, which has the advantage of encompassing both\ncompetition and cooperation within the holobiont (Dupr\u00e9 &\nO\u2019Malley 2013: 314; Lloyd forthcoming; see also Huttegger & Smead 2011 on stag\nhunt game-theoretic results regarding the range of collaboration).\n\nHolobionts can also be reproducers, where the host usually reproduces\nvertically and the microbiota reproduce either vertically,\nhorizontally, or both. This situation has provoked discussion among\nphilosophers (Godfrey-Smith 2009, 2011; Sterelny 2011; Griesemer 2014,\n2016; Booth 2014; Lloyd\nforthcoming). Holobionts\u2019 microbiota can reproduce\noutside the context of the original host organism, so some holobionts,\ne.g., the Hawaiian bobtail squid and its luminescent bacteria, are not\n\u201cDarwinian populations\u201d (Godfrey-Smith 2009, 2011), and\ntherefore not units of selection (see Booth 2014). This approach\ncontrasts with that of the original reproducer approach which would\ninclude the squid-bacteria system and also retroviruses excluded under\nthe \u201cDarwinian populations\u201d account (Griesemer2000a,\n2016). \n\n\nAs in [my book, Darwinian Populations and Natural Selection],\nI hold that it is a mistake to see things that do not reproduce as\nunits of selection. (Godfrey-Smith 2011: 509; Booth 2014) \n\n\nThis exclusion rests on the merging of the interactor with the\nreproducer requirements, and as such will not hold sway over those who\ndo not buy such a confounding of roles (e.g., Dupr\u00e9 &\nO\u2019Malley 2013). This is yet another case wherein distinguishing\nthe interactor question from the replicator/reproducer question can be\n\u201cmore illuminating\u201d (Sterelny 2011: 496; see Dupr\u00e9\n& O\u2019Malley 2013; Gilbert, Sapp, & Tauber 2012; Lloyd forthcoming).\n\nFinally, holobionts can also be manifestors of adaptations, as in the\ncase of the evolution of placental mammals in the acquisition by\nhorizontal gene transfer from a retrovirus of a crucial gene coding\nfor the protein syncytin (Lloyd forthcoming; Dupressoir, Lavialle, & Heidemann\n2012). Syncytin allows fetuses to fuse to their mother\u2019s\nplacenta, a role crucial to the evolution of placental mammals.\nMoreover, it seems that several retrovirally derived enhancers played\ncritical roles in the formation of a key cell in the uterine wall,\nalso crucial for maintaining pregnancy, enhancing the\nholobiont\u2019s role as a manifestor of adaptation (Wagner et al.\n2014).\n\nThere are several other significant entries into the group selection\ndiscussions, including the book, Unto Others: The Evolution and\nPsychology of Unselfish Behavior (Sober & Wilson 1998). Here,\na case for group selection is developed based on the need to account\nfor the existence of biological altruism. Biological altruism is any\nbehaviour that benefits another organism at some cost to the actor.\nSuch behavior must always reduce the actor\u2019s fitness but it may\n(following the work on interdemic selection), increase the fitness of\ncertain groups within a structured population. There was a big benefit\nto bringing the attention of the larger philosophical community to\ngroup selection models, and explaining them in an accessible fashion.\nIt has thus brought this aspect of the units of selection controversy\nout onto the main stage of philosophical thought.\n\nThe \u201cDarwinian populations\u201d view previously mentioned\nprovides a considerably different view of the necessary conditions for\ngroup selection, one which rejects many of the currently accepted\ncases of the phenomenon. For a given selection story to be\ndescriptively valid, a \u201cDarwinian population\u201d must exist\nat the level of selection being described, which requires the presence\nof both an interactor and a reproducer at that level, thus putting\ntogether what others have pulled apart (Godfrey-Smith 2009: 112). A\nDarwinian population is conceived as, at minimum, \n\n\na collection of causally connected individual things in which there is\nvariation in character, which leads to differences in reproductive\noutput (differences in how much or how quickly individuals reproduce),\nand which is inherited to some extent. (2009: 39) \n\n\nThere are further differentiations between paradigmatic, minimal, and\nmarginal Darwinian populations based on a variety of criteria, such as\nthe fidelity of heritability, continuity (the degree to which small\nshifts in phenotype correlate to small changes in fitness), and the\ndependence of reproductive differences on intrinsic features of\nindividuals (Godfrey-Smith 2009: Chapter 3).\n\nFor example, under this view, the case of the evolution of altruism,\nwhich is commonly attributed to group selection, should not be\nconsidered as such, because of the lack of a true reproducer at the\ngroup level; the group level description depicts at best a marginal\nDarwinian population (Godfrey-Smith 2009: 119). Rather, the argument\nis that a neighborhood selection model, in which individuals are\naffected by the phenotypes of their neighbors but cannot be seen as\n\u201ccollectives competing at a higher level,\u201d is fully\ncapable of capturing the selective process involved, and represents a\nDarwinian population, in which the individuals are seen both as the\ninteractors and the reproducers (2009: 118). This would seem to entail\nthat many group selection accounts (e.g., Sober & Wilson 1998), as\nwell as any models classified as Multi-level selection 1 (MLS1) models\n(Heisler & Damuth 1987), cannot be properly considered as such.\nThis view grants that there are empirical examples in which a\ngroup-level reproducer clearly exists (for example, Wade &\nGriesemer 1998; Griesemer & Wade 2000; there is otherwise no\ndiscussion of Wrightian approaches to group selection). The approach\nusing Darwinian populations and reproducers is claimed to present an\nadvantage over other available analyses of units of selection because\nit can account for previously neglected examples such as epigenetic\ninheritance systems (Godfrey-Smith 2009). The question remains as to\nwhether gaining an account to deal with these is worth rejecting an\nentire class of accepted group selection models, and whether such a\nloss is truly necessary to deal with epigenesis, given that we have an\nepigenetic account with reproducers that allows for group selection\n(see Griesemer 2000c).\n",
