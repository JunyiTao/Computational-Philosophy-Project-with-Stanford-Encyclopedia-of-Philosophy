    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Metaphysical Science as of Science of Sovereignty\n4.4 Metaphysical Science as of Science of Sovereignty\n\nAt this point \u2018Abd al-Latif introduces the description of the\nScience of Sovereignty (\u2018ilm al-rububiyya) which echoes\nthat of the first chapter in the Theology of Aristotle: it is\nnot a physical science that limits itself to ascend from effects to\ncauses, but a science which, when it comes close to causes, is able to\ngo back to consider the effects in greater depth approaching the\ndivine knowledge of things.\n\nMoreover, \u2018Abd al-Latif summarizes in the contents, but not in\nthe order, a selection of twenty propositions of Proclus (1\u20133,\n5, 62, 86, 15\u201317, 21, 54, 76, 78, 91, 79, 80, 167, and\n72\u201374: see Zimmermann 1986), four quaestiones of\nAlexander of Aphrodisias (Van Ess 1966; Fazzo & Wiesner 1993) and\nthe adaptation of John Philoponus\u2019 De aeternitate mundi\ncontra Proclum IX,8 and IX,11 (Hasnawi 1994), entitled What\nAlexander of Aphrodisias Extracted from the Book of Aristotle Called\nTheology, Namely the Doctrine of Divine Sovereignty (Endress\n1973). In doing that \u2018Abd al-Latif sets for himself three\nobjectives. In the first place, he wants to stress the crucial aspects\nof the doctrine of the First Cause understood as One, presented in the\nprevious chapters. In the second place, he discusses the relationship\nbetween the One and the many, and, not by chance, he does so after a\nseries of chapters (16\u201320) devoted to the relationship between\nthe First Cause and the world. As for these two objectives, he\nstresses the basic features of the First Cause: it is One and it gives\nunity to that which is multiple; it is One in itself and the True One\nwithout composition; it is the cause of all that which is multiple in\nthat, although it is by essence One, its causal action propagates in a\nmultiplicity of effects; it is above eternity and time; it is life\nthat does not end, light that does not extinguish, it is Pure Being,\nit is the first agent, it is ineffable and nothing can be properly\npredicated of it, it is unknowable, the apex of the hierarchy of being\nwhich is composed of the intellect, intelligible realities, the Soul,\nthe souls, and, finally, the corporeal realities of nature. Then he\nturns to the providence of the First Cause with regard to its effects:\nthis providence exists, is mediated by the spheres and preserves the\nspecies on earth. The divine power acts upon the sublunary world by\ncontact, and, starting from the first sphere of fire, the divine power\nis in matter according to the receptivity of the various matters.\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif ends his presentation of the metaphysical science\nby summarizing the text of the pseudo-Theology from chapter 2\nto chapter 10 (chapter nine is not included), more or less literally\n(Badawi 1955a, Ajoun 2017). Through the\npseudo-Theology\u2014as we have seen before, an item of the\nArabic Plotinus\u2014\u2018Abd al-Latif was exposed to a Neoplatonic\ndoctrine on the causality of the Platonic ideas which took into\naccount the Aristotelian themes of the immobile causality of the First\nMover and the coincidence of the nature of what is the supreme\nintelligent and what is the supreme intelligible. \u2018Abd al-Latif\nwrites about the First Principle, True One, and Creator, which is\nknown only through imperfect images and which is infinite in its\nessence, the process of emanation and the hierarchy from the First\nPrinciple to the word of coming to be, the nature and movement of the\ncelestial bodies which move out of the desire to imitate the\nperfection of the First Unmoved Mover and to assimilate themselves to\nthe Pure Good to the extent to which they are capable; the movement of\nthe first sphere and the life in the world of coming to be; the\nontological anteriority of the First Cause with respect to the\nproximate causes, the ascent of human soul from sensible to\nintellectual knowledge up to the First Principle, which is true\nintellect, true being, true perfection, true science and true\nsubstance. At the end he deals with the limits of our senses and of\nthe human intellect in understanding the First Cause and the others\nseparate beings: our intellect is weak in understanding concepts such\nas movement, time, matter, privation, and possibility, and it can\nattain them only through analogies and long meditation. Moreover, for\nour intellect the First Principle is the condition of knowing without\nbeing known by us, as the sun is the condition of our vision even\nthough we cannot bear the direct sight of it. The Book on the\nScience of Metaphysics ends with the announcement of a treatise\non political philosophy to follow, entitled The Conditions of the\nPerfect State and its Consequences: if people are educated to\ngrew up in virtues, it will be possible to realize al-madina\nal-fadila, the Farabian perfect state.\n\nThis overview of the reception and use of the Greek and Arabic sources\nby \u2018Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi in his Book on the Science of\nMetaphysics proves that, in the framework of al-Farabi\u2019s\nawareness of the manifold nature of metaphysics\u2014ontology,\nknowledge of causes, universal science, and divine science or\ntheology\u2014the return to the Ancients, and to Aristotle, declared\nby \u2018Abd al-Latif to be necessary in his biography, was certainly\nnot a return to the Aristotle of the Greek sources, linguistic access\nto which had by that time been lost for a couple of centuries. Rather\nit was a return to the Aristotle of his own tradition: that strongly\nNeoplatonized Aristotle of the origins of the Kindian\nfalsafa. \u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s treatise on metaphysics\nis in fact deeply rooted in the whole set of Greek works on first\nphilosophy that had been translated or paraphrased into Arabic under\nthe impulse and direction of al-Kindi: in al-Kindi as in \u2018Abd\nal-Latif\u2019s project where the knowledge of the causes comes to\ncoincide with a natural theology that investigates the First\nPrinciple, the De Providentia of Alexander of Aphrodisias,\nProclus\u2019 Elements of Theology, and the last three of\nPlotinus\u2019 Enneads constitute a natural development of\nbook Lambda of the Metaphysics.\n",
