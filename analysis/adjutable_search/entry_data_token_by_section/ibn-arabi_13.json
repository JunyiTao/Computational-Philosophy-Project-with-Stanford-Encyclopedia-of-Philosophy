    "main_text": "Things and Realities || Entification\n4.3 Entification\n\nQ\u00fbnaw\u00ee gave currency to a technical term,\nta\u2018ayyun or \u201centification\u201d, that plays a\nmajor role in discussions of the Reality of Realities among Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s followers. The word is derived from\n\u2018ayn, entity, and it means to become an entity. Given\nthat an entity is a thing, one might translate it as\n\u201creification\u201d, not in the sense of a human cognitive\nprocess, however, but as a designation for the manner in which\nNondelimited Being becomes determined, limited, defined, and\n\u201cthingish\u201d in the process of disclosing itself as\neverything other than God. Thus all things are entifications or\ndelimitations or determinations of the Nondelimited Real, which is\nthen called \u201cthe Nonentification\u201d (al-l\u00e2\nta\u2018ayyun). As for the Reality of Realities, it is the First\nEntification, because all other entifications follow in its wake.\n\nIn her lengthy, though far from complete, study of Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s technical terms, Su\u2018\u00e2d\nal-Hak\u00eem mentions forty synonyms for the Reality of Realities,\nall under the heading al-ins\u00e2n al-k\u00e2mil,\n\u201cthe Perfect Man\u201d. This notion, which can perhaps best be\nunderstood in Western terms as the Divine Logos through which all\nthings are created, stands at the center of Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s worldview and integrates all its disparate\ndimensions. Hak\u00eem does not mention the Third Thing as one of the\nsynonyms, but the continuation of the passage in which Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee speaks of it does make clear that the Reality of\nRealities is indeed the reality (or the fixed entity) of the Perfect\nMan:\n\nMan has two perfect relations, one through which he enters into the\ndivine level, and one through which he enters into the cosmic\nlevel\u2026. He is as it were a barzakh between the cosmos\nand the Real, bringing together and embracing both creation and the\nReal. He is the dividing line between the cosmic and divine levels,\nlike the dividing line between shadow and sunlight. This is his\nreality. So he has nondelimited perfection in both new\narrival and eternity, while God has nondelimited perfection in\neternity and does not enter into new arrival\u2014high exalted is\nHe!\u2014and the cosmos has nondelimited perfection in new arrival\nand does not enter into eternity\u2014it is too base for that! Thus\nman is all-comprehensive. (Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee,\nInsh\u00e2\u2019, 22)\n\n",
