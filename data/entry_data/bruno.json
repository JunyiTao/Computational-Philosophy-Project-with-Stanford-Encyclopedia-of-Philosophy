    "preamble": "\n\nGiordano Bruno (1548\u20131600) was one of the most adventurous\nthinkers of the Renaissance. Supremely confident in his intellectual\nabilities, he ridiculed Aristotelianism, especially its contemporary\nadherents. Copernicus\u2019s heliocentric theory provided a starting\npoint for his exposition of what he called a \u201cnew\nphilosophy\u201d. It disproved the axioms of Aristotelian natural\nphilosophy, notably the idea that sublunary elements occupied or\nstrove to return to their natural places, that is, the elemental\nspheres, at the centre of the cosmos. Concomitantly, it disproved the\nexistence of a superlunary region composed entirely of incorruptible\naether circling the earth and hence disproved Aristotle\u2019s\nprincipal argument for supposing that the universe was finite. The\nuniverse was infinite, animate and populated by numberless solar\nsystems. It was also eternal. As such, it exhibited all possibilities\nat any given moment, and all parts of it assumed all possibilities\nover time, thereby constituting a cognizable manifestation of a\ntimeless and absolute principle, God, conceived as the sole being who\ntruly existed. In keeping with these ideas, Bruno proposed versions of\nmetempsychosis, polygenism, panpsychism and, renouncing Christian\nemphases on human imperfection, advocated a morality that exhorted\nindividuals to perfect their intellectual powers.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life\n\nFilippo Bruno was born in January or February 1548, son of Giovanni\nBruno, a soldier of modest circumstances, and Fraulissa Savolina, at\nNola, about 17 miles north east of Naples. At the unusually late age\nof seventeen, beguiled perhaps by the prospect of a life dedicated to\nlearning, he entered the Dominican convent of San Domenico Maggiore in\nNaples, assuming the name Giordano. In 1572 he became a priest and\nlater that year began to study theology formally, obtaining his\ndoctorate in July 1575. That year he was investigated by his\nProvincial for his views on the Trinity, a delicate topic in\nReformation Europe. This was not the first occasion on which he had\nscandalized his fellow friars and, exasperated with the constraints of\nthe religious life, he fled the convent in early 1576. He went first\nto Rome and then, taking off his habit, proceeded to northern Italy.\nHe was now a fugitive from his order and excommunicate. Over the next\nfourteen or so years he moved from one town or city to another, first\nin Italy and then in France, Switzerland, England, Germany and\nBohemia. In 1591 he returned, fatefully, to Venice. It was during\nthese unsettled years that Bruno composed those Italian and Latin\nworks of his that survive today.\n\nWithout family, connections or means of his own, Bruno relied on his\nwits. For example, at Noli, between Nice and Genoa, he taught Latin to\nschoolboys and elementary astronomy to \u201ccertain gentlemen\u201d\n(Firpo 2000: 45). In Geneva, he worked in a printer\u2019s shop,\ncorrecting proofs. He aspired to greater things. His goal was to teach\nphilosophy without the trammels of revealed truths, preferably at a\nuniversity. On several occasions, a position of this kind seemed\nwithin his grasp. Two factors, however, conspired to thwart his\nambitions. The first was the unsettled circumstances of Reformation\nEurope. At Toulouse, for example, he taught philosophy at the\nuniversity for nearly two years (1579\u201381), but renewed conflict\nbetween Catholics and Huguenots in the summer of 1581 forced him to\nleave the city. His notoriety further complicated matters. In a\ndispatch dated 28 March 1583, the English ambassador in Paris, Henry\nCobham, alerted Queen Elizabeth\u2019s principal secretary, Francis\nWalsingham, to Bruno\u2019s impending arrival: \u201cIl Sr Doctor\nJordano Bruno Nolano, a professor in philosophy, intendeth to pass\ninto England; whose religion I cannot commend\u201d (Aquilecchia\n1995: 22, 24). Not by chance does Bruno have the distinction of being the\nonly known sixteenth-century philosopher to have been excommunicated\nfrom all three major confessions: Roman Catholic (Naples, 1576),\nCalvinist (Geneva, 1579) and Lutheran (Helmstedt, 1589). The second\nfactor was his temperament. Intolerant of those whom he deemed fools,\nBruno repeatedly caused offence. In The Ash Wednesday Supper,\nthe first and best known of the six philosophical dialogues in Italian\nthat he published while living in London, he decried the ignorance and\npomposity of English men of learning and cast aspersions on the London\ncommoner. He compared himself, \u201ca Neapolitan born and bred under\na more benign sky\u201d, with a hapless antagonist at Oxford\nUniversity, whom he described as a discourteous \u201cpig\u201d (BOI\nI, 535). Such was the offence that the work caused that he began his\nnext dialogue, On the Cause, the Principle and the One with\nan elaborate apology in which he retracted his comments while\nsimultaneously justifying them. It was a ploy that he would use again,\nill-advisedly, during his trial.\n\n\nBruno\u2019s wanderings came to an abrupt end shortly after he\nreturned to Italy in late August 1591. After a brief stay in Venice,\nhe moved to Padua for three months or so and then returned to Venice\nto take up lodgings with the Venetian patrician Giovanni Mocenigo, to\nwhom he divulged the \u201csecrets\u201d of his mnemotechnics and\nphilosophy. Alarmed at some of Bruno\u2019s views, Mocenigo denounced\nhim to the Venetian Inquisition on 22 May 1592. Events took a decided\nturn for the worse when, on 12 September 1592, the Papal Nuncio in\nVenice, on behalf of the Holy Office in Rome, requested Bruno\u2019s\nextradition. The Venetian authorities dilly-dallied, before eventually\nacceding to the request in January 1593. At Rome, the trial proceeded\nslowly. Eventually, on 14 January 1599, the Congregation of the Holy\nOffice approved a list (now lost) of eight heretical propositions\nassembled by Robert Bellarmine, S.J., and Alberto Tragagliolo, O.P.,\nfrom the trial records and copies of Bruno\u2019s works. Bruno was\ninvited to consider \u201cwhether he wished to abjure the\npropositions as heretical\u201d (Firpo 2000: 411, 413, doc. 55). Four\ndays later, he was brought before the Congregation and ordered to\nabjure the propositions within six days. Bruno conceded, with\nqualifications, and then submitted a written defence of his views.\n\nThe trial proceeded, with Bruno abjuring the heresies of which he was\naccused, while at the same time taking issue, in written depositions,\nwith aspects of the accusations. It was not, as mentioned above, the\nfirst time that Bruno had used this ploy, turning concession into a\nspringboard for reasserting his position. On this occasion, however,\nthe stakes were higher, as he surely knew. On 21 December 1599, the\ndie was cast when he retorted to the Inquisitors that\n\n\nhe neither needed nor wished to recant, that he had nothing to recant,\nthat he did not have views to recant, and did not know about what he should\nrecant. (Firpo 2000: clxxvi, 463, doc. 65)\n\n\nThe Congregation made a final attempt the same day, sending the\nDominican General and the Procurator, two of the most distinguished\nmembers of the order that he had deserted almost twenty four years\npreviously, to plead with him, in vain. On 20 January 1600, the\nCongregation, with Pope Clement VIII presiding, ordered that all of\nBruno\u2019s works be placed on the Index of Prohibited Books and\nthat he should be consigned to the secular authorities of Rome for\npunishment as an impenitent, pertinacious and obstinate heretic.\nBruno\u2019s final written deposition, addressed to the pope,\n\u201cwas opened but not read\u201d (Firpo 2000: 471, 475, doc. 65a-b). At dawn\non 17 February 1600, he was led out onto the Campo de\u2019 Fiori.\nWith a metal plate clamped over his tongue, Bruno was stripped, tied to a\nstake and, accompanied by the chants of the Confraternity of the\nBeheading of St John, burned alive.\n2. The Wisdom of the Ancients\n\nBruno\u2019s philosophy\u2014despite its inconsistent terminology,\nintricacies, eclecticism and willful contrariness\u2014has an inner\ncoherence. Indeed, he can claim to be the first thinker since\nantiquity to integrate a metaphysics, physics, psychology and ethics\ninto an original, if unsystematically presented, philosophy, one that\naspired to go beyond the reelaborations of Platonism, Aristotelianism\nor scepticism within a Christian context that had hitherto prevailed.\nThe outcome was a radical alternative to medieval and Renaissance\ninterpretations of human nature, the cosmos and God. His philosophy\nremained, however, in one decisive respect a creation of the\nRenaissance: neither celestial nor terrestrial mechanics were\nreducible to mathematical abstractions. His treatment of\nCopernicus\u2019s heliocentric hypothesis, discussed in the following\nsection, exemplifies his approach in this respect.\n\nThe coherence stems from his interpretation of ancient learning. From,\nprincipally, the fifteenth-century Christian Platonist Marsilio\nFicino, he learned of the gentile tradition of wisdom, the\n\u201cancient philosophy\u201d, that had allegedly originated with\nsages such as Zoroaster in Persia and Hermes Trismegistus in Egypt.\nOrpheus, Pythagoras and other early Greek thinkers had imbibed this\nwisdom and transmitted it to Plato, among many others. Through innate\npowers of mind, divine inspiration or direct or indirect knowledge of\nJewish lore, these sages and philosophers had acquired intimations of\nmany, indeed most, of the essential tenets of Christianity. Hence,\nconcluded Ficino, the study of ancient Greek philosophy, especially\nPlatonism, could rightfully serve as a handmaiden to the Christian\nfaith. Bruno denied any such notions of progress. Human knowledge,\nlike all natural things, observed the rule of vicissitude (see\n Section 3),\ngradually oscillating from one extreme to the other. Greek philosophy\nfrom Plato onwards was a debased version of the true wisdom known to\nancient sages such as Hermes Trismegistus among the Egyptians and\nPythagoras, Parmenides and Empedocles among the early Greeks. The\ntask, then, was to restore an authentic ancient philosophy by\nelaborating upon what could be discerned in the few surviving Egyptian\nand Pythagorean records of it with the help of vestigial truths\npreserved in Greek philosophy. Even Aristotle, \u201cthe stupidest of\nall philosophers\u201d, who had done his best to \u201cpervert the\nopinions of the ancients and oppose the truth\u201d (BOI I, 182,\n730), sometimes included, despite himself, valuable ideas gleaned from\nhis predecessors. The many other philosophical sources that Bruno\neclectically pressed into service\u2014Presocratic, Platonic,\nAristotelian, Stoic, Epicurean, medieval, Arabic, scholastic and\nRenaissance\u2014had the same purpose: the articulation of a\nphilosophy true to the principles of an ancient wisdom all but\nobliterated by Aristotle and his followers.\n\nHis approach towards Scripture followed suit. Patristic, medieval and\nRenaissance authors, including again Ficino, held that Hermes\nTrismegistus had lived at the same time as or shortly after Moses.\nThis explained the many similarities between the Old Testament and\nHermes\u2019s writings. Bruno reversed the chronology. He was not the\nfirst Renaissance author to do so, but he was the first to draw out\nthe implications. The daughter of the Pharaoh had taken Moses into her\nhousehold as \u201cher son\u201d (Exodus 2:10, KJV), and he had\nbecome \u201clearned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians\u201d (Acts\n7:22, KJV; BOI II, 369). This \u201cwisdom of the Egyptians\u201d\nwas the wisdom recorded in Hermes\u2019s works. In other words, the\nPentateuch, which conventionally was believed to have been composed by\nMoses, and hence Scripture as a whole were tributaries of Egyptian\nlore, rather than vice versa. Bruno made this point circumspectly, as\nwell he might. Sometimes he disguised his interpretation by referring\nto Scripture as the \u201cKabbalah\u201d. Such wisdom, he declared,\nas there was in the Kabbalah of the Jews \u201cderived from the\nEgyptians, by whom Moses was educated\u201d (BOI II, 362; 369).\nRead literally, this statement was uncontroversial. Though purportedly\nMosaic in origin, the Kabbalah was not an authoritative repository of\nChristian doctrine. By \u201cKabbalah\u201d, however, Bruno\nsurreptitiously meant Jewish lore as recorded not only in the\noriginally oral tradition of the Kabbalah, but also in the parallel\nwritten tradition, that is, the Pentateuch, and hence in the Old and\nNew Testaments generally. The crucifixion was a \u201cKabbalistic\ntragedy\u201d (BOI II, 263).\n\nTravesty though it therefore was for the most part, Holy Scripture,\nlike Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s philosophies, had inherited\nsome truths from pre-Mosaic wisdom. Bruno duly quoted from Scripture\non many occasions\u2014examples feature in the following\nsections\u2014to support his metaphysical, cosmological and ethical\nideas. The Book of Job was especially valuable in this respect. Job\nhad lived in the Land of Uz and so recorded, not Jewish lore, but\n\u201cprofound mysteries of the Chaldeans\u201d (BOL I.2, 390, 418),\nones that, like the wisdom of the Egyptians, the Magi, Orphics and\nPythagoreans, constituted a strand of \u201cthe ancient\nphilosophy\u201d (BOI I, 460). Chaldean wisdom, like that of the\nEgyptians, owed nothing of importance to the \u201cJewish\nKabbala\u201d, which had been composed by a people, the\n\u201cexcrement\u201d of Egypt, who had never governed a land\nof their own (BOI II, 377). Whether these and other aspersions \n(see also BOI II, 438, and\n Section 7), \nstereotypical by his day, represent prejudices discredited by\nobjections voiced by other interlocutors or ones that he shared is a\nmoot point. One way or the other they served to convey his conviction\nthat what truths there were in scripture derived from a philosophical\ntradition that had originated in ancient Egypt.\n\nMedieval and Renaissance philosophers and theologians had,\ndisastrously, held the opposite view. Philosophically, they looked to\nPlato, Aristotle and Averroes as authorities, rather than to Hermes,\nthe Chaldeans, Pythagoras and other early Greek sages. Exegetes had\nconsequently misinterpreted those parts of Scripture that touched on\nphilosophical matters, incorrectly reading literally passages that\ndescribed nature and the universe figuratively and vice versa.\nThis did not dissuade Bruno from adopting scholastic ideas when it suited his\npurposes. He acknowledged the Dominican Thomas Aquinas as an important\ninfluence, praised the metaphysical speculations of thirteenth-century\nOxford Franciscans (e.g., Duns Scotus) and extolled Averroes as a\nbetter commentator on Aristotle than any late Greek commentator,\ndespite the Arab philosopher\u2019s ignorance of the Greek language.\nIt was contemporary scholasticism that bore the brunt of Bruno\u2019s\nanimosity, above all for its emphasis on Latin style at the expense of\nintellectual substance\u2014a vice contracted from Renaissance\nhumanism, for which he had no patience.\n3. Cosmology: The Universe and the Atom\n\nHow and when Bruno began to develop what he called his \u201cnew\nphilosophy\u201d is uncertain (Granada 1990). His earliest surviving philosophical\nwork, On the Shadows of the Ideas, dated 1582, hints at a few\nof its propositions, including heliocentricism (BOL II.1, 7\u20138). The first detailed\nstatement, however, came in The Ash Wednesday Supper,\npublished at London in 1584, in which he set out his interpretation of\nCopernicus\u2019s heliocentric hypothesis, as explained in On the\nRevolutions (1543). Dismissing contemporary claims that\nCopernicus\u2019s hypothesis was merely a convenient computational\ndevice, Bruno announced that it disproved the traditional\nAristotelian-Ptolemaic picture of the cosmos. In the first place, it\ndisproved Aristotle\u2019s doctrine that each sublunary element had a\nfixed \u201cnatural place\u201d at the centre of the\ncosmos\u2014the earth\u2019s globe at the very centre, water in the\nsphere immediately surrounding it, followed by the air and fire\nspheres\u2014and that particles of the elements, if displaced from\nthese natural spheres, had an intrinsic impulse to regain them. On the\ncontrary, since the earth, Bruno explained, was a planet circling the\nsun, the elemental spheres of which it was constituted were\ncontinuously in motion. The elements did not have absolute\n\u201cnatural places\u201d; and an elemental part, whether displaced\nfrom a whole or chancing to be near a whole, sought to attach itself\nto it because a whole was the place where it would be best preserved.\nOnce united with a whole, elemental parts were no longer heavy or\nlight and revolved with it naturally, that is, without resistance.\nThis doctrine of gravity drew on Ficino\u2019s Neoplatonic ideas of\nelemental motion, Copernicus\u2019s doctrine of gravity,\nLucretius\u2019s comments on the weightlessness of parts in their\nwholes and scholastic notions of self-conservation (Knox 2002).\n\n\n\nPeter Apian, Cosmographicus liber (1524, p. 6). The woodcut\ntypifies the medieval and Renaissance picture of the cosmos that Bruno\nsought to discredit. At the centre lies the terraqueous globe,\nunderstood as a combination of the earth and water\nspheres. Surrounding them are the concentric spheres of the other two\nsublunary elements, air and fire. Beyond the fire sphere is the\nsuperlunary region, which comprises: a) seven spheres, each of which\ncarries a planet\u2014the moon, Mercury, Venus, the sun, Mars,\nJupiter and Saturn\u2014around the centre of the cosmos; and b) four\nouter spheres, namely, the firmament (i.e.  the sphere of fixed\nstars), the crystalline sphere, the primum mobile and the\nempyrean. Reproduced by permission of UCL Library, Special\nCollections. \n\n\n\nCommendable though his achievement had been, Copernicus had remained\nunaware of the full implications of his heliocentric hypothesis. It\nwas left to Bruno, the philosopher, to accomplish the full revolution\nof thought, pass beyond the quantitative sensible realm that,\nimportant stepping stone though it was, had unduly preoccupied\nmathematicians like Copernicus and proceed to knowledge of what could\nbe discerned by reason alone (BOI I, 448\u2013454). Copernicus\u2019s most egregious\nshortcoming in this respect was his failure to recognize that his\nheliocentric hypothesis disproved Aristotelian and scholastic\narguments that the cosmos, or rather universe, was finite and\nunique. If the heavens were infinite, these arguments ran, then their\noutermost regions would \u2014impossibly\u2014 revolve infinitely\nfast around the earth at centre of the cosmos. Nor could there be more\nthan one cosmos, because, if there were, then a displaced particle of\nan element would \u2014no less impossibly\u2014have two or more\nnatural places to which it should return. These objections carried no\nweight in a heliocentric world. The apparent daily rotation of a\nfirmament or \u201csphere of fixed stars\u201d around the earth was\nan illusion created by the earth\u2019s rotation around its axis as\nit circled the sun. The universe was not, Bruno insisted, a finite\nglobe composed of concentric spheres, \u201clike an onion\u201d (BOL\nI.2, 261), to use a common simile. Instead it was an infinite,\nhomogeneous expanse populated by an infinite number of solar systems\nlike our own. How far his achievement surpassed that of Columbus, who\nhad discovered just one continent on one earth (BOI I, 451\u2013452)!\nLucretius, Nicholas of Cusa (1401\u201364) and counterfactual\nscholastic discussions concerning the plurality of worlds are evident\ninfluences. The authority that Bruno particularly liked to invoke,\nhowever, was Scripture. The infinite number of celestial bodies\ncorresponded to \u201cthose so many hundreds of thousands [of\nangels]\u201d\u2014an allusion to Daniel 7:10\u2014\u201cthat\nassist in the ministry and contemplation of the first, universal,\ninfinite and eternal efficient cause\u201d (BOI I, 455).\n\n\nThe celestial or, as Bruno called them, \u201cprincipal\u201d bodies\nglided weightlessly within an infinite \u201creceptacle\u201d or\n\u201cexpanse\u201d of aether (BOI II, 110) like specks of dust in\nthe sunlit air (BOL I.1, 262; I.2, 91). What made them move? Their\nsouls. They were animate and, as their orderly patterns of motion\nattested, intelligent too. Aristotle had suggested this among other\npossible explanations for celestial motion. Most patristic and\nscholastic authors, anxious to discourage polytheism, had rejected the\nidea. Ficino\u2019s revival of Platonism, however, had given a new\nlease of life to the idea that the celestial bodies were animate.\nTrue to form, Bruno, though indebted to Ficino on this as on many\nother scores, quoted the Book of Job (28:20\u201321) as his\nauthority. In each solar system or, in Bruno\u2019s terminology,\n\u201csynod\u201d the suns and earth regulated their motions\nautonomously to their mutual advantage. From the earths, the suns\nabsorbed vaporous exhalations. In exchange the sun produced the light\nand heat that the earths, as \u201canimals\u201d, needed in order to\nhost living things. No part of them remained forever barren thanks to\nthe several approximately circular revolutions that they performed.\nNature, for Bruno no less than for Aristotle, did nothing in vain (BOL\nIII, 108).\n\nIn keeping with these ideas, Bruno populated the principal bodies with\nlife-forms of every kind. Each region of each principal body comprised\nmatter which, circumstances permitting, became a plant or animal, even\na rational animal. This last category included human beings and also\ndemons, in other words, rational beings with rarefied bodies made of\npure aether or combinations of aether with air, water or earth. The\nlatter, to judge by the demons frequenting the elemental regions of\nour globe, were generally, but by no means invariably, more\nintelligent than human beings. Within the mountains were dim-witted\ntroglodytes jealously guarding the earth\u2019s mineral veins (BOL I.2, 61, 282; III, 431).\nLong-living but of feeble intelligence, they had little commerce with\nhuman beings. Stone-throwing demons, another species of earthy demon,\nof the kind described by the Byzantine author Michael Psellos, had\nlairs in the vicinity of Nola and habitually pelted those who passed\nnearby at night, as Bruno knew from personal experience (BOL III, 431). Nymphs with\npredominantly aqueous bodies lived secluded in grottos (BOL I.2, 282; III, 181). The variety of\ndemonic life was such that it \u201cfar surpassed that of sensible\nthings\u201d (BOL III, 427, 429). A comparable diversity was evident\namong human beings, who differed in skin colour and stature from region\nto region (BOL I.2, 282, 284). The variations reflected their diverse habitats. When\nextinguished by a cataclysm of some kind, they regenerated\nspontaneously (BOL I.2, 282), in the manner that Avicenna and, if only as a\nphilosophical possibility, some Christian authors had described. The\nnovelty in Bruno\u2019s interpretation was the idea that spontaneous\ngeneration explained the variety of life in an infinite and infinitely\nvaried universe rather than the survival of a privileged species on\nthis earth.\n\nThe principal bodies, human beings and demons were the three genera of\nrational animal inhabiting the universe. In one important respect,\nhowever, principal bodies were unique. Like accomplished\nmusicians\u2014here Bruno adapted an analogy used by Plotinus and\nmany others to illustrate how nature operated non-discursively\naccording to a final cause\u2014they did not think rationally,\nproceeding from one thought to the next as they executed their roles.\nTheir intellects dominated their animal bodies, enabling them to move\nintuitively in accordance with the ends proper to them. Unlike human\nbeings, too, the celestial \u201canimals\u201d were eternal and\nhence did not reproduce, grow or decay. Though corruptible\nintrinsically, they were, as the Chaldeans and Plato had taught,\nsustained by divine providence (for providence, see \n Section 5). \nThis is, at least, what Bruno tended to think even if\nhe conceded, uncharacteristically, that he was uncertain on this point\n(Granada, 2000). In all other respects, the principal bodies were\nanimals like any other. Stones and other parts of our earth, for\nexample, might seem inanimate but, as parts of a principle body, they were, like the bones, nails and hair of an\nanimal, alive, if only vestigially. Like animals, too, the principal\nbodies fed and excreted. They expelled stray particles from the\nsurrounding aether and in compensation emitted others, an idea\ninspired by Lucretius\u2019s concept of simulacra (On\nthe Nature of Things, IV.54\u2013268).\n\nThis picture was incompatible with traditional doctrines of the\nelements. Aristotelian, Neoplatonic and scholastic cosmology distinguished neatly\nbetween the super- and sublunary regions. The superlunary region and\nthe celestial bodies within it were composed entirely of aether. This\n\u201cfifth element\u201d or quintessence was devoid of all change\nother than that of perfect, unending, circular motion. The sublunary\nregion comprised the remaining four elements, fire, air, water and\nearth, which by nature observed finite linear motion upwards or\ndownwards. In addition to finite local motion, bodies composed of the\nsublunary elements continuously underwent generation and\ncorruption. In these respects the superlunary region was superior to\nthe sublunary one. Indeed, even within the sublunary region, according\nto many authors, the four elements were organized hierarchically, with\nearth as the dullest and grossest element at the centre of the cosmos\nand fire as the nimblest and subtlest sublunary element, akin to the\nneighbouring celestial region.\n\nNo such hierarchy could obtain in a homogeneous universe populated by\nanimate suns and earths of the kind that Bruno imagined. Fire, air,\nwater and earth, as they were commonly conceived, were present in each\nand every celestial body, indeed all four were present in each part of\nevery celestial body. Just as in a syllable, each letter was equally\nimportant\u2014an Aristotelian analogy that Bruno turned to his own\npurposes (BOL I.2, 118; Aristotle Metaphysics, VII.17,\n1041b11\u201333)\u2014so too were the elements in the composition of\na body. Timely support came from contemporary accounts of the 1572\nsupernova and theories about comets proposed by Tycho Brahe and others\n(Tessicini 2007, 112\u2013150). The birth of a new star proved that\ngeneration did, after all, occur in the superlunary region. As for\ncomets, they were indeed, as Aristotle and others held, composed of\nthe same elements as other sublunary things but they were not, as they\nhad concluded, sublunary phenomena peculiar to the air and fire\nspheres. Their trajectories proved that were superlunary objects or,\nmore exactly, planets which, owing to the incline at which they\nrevolved around the sun, only intermittently reflected the sun\u2019s\nlight towards the earth. The supposedly sublunary elements occurred in\nthe superlunary region! In short, not only reason but also observation\ndisproved the notion of a cosmos divided into two finite regions of\ncontrasting properties (BOL I.1, 219\u2013221). This was a vivid\nexample of Bruno\u2019s constant refrain that the senses, regulated\nby reason, could be used to advantage (BOI II, 10, 136\u2013137;\nBOL I.2, 196, 218; II.2, 78; Firpo 2000, 57, doc. 11).\n Bruno\u2019s alternative theory of the elements drew on Pythagoreanism,\nancient atomism, medieval discussions, pro and contra, of indivisible\nminims and Nicholas of Cusa\u2019s elemental doctrines (BOL III,\n510\u2013536). Corporeal things comprised two material principles,\nearth and water, and two immaterial ones, spirit and soul. By\n\u201cearth\u201d Bruno meant the discrete, identical, irreducible\nspheres of which physical things were made. He often called them\n\u201catoms\u201d to emphasize their indivisibility. The\ncircumferences and centres of these spherical atoms coincided. Hence,\nas some medieval authors had proposed, atoms were dimensionless\nbodies, unlike the atoms imagined by Democritus and other ancient\natomists. They were, as Bruno said, the principles of spatial\ncontraction, of solidity. Water, by contrast, was a continuum and the\nprinciple of corporeal extension. Two or more atoms, though\ndimensionless, bonded by water constituted a determinate body in\nspace, just as two or more dimensionless points, in Bruno\u2019s\nPythagorean geometry, constituted a line. \u201cThe minimal body or\natom was the substance of all things\u201d (BOL I.3,\n140). Observation confirmed this theory: dry, dusty, earth congealed\nwith the addition of water.\n\nThe two non-material principles, spirit and soul, related to each\nother analogously. Soul, the principle of motion, aggregated atoms and\nthereby determined the identity of a body. Spirit\u2014the\nspiritus popularized by Ficino\u2014was the incorporeal\nmedium through which soul connected with body. Soul accounted for the\nexistence of fire. In its purest form, fire was the combination of\nwater and light, which, as others, including Ficino, had explained,\nwas the physical analogue of the intellectual soul governing all\nthings (for soul and light, see further\n Section 4).\nThis explained why flame resembled water flashing in sunlight: in the\nformer, soul predominated, in the latter, water. The Egyptians Hermes\nTrismegistus and Moses corroborated this idea. Both had understood\nfire to be essentially water (BOL I.1, 376; Genesis 1:6\u20137;\nHermes Trismegistus, Pimander, I.5). Again, in Genesis\n1:1\u20133 Moses had spoken of earth, the water (the\n\u201cabyss\u201d), spirit and light but ignored fire and air,\nprecisely because they were not true elements. Similarly air was a\nderivative rather than, as conventionally believed, an element in its\nown right. Heat generated by fire vaporized water to produce the air\nof the kind that we breath, and this vaporous air merged seamlessly\ninto the empty, dimensionless, space beyond the atmosphere surrounding\na celestial body. This space was the aether, though not the aether of\nconventional cosmology. It was the continuum spread throughout the\nuniverse and through the corporeal things contained in it, binding\nthem together\u2014not unlike the Stoic pneuma interpreted as\nhexis\u2014without, however, moving them. It was, in other\nwords, spiritus, the motionless immaterial medium through\nwhich soul, the principle of motion, operated. As such,\nspiritus or aether was the container\u2014non-terminated\nspace\u2014in which all things were located.\n\nBruno\u2019s elemental theory disproved outright the dominant\nAristotelian view that the universe was finite but infinitely\ndivisible. It also disproved ancient atomism. Democritus, Epicurus,\nLucretius and others had, it is true, correctly surmised that the\nuniverse was infinite and comprised an infinite number of finite,\nindivisible, atoms. But their atoms were solids, although\nimperceptible ones, of various shapes, weights and sizes floating in a\nvacuum, a conclusion that led to a mechanistic view of the universe,\nwhich Bruno did not countenance. Correctly understood, atoms were\nincorporeal spheres with spatial locations. Soul, working through the\nintermediary of aether or spirit, joined these incorporeal, identical,\nspheres to make a body. Indeed, they were not so much components as\ninstances of the universe. Intrinsically dimensionless, their centres\ncoincided with their circumferences. Conversely, since the universe\nwas an infinite, indivisible (atomus) sphere, its centre was\nomnipresent. Both were absolute physical monads, indivisible unities,\nthe centres and circumferences of which coincided. They differed\ninasmuch as the maximum was the \u201cunfolding\u201d of\nthe minimum and a minimum was the\n\u201cenfolding\u201d of the maximum.\n4. The Universal Soul, Universal Intellect and Universal Matter\n\nThe soul that Bruno identified as one of the four principles of\ncorporeality was the World or Universal Soul. The universe was an\norganism in which each principal body and the life sustained on it\nparticipated in a common animating principle, in the same way as the\nmany parts of the human body were vivified by one and the same soul.\nEven supposedly inanimate things had a vestigial presence of life.\nRocks, for example, were alive to the same degree as the bones or\nteeth of animals were. The Universal Soul was\n\u201call-in-all\u201d, that is, present wholly and indivisibly in\neach and every thing to the degree that it was capable of receiving\nit, just as, to borrow Plotinus\u2019s analogy\n(Enneads,VI.4.12), a single voice was audible to everyone in\na room, however great the audience. Bruno, like others before him,\nattributed the doctrine of \u201call-in-all\u201d, in a\ndematerialized version, to Anaxagoras. He also adduced several\nscriptural witnesses, notably the Book of Wisdom (1:7), thereby\nidentifying the Universal Soul implicitly with the Holy Spirit:\n\u201cFor the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world: and that which\ncontaineth all things hath knowledge of the voice\u201d. No matter\nthat the Council of Sens (1140) had anathematized this\nassociation.\n\nThe Universal Soul combined with Universal Matter to produce the\nuniverse; the former was the active power, form, and the latter its\npassive subject. Bruno conceived Universal Matter as indeterminate\nspace, that is, the receptacle of Plato\u2019s Timaeus\n(52A\u2013B) or more exactly Aristotle\u2019s interpretation of it\n(Physics, IV.2, 209b6\u201317; IV.6, 214a12\u201319). In\nthis respect, it was the motionless aether or spirit, devoid of any\n\u201cspecific quality\u201d of its own (BOI II, 159\u2013160; BOL\nI.2 78\u201379), that served as the medium through which soul acted\non the two corporeal principles, earth atoms and water (see\n Section 3). Some philosophers, noted Bruno, called\nthis space or container \u201cvacuum\u201d (BOI II,\n160\u2013161). All Universal Matter was \u201caccompanied\u201d by\nform, that is, the Universal Soul (BOI I, 665\u2013666). This simple\npicture was complicated by Bruno\u2019s interpretation of the\nUniversal or, synonymously, First Intellect. Like the Neoplatonic\nIntellect, Bruno\u2019s Universal Intellect comprised the Ideas; but,\nunlike its Neoplatonic counterpart, it was not a hypostasis distinct\nfrom, and ontologically prior to, the Universal Soul. Instead, it was\n\u201cthe inner and most essential and characteristic faculty\u201d\nof the Universal Soul, operating immanently from within Universal\nMatter like \u201can internal craftsman\u201d (BOI I, 652\u2013654;\nBOL I.2, 312\u2013313, 426; I.4, 107). It did so by articulating its\neffects through division: a seed of a tree became a stem, from which\ngrew branches, from which grew twigs, from which grew buds and so\non\u2014to the point of generating a new specimen through separation\nor discharge of some kind.\n\n\n\n\nThe Universal Intellect was, however, simultaneously separate from the\ncorruptible things that it engendered in that it was immutable.\nSpatial language\u2014\u201cabove\u201d,\n\u201cwithin\u201d, \u201cseparate\u201d and so forth\u2014was,\nas Bruno recognized, inappropriate when describing intelligible\nrealities. By definition, something intelligible had no location or\ndimensions. To clarify what he meant by the immanent and transcendent\nroles of the Universal Soul and its faculty, the Universal Intellect,\nBruno appropriated a distinction formulated in Thomas Aquinas\u2019s\nOn the Principles of Nature. Principles were constituents of\nsomething. The marble of the statue and its form were constituents;\nhence, they were principles, the marble being the material, the form\nthe formal principle. Causes, by contrast, were extrinsic. A sculptor\nwas the efficient cause of a statue, and he made it with an end, a\nfinal cause, in mind. Neither the sculptor nor his purpose were\nconstituents of the finished piece. Analogously the Universal Soul and\nUniversal Matter were the two principles immanent in all things,\nwhereas the Universal Intellect was the efficient cause of all things\nand so extrinsic to them. It also operated in accordance with a final\nand therefore extrinsic cause: the perfection of the universe.\n\nThe Stoics, as Bruno knew, had similarly proposed that the cosmos\ncomprised two mutually dependent principles, the World Soul or\npneuma and matter, active and passive respectively, with the\nformer accommodating Mind. Indeed, when introducing his account of the\nUniversal Soul and Universal Matter in On the Cause, the Principle\nand the One (1584), he included the Stoics among the several\nschools and authors who had identified the World Soul and matter as\nthe active and passive principles of the physical world. Stoic\nphilosophy also contributed to Bruno\u2019s doctrine in surreptitious\nways. In the Pimander (chaps 10\u201312) Hermes Trismegistus\nhad declared that the cosmos was composed of matter and soul and that\nthe latter included Mind. Again, Virgil (Aeneid,\nVI.724\u2013727) had described the super- and sublunary regions as\nanimated from within by spiritus, which Bruno identified in\nthis context with the Universal Soul, and added that they were moved\nby a Mind diffused throughout their vast mass. Hermes Trismegistus and\nVirgil were, according to conventional wisdom, reporting the wisdom of\nthe ancient Egyptians and the Pythagoreans respectively. As such,\nBruno considered them authorities for his interpretation. Neither,\nhowever, was authentic. The comments in the Pimander are just\none of many Stoic borrowings that reflect the eclectic intellectual\nambient of Alexandrian Egypt in which Hermetic works of this kind were\ncomposed. And unbeknown to Bruno, Virgil\u2019s lines drew on Stoic\nrather than Pythagorean thought (Knox 2013).\n\nBruno\u2019s two universal principles resembled Stoic doctrine in\nanother respect. For the Stoics, \u201cfirst matter\u201d was an\nunqualified substance (ousia). For Bruno, too, Universal\nMatter was a substance and in act, not a prope nihil\n(\u201calmost nothing\u201d) of the kind imagined by Aristotle. The\nsimilarities, however, cease at this point. For the Stoics, whatever\nexisted, even soul and matter, was corporeal, capable of acting on or\nbeing acted upon by another corporeal entity. By contrast, neither of\nBruno\u2019s principles was corporeal. The Universal Soul was an\nintelligible reality; and Universal Matter was not corporeal in the\nStoic sense. Inherently qualityless, dimensionless, impassive and\ninactive, Universal Matter was a medium that had the potentiality to\nbecome all things. To explain why Universal Matter conceived in this\nmanner was a substance, Bruno drew on Thomas Aquinas\u2019s\ncommentary on Aristotle\u2019s reportage of ideas proposed by\n\u201cancient philosophers\u201d (Commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Physics, II,\nlectio 2, \u00a71). Wood was a substance in act because it\nwas that from which a bed, stool or image could be made, not because\nit was any one of those things; and the same was true of Universal\nMatter. It was not so much the effects elicited from Universal Matter\nby the Universal Soul\u2019s faculty, the Universal Intellect, which\nwere in act, but rather Universal Matter itself. It was in act by\nvirtue of the unexplicated forms that the Universal Intellect could\nincite from within it, not by virtue of the explicated material forms\nthat it produced. Nicholas of Cusa supplied the language of\nexplication and implication.\n\nUniversal Matter was present in incorporeal as well as corporeal\nthings. It was the genus of two types of matter, corporeal and\nintelligible. The former was the substrate of corporeal objects, as\ndescribed above. The latter, Plotinus\u2019s version of Plato\u2019s\nIndefinite Dyad as reported by Aristotle, was instead the\nsubstrate\u2014the principle of indeterminacy or\npotentiality\u2014of intelligible realities. Bruno quoted two of\nPlotinus\u2019s arguments for the existence of intelligible matter.\nFirst, the plurality of Ideas in the Intellect presupposed something\ncommon to each of them, this commonality being intelligible matter.\nSecond, since the sensible world imitated the intelligible world and\nthe sensible world comprised matter, so too must the intelligible.\nPlotinus, like other ancient Neoplatonists, considered the two matters\nontologically distinct, as Bruno noted. Intelligible matter, as the\nmatter of unchanging intelligible realities, did not change,\nPlotinus had explained. It \u201cpossessed\u201d all things simultaneously. By\ncontrast, the matter of sensible things possessed all things only\ninasmuch as parts of it assumed all possible forms sequentially. Bruno\nadded a differentiation of his own, applying again Nicholas of\nCusa\u2019s distinction between explication and implication:\nintelligible matter was informed but unexplicated, sensible matter was\ninformed but explicated. Nevertheless, Bruno insisted that corporeal\nand intelligible matter were, ultimately, two species of the genus\nUniversal Matter. He was not the first to do so. The eleventh-century\nJewish philosopher, Ibn Gabirol or, in Latinized form, Avicebron, as\nBruno mentioned, had made the same move. Just as importantly, even if\nBruno did not say so, so too had Ficino in accordance with\nAugustine\u2019s Plotinian exegesis of Genesis 1:1\u20133. All\ndistinctions, Bruno concluded, presupposed something indefinite:\npotentiality, matter. Hence the distinction between the two matters\npresupposed an absolute Universal Matter. No doubt he knew of Thomas\nAquinas\u2019s objections. Avicebron was wrong, Thomas had written,\nto say that species were the actualization of a genus\u2019s\npotentialities and so attribute existence to what was a purely\ntheoretical relationship between genus and species.\n\nLike Avicebron, Bruno sometimes went as far as to elevate Universal\nMatter above Universal Form. Nothing was \u201cconstant, fixed,\neternal and worthy of being esteemed a principle apart from [Universal]\nMatter\u201d (BOI I, 686). Form, that is, the Universal Soul, was\n\u201cunder the constant control of [Universal] Matter\u201d (BOI I,\n722). Its stability, which\ncontrasted so favorably with the flux of form, had led the heterodox\nscholastic philosopher David of Dinant (d. 1215) \u201cwho had been\npoorly understood by some\u201d to call matter \u201cdivine\u201d\n(BOI I, 601, 723; BOL III, 695\u2013696). Divine though it might be,\nBruno did not identify Universal Matter with God. Indeed, he\ncriticized Avicebron, misrepresenting him on the by, for having held\nthat matter alone was \u201cstable\u201d, \u201ceternal\u201d and\nhence \u201cdivine\u201d and for vilifying all substantial form,\nincluding the Universal Soul, as \u201ccorruptible\u201d and\nephemeral (BOI I, 687, 696). For Bruno, the Universal Soul was\n\u201cmutable\u201d, rather than \u201ccorruptible\u201d, in\nrelation to Universal Matter and only in this sense inferior to\nit (ibid.).\n5. God and Nature\n\nThe two substances, Universal Soul and Universal Matter, were not\nantagonistic, Manichean. Though opposites, they were aspects of one\nand \u201cthe same principle\u201d (BOI I, 698; BOL I.2, 344) or\n\u201csupersubstantial substance\u201d (BOI I, 557). Since this\nsupersubstantial substance reconciled these and indeed all other\nopposites, it was a \u201cplenitude\u201d without a counterpart\n\u201cnon-being\u201d (BOL III, 40). To explain its unity, Bruno\nturned to Nicholas of Cusa\u2019s doctrine of the \u201ccoincidence\nof opposites\u201d. Universal Matter and Universal Soul/Intellect\ncoincided in an undifferentiated unity just as the circumference of an\ninfinite circle and an infinite straight line, though distinct\nentities, coincided. Not for nothing did Bruno acknowledge that\nNicholas\u2019s doctrine had provided him with the means for reviving\nthe ancient philosophy that had long been \u201cdefunct\u201d (BOL\nI.3, 272). This supersubstantial principle was the God of whom the\nEgyptians Hermes and Moses had spoken. During his trial Bruno asserted\nthat God had created all things from the two principles, \u201cthe\nWorld Soul and prime matter\u201d, from which all things derive.\n\u201cThey depend with respect to their whole being on God, and they\nare eternal\u201d (Firpo 2000, 381 [doc. 51, \u00a7252]). In his\nwritten works, too, he identified them with, respectively, the primordial darkness\nand light described in the first three verses of Genesis (BOL II.3,\n117). This was not as provocative as it might seem. Origen, St\nAugustine and many other theologians had identified God\u2019s first\ntwo creations on the First Day, \u201cheaven\u201d and\n\u201cearth\u201d, with, respectively, intellective beings\u2014the\nangels\u2014and matter.\n\nThis first principle and cause of all things, given its\nsupersubstantiality, was unknowable. We cannot understand God as we\ncan, say, abstract mathematical or metaphysical truths, let alone\nexperience him directly through our senses. Nevertheless, the\nuniverse, mere vestige of him though it is, teaches us a few\nincontrovertible truths. We know, first, that he exists. We can deduce\nthat a sculptor exists when we see a statue, even though we know\nnothing else about him. Similarly, we know from the existence of the\nuniverse that there must be a first principle and cause of all things,\nwhom we call God (BOI I, 646\u2013650). \u201cHe is who is\u201d\u2014a pun on\nGod\u2019s response to Moses\u2019s plea that he describe himself\n(Exodus 3:14)\u2014\u201cfor besides him nothing is\u201d\n(BOL III, 41; similarly BOL I.3, 26). Furthermore, since the universe\nis one, we can tell that God, too, is absolutely simple and the\n\u201cmonad of monads\u201d (BOL I.3, 144 , 146). He was the One\nBeing, the unchanging ens unum, of which Xenophanes and his\npupil Parmenides had spoken. All other things were his accidents or\ncontingent \u201cmodes\u201d (BOI I, 733), just as in arithmetic\nnumbers were composed of, and therefore accidents of, the number one,\nand physical objects were composed of, and therefore accidents of, the\natom. Even the substances Universal Soul and Universal Matter, given\nthey engaged in the flux of things, were accidents of God\u2019s\nsupersubstantial unity.\n\nTrue philosophers, those, that is, who understood that the universe\nwas infinite, could discover more than this. The numberless,\nmagnificent, blazing, celestial bodies revealed, to paraphrase Psalm\n19:1 (KJV), many things about \u201cthe infinite excellence and\nmajesty of their first principle and cause\u201d (BOI I,\n649\u2013650). Together they formed a \u201cpicture, book and mirror\nin which we could gaze upon, read and contemplate the vestige, law and\nsimulacrum\u201d of God (BOL I.1, 203; BOI II, 27). The first of these analogies,\nthat of painting, Bruno developed as follows. A masterpiece relied on\nusing appropriately a range of colours, not just \u201cgold and\nfinest purple\u201d (BOL I.1, 310, 312). Plotinus inspired the\nanalogy (Enneads, III.2.11), but Bruno, as ever, gave\nit a distinctive twist. For Plotinus, it illustrated how the hierarchical\narrangement of all things necessarily entailed a descent from perfect\nbeing to the absence of being, from the absolutely good to the\nnot-good. In Bruno\u2019s philosophy, no such hierarchy existed. Something\nabject was like a splodge of paint which, drab though it appeared on\nthe palette, once applied, lent a painting the desired effect (BOL\nI.1, 312). In other words, accidents that they all were, things\nacquired ontological significance only insofar as they were part of\nGod\u2019s \u201cperfect\u201d image, the universe. As such, the\nlatter was an epiphany incomparably more splendid and revelatory than\nthat proferred by any individual, whether \u201cEgyptian, Syrian,\nGreek or Roman\u201d (BOL I.1, 205). The Syrian that Bruno had in\nmind was Jesus Christ, who was born in Bethlehem and bought up in Nazareth,\nboth towns, as St Luke (2:2) mentioned in his account of the nativity,\nbeing located in what the Roman Empire at the time knew as Syria. It was the\nuniverse, not the first Adam or, as St Paul had called Jesus (1 Corinthians 15:45), the second Adam (Genesis 1:26; 2 Corinthians 4:4; Colossians 1:5; Hebrews 1:3), that was made in God\u2019s \u201cimage\u201d.\n\nCountless theologians and philosophers had proclaimed over the\ncenturies that the perceptible world announced the glory of God. Bruno\nturned the topos to advantage. Only a universe infinite in time\nand extent could fittingly embody what the Apostles\u2019 Creed\ndesignated as his primary attribute, omnipotence. In God and the\nuniverse all possibilities were actualized. Both were infinite and\n\u201call that can be\u201d (BOI I, 602). They differed in that,\nwhereas in the universe all possibilities were at any given moment\nactualized somewhere, in the supersubstantial being, in which form and\nmatter, being and existence, act and potentiality were\nundifferentiated, all possibilities were actualized absolutely without\ndistinctions of time and place. This argument contradicted two\nscholastic convictions: 1) that what was in act physically could not\nbe infinite since infinity was indeterminacy and that consequently an\ninfinite body in act, that is, an infinite universe and specifically\nan infinite animate universe, was an impossibility; and 2) that\nGod\u2019s absolute and ordained power were distinct, that there was,\nin other words, a distinction between: a) the unlimited possibilities,\napart from self-contradiction, available to God by virtue of his\nabsolute power; and b) the limited range of possibilities, that is,\nthose of a finite cosmos, that he freely chose to entertain in his\ndealings with creation (Granada 1994). These arguments, Bruno replied, besides being philosophically incoherent, belittled God\u2019s powers and so undermined \u201claws, religions, faith and morality\u201d (BOI II, 46)\n\nThese two modes of defining God, as the One Being and through his\naccidents, mirrored an important distinction in Bruno\u2019s\nmetaphysics. God had two aspects, one wholly aloof from the universe,\nthe other in communion with it. Precedents were the Neoplatonic\ndistinction between the One \u201cunparticipated\u201d and\n\u201cparticipated\u201d and the Christian distinction between\n\u201cGod hidden\u201d and \u201cGod manifest\u201d (BOI II, 43;\nBOL I.4, 79; III, 41; Isaiah 45:15; Romans 1:19\u201320). The\nChristian God, or more exactly the Word, remained unaltered even as he became miraculously\nincarnated as Jesus Christ. Similarly, Bruno\u2019s supersubstantial God\nproduced the universe, through his supernatural reconciliation of\nnecessity and free will (BOL I.1, 242\u2013247), as Christ-like and\nas his \u201conly begotten\u201d nature (BOI I, 693; BOL III,\n58\u201359; I John 4:9). Bruno used several analogies to clarify the\nrelationship, one of which derived from a passage in Plotinus (BOI I,\n731\u2013732; Plotinus, Enneads, II.6.1) clarifying the\nrelationship of the intelligible and sensible worlds. A single\nsperm\u2014here he followed a common belief\u2014was a complete\nhomunculus, a \u201csubstance\u201d, comprising virtually the arms,\nlegs and every other bodily attribute of a fully grown human being in\nan undifferentiated unity. This substance, this DNA so to speak,\nremained intact with the advent of the body, determining its\n\u201cqualities, differences, accidents and organization\u201d as it\ndeveloped, matured and decayed. Similarly, converting temporal into\nontological priority, the One Being, God, contained intrinsically the\nattributes of the universe in a virtual, unexplicated, mode and, while\nremaining undifferentiated in this mode, also determined in a second\nextrinsic, yet still undifferentiated, mode the differentiations of\nthe explicated universe.\n\nTo explain how God, in his external aspect, articulated these\ndifferentiations, Bruno used Platonic concepts and themes.\nFicino\u2019s Christian Platonism was especially influential. God\nwas a unity or undifferentiated plenitude of Ideas existing in him\nvirtually. In this sense he was Mind. Dependent on him as Mind were:\n(a) the discrete Ideas unified in the Universal Intellect (see\n Section 4); \nand (b) the vestiges of the Ideas, that\nis, forms, which, in combination with sensible matter, produced\ncorporeal things. Further, as Mind, he was also the supersubstantial\nprinciple of intelligence, contemplating the undifferentiated\nplenitude of Ideas within him in one timeless act. Dependent on him in\nthis respect were intelligences of various kinds: (a) the Universal\nIntellect, which contemplated the discrete Ideas simultaneously as a\nunity; (b) disembodied intelligences, known conventionally as\n\u201cseparate intelligences\u201d, which contemplated just one Idea\nabsolutely; (c) embodied intelligences, a category that included the\n\u201cprincipal bodies\u201d, which, though embodied, contemplated\nGod intellectively without the use of sense data and ratiocination,\ndemons and human beings, both of whom used sense data and reason to\nattain intellection, and all other animals, even the\nsimplest. Proof of this were animal instincts, as Ficino, too, had\nnoted. Instincts were the presence of God as Mind working within them\nrather than, as scholastics typically held, powers that the stars\ninstilled in them extraneously.\n\nBruno\u2019s next step was Presocratic rather than Platonic. All\ncognitive acts, in whatever animal or indeed separate intelligence,\nwere instantiations of a single cognitive power deriving from the\nUniversal Intellect and ultimately, therefore, from God as Mind. Bruno\ncited Presocratic philosophers to support this idea and related it to\nParmenides\u2019s concept of the One Being and the accidental nature\nof all things dependent on it. Two unconventional conclusions\nfollowed. First, the form that this single cognitive power took\ndepended on the bodily shape that it inhabited. For example,\ncontradicting Aristotle (On the Parts of Animals, IV.10,\n687a7\u201323), Bruno observed that the hands determined the kind of\nintelligence that human beings enjoyed. Second, no particular bodily\nshape, human, demonic or otherwise, was a privileged outlet for the\nexpression of the single cognitive power. Just as some animals had a\nbetter sense of smell or sight than others, so, too, some were more\nintelligent than others in certain respects. Ants were more\nintelligent than human beings in the way in which they organized their\ncommunal lives (BOL I.4, 119). By means of their individual cognitive powers all\nthings identified how best to preserve themselves and acted\naccordingly. Even supposedly inanimate things observed this principle\nand so showed traces of intelligence. \u201cWhatever exists in some\nway knows in some way\u201d (BOL I.4, 112, 118). A stone held aloft\nsought to return downwards to the earth because that was where it was\nin its optimal condition. It observed the law of gravity (see\n Section 3).\nCollectively the individual cognitive acts of the infinite number of\nthings were the means whereby the Universal Soul/Intellect bound the\nuniverse to its source, God. This impulse to adhere to him\u2014Love\non a cosmic scale\u2014ensured that the universe, having gone forth\nfrom God (his exitus), preserved themselves by their impulse to return to him (his\nreditus).\n\nBruno\u2019s Platonic interpretation of God\u2019s exitus\naccounts for his celebrated dictum \u201cNature is God in\nthings\u201d (BOI II, 354; BOL I.2, 151; I.4, 101). Nicholas of Cusa\nprobably inspired the formula. In a work that Bruno knew, Nicholas\nidentified Plato\u2019s World Soul with Aristotle\u2019s concept of\nNature, before concluding that \u201cthe World Soul or Nature was no\nless than God operating in all things\u201d (The Layman: On the\nMind, XIII.145). Bruno\u2019s comments on God and Nature\nindependently of the dictum agree with this sense. \u201cGod\ndetermined and ordered; Nature executed and produced\u201d (BOL I.3,\n136; similarly BOI II, 660). Nature was the Universal Soul/Intellect\nacting as the efficient cause (see\n Section 4)\n\u201cwithin natural things\u201d (BOI I, 598; BOL II.2, 176). It was the act\nof generation that \u201cdivided\u201d matter (BOI II, 147), operating within it non-discursively, unlike art, as Ficino (Platonic Theology, IV.1) had observed, which operated discursively on material from without (BOI I, 680\u2013682: BOL I.2, 312). The idea that plants and animals were the \u201cliving effects\nof Nature\u201d, that \u201cNature was God in things\u201d, had led\nthe ancient Egyptians to worship images of the gods in the form of\nanimals. Each living thing, in addition to its intrinsic being,\nincorporated something divine from the gods \u201caccording to its\ncapacity and measure\u201d (BOI II, 354\u2013355). The\n\u201cEgyptian\u201d inspiration for Bruno\u2019s comments in this\ninstance was a passage in Ficino\u2019s paraphrase of On the Mysteries of the Egyptians\n(VII.1-3) in which Iamblichus distinguished God as the cause of\ngeneration, Nature, from God in himself.\n\n\nThese and other Platonic borrowings sometimes obscure Bruno\u2019s\noverarching idea of God as the One Being in which two substances of\nequal ontological status, the Universal Intellect and Universal\nMatter, were reconciled. It was, however, only on sufferance that he\nengaged with Platonism. Repeatedly he suppressed Neoplatonic\ndistinctions between one ontological entity and another (BOI I,\n651\u2013653; BOL II.2, 178) or used them instrumentally rather than\nin the conviction that they were philosophically valid (BOL I.4,\n103). Philosophy must aim at \u201csimplicity\u201d (BOL I.3, 236);\nhence his contempt for Francesco Patrizi (1529\u201397), the most\neminent Platonist of the day (BOI I, 676\u2013677). All things were\naccidents of the One Being, intelligibilia included, and hence all\nthings engaged with matter in some respect. Accordingly he denied,\nwith a good dose of sarcasm, Platonism\u2019s central tenet: that the\nIdeas and the intelligences apprehending them were transcendent\nrealities (BOI I, 720-721; BOL I.2, 118, 304, 309\u2013313, 483). In what\nsense could they be outside an infinite universe? Not even the\nseparate intelligences were, in fact, separate absolutely. They\nconstantly illuminated us whether or not we were conscious that they\nwere doing so (BOL II.2, 173)\u2014hence the existence, for example,\nof instincts (BOI II, 455\u2013456). On these grounds, too, Bruno\ndiscounted the notion, in both its original medieval formulation (see\nthe illustration in\n Section 3) and the revised version proposed by the\nmysterious Renaissance thinker known as Marcello Palingenio Stellato\n(c. 1500\u2013c. 1543), that an empyrean\u2014an\n\u201cinfinite\u201d extent of intelligible light, devoid of all\nmaterial connotations\u2014 surrounded a finite, geocentric\ncosmos. Matter and form were inseparable (BOL I.2,\n303\u2013304). Abstract things, wholly separate from matter, were\n\u201cchimera\u201d, no more than logical fictions (BOL I.2, 257,\n309\u2013310). This led Bruno to speak, not of the Universal\nSoul/Intellect shaping Universal Matter, that is, of two distinct\nprinciples or causes, one active, the other passive, but of Universal\nMatter as having the forms inherent within it. To denote them as an\nintegrated unity, he sometimes used the term \u201cNature\u201d (BOL\nI.4,155; BOL III, 266\u2013267, 319). \u201cNature works within\nMatter, or rather it is Matter itself\u201d (BOL I.2, 312). It\ncontained \u201cthe origins of forms of all things within its womb,\nfrom which it brings forth and discharges all things\u201d (BOL III,\n694; also BOI I, 716\u2013717). The universe was like a\n\u201cgastropod\u201d, a living mass endlessly changing in\nconfiguration (BOL I.2, 313).\n\nWe arrive, then, at the intriguing conclusion that Nature, in this\nsecond sense, was God in his extrinsic aspect. \u201cNature is either\nGod or the divine virtue manifested in things themselves\u201d (BOL\nI.4, 101). Given, moreover, that God, despite having an inner and\nouter aspect, was one being, in some sense he must as a whole be\nwithin things. God was separate from us in one respect\nbut, \u201cas the nature of Nature\u201d, was \u201cmore\nintimate\u201d to His effects than Nature itself (BOI II,\n363; similarly BOL I.4, 73; III, 41). Or conversely, God was\n\u201cseparate from all things\u201d in the sense that \u201che was\npresent in them in a more exalted mode\u201d, not in the sense that he was\n\u201cabsent\u201d from them (BOL III, 51). Bruno was, as we have\n seen (see Section 4), wary of applying spatial\nmetaphors to intelligibilia, which were by definition\ndimensionless. Yet, like many a philosopher or theologian before him,\nhe was happy to use them when it suited. God or Mind or Nature was\nboth \u201coutside\u201d and \u201cwithin\u201d all things,\n\u201cabove\u201d them and \u201cbeneath\u201d them,\n\u201cextrinsic\u201d and \u201cintrinsic\u201d, and so forth (BOL I.2, 342;\nI.3, 147; III, 40\u201341, 509).\n\nThe question of whether Bruno\u2019s philosophy was pantheistic\npreoccupied nineteenth- and twentieth-century scholars. Most\nconcluded, often ruefully, that his God remained theistic and\nretained, even if only minimally, an element of the transcendental.\nRegrettably, therefore, he could not be declared unequivocally the\nfounder of modern philosophy, the precursor of Spinoza and Hegel.\nDuring his trial Bruno himself, hoping to reassure his inquisitors,\nemphasized the theistic features of his philosophy. Divine Providence\nwas twofold. It was present in all things, animating them \u201cin\nthe manner that the soul was present in the body \u2026 and this I\ncall Nature, the shadow and vestige of the Divinity\u201d. It was\nalso in essence, existence and power \u201cin everything and above\neverything, not as a part, not as a soul, but in an inexplicable\nway\u201d (Firpo 2000, 67, 303). In his works, too, he emphasized\nthat God governed over all things providentially. Whether his\nphilosophy is pantheistic depends, needless to say, on how we define\nthe term. It shares with Stoicism, which is conventionally considered\npantheist, the view that there was a providential principle, God,\noperating within the universe, that was more than just the\nsum of its parts. Nor does Bruno\u2019s view differ radically from\nSpinoza\u2019s distinction between God as natura naturans\nand the universe as natura naturata, a distinction,\nincidentally, that Bruno knew in its original medieval formulation but\ndid not avail himself of (BOI I, 702). Indeed, it might be argued that\nBruno\u2019s philosophy is more authentically \u201cpantheist\u201d\nthan Spinoza\u2019s, given that the term implies that the cosmos or\nuniverse is divine. Bruno\u2019s philosophy, unlike Spinoza\u2019s\n(Nadler 2016, \u00a72.1), makes this claim in no uncertain terms. The universe\nas the embodiment of God was an object of awe, veneration and\naesthetic delight (BOI I, 453\u2013456; BOL I.1, 203).\n6. The Individual Soul and its Perfection\n\nThe universe was perfect. It could not be otherwise. It was,\nessentially, a bodily manifestation of God. Nothing in the universe, however\n\u201cmean\u201d, was \u201cunconducive to the integrity and\nperfection of what is excellent\u201d. There was \u201cnothing that\nis bad for some things in some place that is not good and optimal for\nsomething elsewhere\u201d (BOL I.3, 272). Philosophers through the\nages had said much the same, as had scholastic authors. \u201cThe\ndeath of a fly\u201d, wrote Thomas Aquinas (Super\nSententiis, lib. 1, d. 39, q. 2 a. 2 co.) \u201cis sustenance\nfor a spider\u201d. Then Thomas added a qualification. Creatures\nnobler than the irrational animals, for example, human beings, have a\nwill, which, the more closely it cleaved to God, was \u201cthe more\nfree from the necessity of natural causes\u201d (ibid.). The cosmos\nprovided the setting for human beings to demonstrate that they merited\neverlasting salvation. For Bruno, however, they were, no less than\nanything else, transient modes or \u201ccorruptible\nsubstances\u201d, in essence, \u201caccidents\u201d of the One\nBeing (BOI I, 664, 729; II, 125, 181\u2013182). They were, as for Spinoza (Ethics, pt IV, prop. 4), part of nature, not a privileged species for which, as Christian doctrine maintained, nature had been created.\n\nHuman beings, understood as combinations of body and soul, perished.\nBut what of their souls? Bruno stated unequivocally that they were\nindividual, that is to say, that they were indestructible,\n\u201catomic\u201d. Death was an illusion, no more than the\ndissolution of an ephemeral conjunction of soul and matter. We should\nawait mutation serenely, not fear death, as Pythagoras, or more exactly Ovid\u2019s \u2018Pythagoras\u2019, had\nrightly observed (Ovid, Metamorphoses, 15.153\u2013175; BOI I, 665). Bruno\u2019s doctrine of metempsychosis required\nhim to uphold the soul\u2019s immortality, even though, as he noted,\nhe interpreted the doctrine differently from Pythagoras, Pythagoreans,\nPlato, Platonists, the Sadducees, Scripture (Psalm 36:6 [KJV]), Origen\nand the Druids. Souls of the dead did not endure a shadowy existence\nin some other world before reincarnation in the manner that the\n\u201cPythagorean\u201d Virgil (Aeneid, VI.743\u2013751)\nand others had described (BOI II, 511\u2013515). That is to say, on\nthe death of one body, a soul did not retain the personality that it had accrued and commandeer another body, like a\nhelmsman changing ships. Rather, we should understand that the soul\nturned its operative powers to forming a new body, the limitations of\nwhich were determined by Providence (BOL III, 257,\n429\u2013430). What made ancient accounts worthy of close\nconsideration was the underlying idea that souls were punished or\nrewarded for their conduct. The One Being, as Providence or Fate,\nensured that, by means of the perpetual change or vicissitude which it\nimposed on natural things, retributive justice prevailed (BOI II,\n180\u2013185, 197, 457\u2013459). A soul that behaved like a pig had\nbeen a pig in a previous incarnation or, on account of its conduct,\nwas doomed to become a pig in the next.  Bruno\u2019s patron in\nVenice, Giovanni Mocenigo, reported to the Inquisition that Bruno had\nonce admonished him for killing a spider.  It may have been, he had\nremarked, the incarnation of a former friend of his (Firpo 2000, 341,\ndoc. 51, \u00a722.179).  In keeping with these convictions, Bruno, inspired\nby Erasmus or perhaps Agrippa von Nettesheim, condemned the\naristocratic obsession with hunting and the customs that it nurtured\n(BOI II, 388\u2013389).\n\nHis doctrine of minims (see\n Section 3) \nexplained the individual soul\u2019s survival of bodily\ndeath. A soul was an incorporeal centre of animation governing the\natoms conglomerating around it as the body grew and flourished. As the\nbody grew older and decayed, the soul contracted its powers inwardly,\neventually dissociating itself altogether from the body. It remained,\nnevertheless, an individual centre of animation capable of forming\nanother body. Insofar, however, as it was disengaged from dimension,\nit \u201cexpanded\u201d seamlessly into the infinite space of the\nuniverse. Or rather, given that infinite space was replete with souls,\nit expanded into the aether or spiritus diffused throughout\nspace. Hence, in the Kabbala of the Pegasean Horse (1585),\none of his most irreligious works, Bruno described an ass who, on his\ndeath, passed into the underworld and noticed there \u201cthat all\nspirits are from the sea of one spirit and that all return to that\nspirit\u201d (BOI II, 450\u2013451). This interpretation of\nspiritus as the unity of discrete individual souls, distinct\nfrom the undifferentiated unity of the Universal Soul, conformed with\nBruno\u2019s elemental theory and definition of space in relation to Universal\nMatter (see\n Section 3).\nScripture, as always, supported his view.\n\n\nWell it is said, too, in Holy Scripture [Ecclesiastes 12:7]\nthat the body dissolves into dust, that is to say, atoms [see again\n Section 3], and that the\nspirit returns to its source [God]. (BOL III, 256)\n\n\nHow could an individual soul endowed with human body, one that encouraged the development of its rational and intellectual potential, ensure a prosperous reincarnation? By turning, as many before Bruno had urged, from the world of sense data\nto the intelligible principles underlying it. From sensibilia the soul\ncomposed intelligibilia by virtue of the intelligible light of the\nUniversal Intellect, in which all souls, as indeed all other things to\nsome degree (see Section 5),\nparticipated. These intelligibilia were \u201cshadows of the\nIdeas\u201d rather than the Ideas of the Universal Intellect\nthemselves. The philosopher\u2019s soul yearned to pass beyond these\nshadows to the Ideas of which the Universal Intellect was the unity\nand so \u201cattune its thoughts and deeds to the symmetry of the law\ninscribed in all things\u201d (BOI II, 557). The final step that he\ncould take was to understand the Ideas, not discretely, but as a\nunity. He came, in other words, to understand the Universal\nIntellect. Given that, following an almost universally accepted\nprinciple going back to Aristotle, intellection entailed the\nidentification of the intellectual subject with the object of\nintellection, the philosopher at this juncture lost his individual\nintellectual identity. He was taken out of himself and, identified\nwith Nature (in the first of the senses mentioned in\n Section 5),\nknew himself as part of the divine presence in the universe. Beyond\nthis, he could not pass. He could discover God\u2019s\n\u201cshadow\u201d, an allusion to Corinthians (I 13:12; II 3:18),\nthat is, \u201cthe world, the universe and Nature that is in\nthings\u201d, the \u201cmonad\u201d that \u201cproceeds from the\nmonad that is divinity\u201d. He could gaze upon this \u201cimage of\n him\u201d, but not his \u201cabsolute light\u201d (BOI II,\n694\u2013697). God as the One Being, both in his inner and external\naspect (see\n Section 5), remained unknowable.\nThe few who aspired to perfection in this way were\n\u201cdivine\u201d, \u201cheroic\u201d, \u201crare\u201d men,\ninspired by \u201ca superior light\u201d (BOI I, 453, 475, 525; II,\n595). These aspirations inspired Bruno\u2019s doctrine of \n\u201clove\u201d in his prose-poem masterpiece, The Heroic Frenzies (Nelson, 1958), and his interpretation of creative genius (BOI II, 528).\nHis art of memory and Llullism, in their\ntheoretical applications, were additional resources in this pursuit of\nself-fulfillment. By constructing a memory palace that mirrored the\nhierarchical structure of the intelligible universe, the soul could\nmove from the accidental multiplicity of the universe to the unity of\nthe Universal Intellect and vice versa (Sturlese 1994). With the same purpose in mind,\nBruno designed and cut the wood engravings of ontological realities\nthat feature, like proto-Jungian mandala, in several of his works.\n\n\n\nGiordano Bruno, \u201cFigura intellectus\u201d, discussed in\nCorpus iconographicum. Le incisioni nelle opere a stampa, ed. M.\nGabriele, Milan, 2001, pp. 374\u2013379; and reconstructed by\nRaymond Kotty at\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAw8thcZsgU\n\n\n7. Religion\n\nMarsilio Ficino, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (in one phase of his\ncareer) and other Renaissance authors had held similarly\n\u201cPelagian\u201d views that philosophy led to self-perfection\nand \u201cdeification\u201d. Yet they had stopped well short of\ndenying the integrity of Christianity. Philosophy and religion were,\nso to speak, two parallel paths, suited to different audiences. Bruno\nhad no such scruples. Philosophy\u2014Bruno\u2019s philosophy of God\nas immanent in an infinite universe as announced in The Ash\nWednesday Supper\u2014was the true bread of life. It\n\u201cilluminated the blind\u201d, \u201cloosed the tongue of the\ndumb\u201d, \u201ccured the lame\u201d, so that the human spirit\ncould once again \u201cprogress\u201d (BOI I, 454). Its powers, that\nis, were miraculous, Christ-like, salvific. By contrast, Christianity\nwas fraudulent. Under a thin veil of irony, all the while denying the\nirony, Bruno praised the various guises under which Christianity\ntaught that ignorance of the natural world led the soul to God. Among\nits many deceits were: scriptural injunctions to acknowledge our\nignorance, notably, the Pauline theme of folly; the ascetic mysticism\nof Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and mystics generally; claims that\nthe light of faith and revelation were superior to human knowledge;\nAugustine\u2019s emphasis on the fallen nature of mankind,\nparticularly the corruption of knowledge innate to it; injunctions to\nbe childlike and meek; and the humility and obedience that the\nChristian clergy sought to instill among its flock (BOI II,\n381\u2013384, 415, 418, 422\u2013430, 443\u2013448; BOL I.2,\n316). The philosopher should ignore these \u201cfoolish dreams\u201d\n(BOL I.3, 200)\u2014in practical as well as in intellectual\nendeavor. To be virtuous was to strive against adversity, to embody a\ncoincidence of opposites. \u201cWhere opposites meet, there is order,\nthere resides virtue\u201d (BOI II, 549). Who deserved praise the\nmore: someone who healed a worthless cripple, or a man who liberated\nhis homeland or who reformed, not a mere body, but a mind (BOI II,\n264\u2013267)? In other words, who was the true savior: Christ or\nBruno?\n\nSimultaneously, with the same indignation that Spinoza and Nietzsche\nwould later voice, Bruno impugned the clerical caste. Living\nparasitically off the labors of others and affecting \u201ca\nfoul-smelling melancholy\u201d, i.e., accidia (BOL\nII.2,189\u2013190; BOI II, 238\u2013239), they advocated the\nsolitary life and renunciation of this world for the next. Such men\nhad extinguished the divine light that had made the souls of the\nancients \u201cheroic and divine\u201d, those very men whom they\ncondemned for their pride (BOI I, 453). If we followed the counsel of\nthese clerics, we would have no temples, no chapels, no hospices, no\nhospitals, no colleges, no universities (BOI II, 238, 267). Of all\npeoples, the ancient Romans had best understood the value of\n\u201cglory\u201d for establishing and maintaining civilization. A\ntrue religion, like that of the ancients, extolled men of action,\nstrength of body and mind and worldly glory (BOI II,\n267\u2013268). Similar comments on clerical duplicity, glory and\nreligion occur in Machiavelli, whose works Bruno probably read.\n\nNevertheless, religion had a role to play. The \u201cuneducated\npopulace\u201d (BOI I, 525; II, 514\u2013515) could not aspire to philosophical\nperfection. They needed laws and sanctions to keep their conduct in\ncheck. Religion, with its promises of reward and punishment in an\nafterlife, served this purpose. When Moses had led the Israelites from\ncaptivity, they were no more than an uneducated rabble. To govern\nthem, he established laws and enforced them with terrifying accounts\nof an almighty, wrathful God who administered retribution in an\nafterlife. Scripture, whether Jewish, Islamic or Christian, had been\ncomposed with this practical goal in mind (BOI I, 522\u2013528). Admittedly, Bruno conceded,\nScripture did sometimes record philosophical truths. Genesis and the\nBook of Job were conspicuous repositories. This was only to be\nexpected, given that Scripture was a tributary of \u201cthe ancient\nphilosophy\u201d (see\n Section 2).\nFor the most part, however, it simplified. Several passages of\nScripture (e.g., Ecclesiastes, 1:5\u20136; Joshua 10:12\u201313)\nimplied that the sun circled the motionless earth. This was a\nsimplification made for the benefit of the uneducated. Disquisitions\nbased on a true, heliocentric, interpretation of celestial motion\nwould have, at best, confused them and, at worst, led them,\ncounterproductively, to dismiss Scripture\u2019s tales of divine\nretribution (BOI I, 522\u2013525).\n\nTo claim that Scripture made allowances for the weak understanding of\nmost men and women was conventional. Patristic, Catholic and\nProtestant theologians acknowledged that Moses had addressed an\nignorant, slavish people and that Scripture spoke in a way that the\nuneducated could understand. All agreed, too, that it focused on moral\nand spiritual issues and refrained from intricate philosophical\narguments. Bruno\u2019s appeal to these positions disguised his\nheterodoxy. The crucial deviation was his denial of miracles, the most\nimportant of all testimonies to the Christian faith. Given that the\nlaws of nature were, essentially, \u201cGod in things\u201d, they\nwere inviolable (BOL I.2, 316). Repeatedly Bruno mocked, allusively,\nthe miracles reported in the Old and New Testament, including those\nperformed by Moses and Christ. Christ\u2019s were bagatelle,\n\u201csleights of hand\u201d (BOI II, 383). They were no\nmore than natural magic, effects produced by manipulating\n\u201coccult\u201d, that is, natural, though imperceptible, forces (BOL III, 427).\nOr, indeed, they may have been the fruits of demonic magic, a comment\nwhich implied that Christ had commerce with demons. Christ began to\nperform miracles, Bruno noted, only \u201cafter his struggle with the\ndevil in the desert\u201d (BOL II.2, 181). The allusive style in\nwhich Bruno disguised his views only served to accentuate his\nblasphemies, mixing as they did ridicule and contempt with heresy.\nHandwritten annotations in copies of his works show that\ncontemporaries or near contemporaries recognized his intentions easily\nenough.\n\nPhilosophers, \u201cheroes\u201d, did not need Scripture\u2019s\nbogus threats of retribution and promises of future rewards to cajole\nthem into behaving morally. They understood the \u201cpattern\u201d\n(istoria) of Nature inscribed within [them]\u2019 (BOI II,\n24\u201325), that God, in other words, was with and within them (BOI\nI, 455\u2013456; II, 658), and governed their actions\naccordingly. Those who considered the matter carefully, \u201ctruly\nreligious men\u201d, \u201cmen who were good by nature\u201d, would\nsee that Bruno\u2019s philosophy, more than any other, \u201cnot\nonly contained the truth but also favoured religion\u201d (BOI I,\n528). They did not need rituals involving some \u201cfood and\ndrink\u201d to revere the divine (BOL I.1, 205). On diverse\noccasions, he covertly mocked the eucharist, despising as he did the\n\u201csubtleties\u201d of scholastic accounts of transubstantiation\n(Spampanato 1933, 40). Instead, it was the majesty of Nature, the\ninfinite animate universe, that inspired the wonder and reverence of\ntruly divine men and led them to search for its cause (see\n Section 5).  In so doing they became\nthemselves \u201cgreater than those gods whom blind commoners\nworship\u201d (BOI II, 24). Stripped, in short, of its false claims,\nChristianity could be seen for what it was, a \u201cfoolish faith and\nblind credulity\u201d (BOI II, 386, 398), \u201ca wretched\nstory\u201d (BOL I.2, 172), \u201ca worthless, pernicious\nfable\u201d (BOI II, 400), a continuation of Judaism, a religion\ninvented by that \u201cpestilent, leprous and wholly\npernicious\u201d race, the Jews (BOI II, 314\u2013315; for similar\nstereotypical anti-Jewish comments, see Section\n2 and the caveat there regarding the extent to which they reflect\nBruno\u2019s views). With its threats that the world would end and\nits stories of a God who wrought miracles at whim, it had cowed a\n\u201cstupefied\u201d world into despising Nature\u2014\u201cGod\nin things\u201d\u2014and, \u201chaving smashed the tables of\nNature\u201d (cf. Exodus, 32:19), looked forward joyfully to the ruin\nof all things (BOL I.2 123).\n\nBruno\u2019s several clashes with ecclesiastical authorities testify\nto his impatience with Christianity of whatever shade. The sectarian\nviolence that plagued the sixteenth century plainly showed that it had\ndone the very opposite of what religion should do, \u201cbind\u201d\nmen and women together, an allusion to an etymological derivation of\nthe Latin word religio from religo, \u201cI\nbind\u201d, commonly invoked by Latin authors of all periods (BOL\nII.2, 181). There are, however, many indications that Bruno found\nProtestantism the more irksome variant. Above all Protestants\u2019\ndenial of the efficacy of \u201cgood works\u201d and free will and,\nconversely, their emphasis on the inner spirit, predestination and\njustification through \u201cfaith alone\u201d, were unconducive to\ncivil order, political stability and material prosperity. At several\npoints Bruno\u2019s turn of phrase suggests that his attack on\nProtestant theology was directed in the first instance against\nLuther\u2019s On the Bondage of the Will (1525) and that, in\nformulating his riposte, he drew on Erasmus\u2019s On Free\nWill (1524), the work that had prompted Luther to write his\ntreatise in the first place.\n8. Bruno\u2019s Afterlife\n\nBruno\u2019s philosophy, his views on religion and his execution\nearned him notoriety. \u201cIt is reasonable to denounce\nBruno\u201d, wrote the French mathematician, philosopher and\ntheologian Marin Mersenne (1588\u20131648), \u201cas one of the most\nevil men that the earth has ever borne\u201d (Mersenne 1624\n[2005, 173]). What perturbed Mersenne and many others, including\nDescartes, was not so much Bruno\u2019s doctrines concerning the\nearth\u2019s mobility, the elemental homogeneity of the universe, the\nplurality of worlds and other cosmological innovations, but rather the\nunderlying doctrine of the World Soul and its perceived corollaries:\npantheism, demonology, magic, metempsychosis, the claim that\nGod\u2019s absolute power necessitated an infinite product, the\nessential identity of human, plant and animal souls, the elimination\nof individual responsibility, denial of miracles\u2014in short,\n\u201catheism\u201d.\n\nDemonizing Bruno lent him, however, a certain fascination. To his\ndismay, Mersenne observed that some of his compatriots amused\nthemselves by reading his On the Cause, the Principle and the\nOne. During the course of the seventeenth century, his ideas\ncontinued to appeal to libertines, Rosicrucians and other unorthodox\nthinkers, despite, or perhaps because of, the censures of conventional\ntheologians and philosophers. In his Oculus sidereus\n(Starry Gaze), published at Danzig in 1644, the Rosicrucian\nAbraham von Franckenberg (1593\u20131652), a pupil of Jacob\nB\u00f6hme, included a synopsis, the first to be printed, of De\nimmenso (originally published in 1591) relating its ideas to\nthose of ancient and Renaissance authors. Bruno\u2019s space, wrote\nFranckenberg, was the Kabbalists\u2019 \u201cGod as space\u201d,\ntheir Ensoph, the first of the ten Sephiroth (Ricci 1990,\n137\u2013152). In England and on the Continent, John Toland\nchampioned Bruno\u2019s philosophy, incurring the disapproval of\nLeibniz and others. Leibniz\u2019s early enthusiasm for Bruno had worn off; and the striking similarities between aspects of Leibniz\u2019s monadology and Bruno\u2019s doctrine of minims are probably attributable to the sources and philosophical interests that they shared in common, rather than direct influence (Brown 2002). Among the seventeenth-century champions of\nheliocentricism, Johannes Kepler, averse though he was to\nBruno\u2019s suggestion that the universe was infinite and his\napparent conflation of God and matter, engaged circumspectly with his\ncosmological ideas on several occasions, particularly through the\nintermediary of the Imperial Counsellor to Rudolph II, Wacker von\nWackenfels, an enthusiast of Bruno\u2019s cosmology (Ricci 1990,\n68\u201379; Granada 2008). In private conversation, Kepler, the newly\nappointed Imperial Mathematician, chided Galileo for not having\nacknowledged the contribution that others, including Bruno and\nhimself, had made to the novelties recorded in his\nStarry Messenger, published in 1610 (Hasdale 1610).\n\nInterest in Bruno\u2019s philosophy remained, nevertheless, sporadic.\nCopies of his works were hard to come by and, for the most part, the\nideas in them remained curiosities, outlined in encyclopedias and\nhistories of philosophy, such as those of Pierre Bayle and J. J.\nBrucker, with cautionary remarks about his extravagant, wayward,\ngenius. More than any other philosopher, Bruno proved \u201cthat\noften the greater the power of intellect, the less judgement there\nis\u201d (Brucker 1776\u201377: IV.2, 30). \u201cGold\u201d there\nwas to be discovered, but it lay concealed within the\n\u201cdung\u201d of his confused thinking (ibid., 31). What changed\nBruno\u2019s fortunes decisively was the advent of\n\u201cSpinozism\u201d. The similarities between Bruno\u2019s and\nSpinoza\u2019s substance monism had long been noticed. Bayle, no\nadmirer of Spinoza, pointed them out, as did Mathurin Veyssi\u00e8re\nde Lacroze by way of denigrating Bruno as an \u201catheist\u201d\n(Veyssi\u00e8re de Lacroz 1711, 284\u2013325). Brucker conceded that\nthere were some resemblances but concluded that Bruno did not merit\nthe charge of \u201cSpinozism\u201d (ibid., 52), arguing that, for\nBruno, the universe emanated from, rather than was identical with, God\n(see\n Section 5).\nThen, spectacularly, in the second half the eighteenth century Bruno\npassed from being a heinous atheist to, in Herder\u2019s estimation,\nsomeone comparable to, indeed \u201cundoubtedly still more\ndivine\u201d than St John (McFarland 1969, 77). The key moment was\nthe publication in 1785 of F. H. Jacobi\u2019s On the Doctrine of\nSpinoza in Letters to Herr Moses Mendelssohn, in which Jacobi,\nwithout Mendelssohn\u2019s consent, published an exchange of letters\nbetween them concerning Lessing\u2019s alleged\n\u201cSpinozism\u201d and Spinoza\u2019s philosophy more generally.\nJacobi, an opponent of Enlightenment rationalism, praised\nSpinoza\u2019s philosophy, in the \u201cpurified\u201d form\nproposed by some exponents, as an exemplary manifestation of what pure\nreason, left to its own devices, could achieve. Equally, however, it\nmanifested the limitations of reason, more specifically rational\ntheism. It led essentially to materialism, fatalism and atheism. In\n1789, Jacobi issued an expanded edition of his work, which included,\nin a new preface, a brief discussion of Bruno and his monism and, in\nan appendix, a German paraphrase of On the Cause, the Principle\nand the One together with an extended quotation from the second\ndialogue in the original Italian. His purpose in combining Spinoza and\nBruno was to provide \u201ca summa of the philosophy of the\n\u1f13\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u1f71\u03bd\u201d, a reference\nto Lessing\u2019s \u201cpantheist\u201d theology as well as an\nallusion to Heraclitus\u2019s monism. \u201cIt was difficult to give\na purer or better explained summary of pantheism\u201d than that\nprovided by this \u201cdark man\u201d, Giordano Bruno (Jacobi 1789,\nIX, XI).\n\nIn the ensuing intellectual uproar, the Pantheismusstreit\n(\u201cPantheism controversy\u201d) that dominated late eighteenth-\nand early nineteenth-century German philosophy, Bruno emerged as the\ngreat precursor of Spinoza and a major philosopher in his own right.\nSpinoza and Spinozists had followed in Bruno\u2019s footsteps,\nconcluded F. W. J. Schelling, who thereupon wrote a dialogue,\nBruno or On the Divine and Natural Principle of Things\n(1802), setting out a Platonized form of Spinozism. Goethe, writing to\nSchiller, while expressing reservations, confided that what he\nunderstood or thought he understood of the dialogue was in tune with\nhis \u201cinnermost convictions\u201d (McFarland 1969, 247). Many\nothers concurred, among them Hegel, who, in his Lectures on the History of Philosophy (1827\u201328), praised Bruno\u2019s\nwritings, fantastic and confused though they might be, for displaying\n\u201ca sense of indwelling spirit\u201d. Coleridge was a steadfast\nadmirer, even in later life, when his philosophical and religious\nviews were less consonant with Bruno\u2019s. \u201cThis man\u201d,\nhe wrote in 1819, \u201cthough a pantheist, was religious\u201d\n(Gatti 2011, 203). This new found enthusiasm led to the publication of\neditions of Bruno\u2019s Italian and Latin works in Germany by Adolph\nWagner (1830) and August Friedrich Gfr\u00f6rer (1836) respectively,\nthe first editions of his works in their original languages since the\nmid-seventeenth century.\n\nThis European revival was the setting for Bruno\u2019s rehabilitation\nin Italy. Hegel, Michelet and others had portrayed the period that we\nnow know, thanks to Michelet, as the Renaissance and Reformation as\nthe birthplace of modernity. This was manifest above all, though not\nexclusively, through the artistic, literary and philosophical\nachievements of the period, which had broken the Roman Catholic\nChurch\u2019s dominance in spiritual and cultural concerns. For many,\nthe most conspicuous being Jacob Burckhardt in The Civilization of\nthe Renaissance in Italy (1860), the honor for this rupture\nbelonged principally to the Italians, \u201cthe first born among the\nsons of modern Europe\u201d (pt 2, ch. 1). Sentiments of these kinds were welcome\nin Italy. Pride in its cultural achievements fed into the crescendo of\nnationalist fervour\u2014the \u201cRisorgimento\u201d, leading\neventually to the proclamation of Italy as an independent kingdom in\n1861\u2014and mounting hostility in some circles towards the Roman\nCatholic Church. The Church had been blamed for the peninsula\u2019s\npolitical fragmentation and intellectual atrophy ever since the\nCounter-Reformation.\n\nCircumstances could scarcely have been more propitious for heterodox\nRenaissance thinkers such as Telesio, Campanella, Galileo Galilei and,\nabove all, Bruno. For many Italians, his philosophy, heroic defiance\nof ecclesiastical authority and execution exemplified the long\nstruggle to free philosophy from the trammels of revealed\nreligion. Popular versions of Bruno\u2019s life and death likened him\nto Socrates, Christ or, nearer home, martyrs of the Risorgimento. This\nadulation found its most visible expression in the monumental bronze\nstatue, designed by the sculptor Ettore Ferrari, a mason and later\nGrand Master of the masonic lodge, the Grande Oriente d\u2019Italia,\nlocated in Rome. In 1889, in the face of tooth-and-nail opposition\nfrom the Vatican, the statue was erected, glaring directly towards the\nHoly See, on the very spot in the Campo dei Fiori where Bruno was\nbelieved to have been burned at the stake. For nineteenth-century\nItalian intellectuals such as Vincenzo Gioberti, Bertrando Spaventa\nand Francesco Fiorentino, he was, as he had been for Enlightenment\nthinkers, a \u201cSpinozist\u201d in many respects or more broadly,\na secular humanist, someone who had liberated the human spirit from\nthe suffocating confines of religious orthodoxy and paved the way for\nmodern philosophy and natural science. Catholic apologists rose to the\nChurch\u2019s defence, belittling this \u201cBrunomania\u201d, as\nthey dubbed it, and on occasion denying that Bruno had been executed.\nAmid the turmoil, Bertrando Spaventa, Felice Tocco, Francesco\nFiorentino and other Italian scholars produced critical editions of\nBruno\u2019s Latin and Italian works or wrote studies on them,\nthereby laying the foundations of modern Bruno scholarship and\nappreciation of him as a philosopher. During the twentieth century\nBruno enjoyed a reputation among orthodox historians of the Soviet\nUnion as the first modern genius of a materialist philosophy; those\nwho, like Lev Karsavin, presented a philosophically and historically\ncontextualized interpretation of his thought, were persecuted for\ntheir \u201cbourgeiois\u201d views. Comparatively recent attempts to\nestablish magic or mnemotechnics as the key to his philosophy such as\nthose of Frances Yates, valuable though they remain for incidental\ndetails and insights, obscure Bruno\u2019s stated intention to\narticulate a \u201cnew philosophy\u201d, tout court.\n",
