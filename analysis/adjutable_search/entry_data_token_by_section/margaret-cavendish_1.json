    "main_text": "Intelligent Matter in the History of Philosophy\n2. Intelligent Matter in the History of Philosophy\n\nCavendish is working within a philosophical tradition in which the\ndoctrine that matter is self-moving and intelligent is almost\ncompletely unintelligible. To those of her opponents who allow that\nthe doctrine can be entertained, it is unlikely at best, and\nif true it is a terrible disappointment.\n\nFor example, in Plato we find the view that \u201cthe philosopher\nfrees the soul from association with the body as much as\npossible\u201d (Plato, 64e\u201365a). For Plato, souls are invisible and\nintangible and hence indivisible and divine, and bodies are their\ncomplete opposite (78b\u201380b). We know from an analysis of our concept\nof body, and from our presumably related observation of the sudden\ninactivity of things that die, that animated bodies have a soul and\nthat bodies on their own are inert (105c\u2013e). A soul is obviously what\nactivates and enlivens a body, and the opposite of a soul, its body,\nis \u201cdeath\u201d (105e). Our embodiment and our resulting\nphysical needs incline us to pursue sensible objects, but these are\nnot worthy of our attention, and they interfere with our ability to\nattend to things that are.\n\nWe find a similar contempt for the body in prominent philosophers of\nlater ancient philosophy and in medieval and early modern philosophers\nas well. In \u201cOn Beauty,\u201d Plotinus speaks to \u201cthe\ndarkness inherent in matter\u201d (Plotinus, I.6, 37). He praises the\nsensible, but only to the extent that it imitates immaterial ideas and\nminds:\n\nThis is why fire glows with a beauty beyond all other bodies, for fire\nholds the rank of idea in their regard. Always struggling aloft, this\nsubtlest of elements is at the last limits of the bodily. \u2026It\nsparkles and glows like an idea. (Ibid.)\n\n\nFire is still material, of course, and material things are no\nsubstitute for things that are immaterial and (hence) divine (40).\nPlotinus continues,\n\n[A]n ugly soul\u2026 is friend to filthy pleasures, it lives a life\nabandoned to bodily sensation and enjoys its depravity. \u2026If\nsomeone is immersed in mire or daubed with mud, his native comeliness\ndisappears; all one sees is the mire and mud with which he is covered.\nUgliness is due to the alien matter that encrusts him. If he would be\nattractive once more, he has to wash himself, get clean again, make\nhimself what he was before. Thus we would be right in saying that\nugliness of soul comes from its mingling with, fusion with, collapse\ninto the bodily and material\u2026. (39)\n\n\nIn a word, Plotinus thinks that we should do all that we can to\nmitigate the unfortunate fact of our embodiment and instead engage in\nphilosophical reflection. A hundred years later Augustine repeats the\nsame view exactly:\n\nHow highly do you value th[e] will? You surely do not think it should\nbe compared with wealth or honours or physical pleasures, or even all\nof these together. \u2026Then should we not rejoice a little that we\nhave something in our souls\u2014this very thing that I call a good\nwill\u2014in comparison with which those things we mentioned are\nutterly worthless\u2026? (Augustine, 19)\n\n\nFor Augustine, body is so bad that sin consists in turning our\nattention away from eternal things to things that are temporal and\ncorporeal (27). Augustine is working in the Christian tradition, and\nit cannot be ignored that although Christ made a tremendous sacrifice\nin giving up his body, the abandonment of the physical in favor of the\npurely spiritual reads very differently through an Augustinian and\nPlatonic lens.\n\nThis same manner of thinking finds its way into the seventeenth\ncentury as well. In the Cartesian (and very Augustinian and Platonic)\nphilosopher Nicolas Malebranche, we find the view that bodies are\n\u201cinferior things\u201d that are essentially passive and inert\n(Malebranche 1674\u20135, VI.ii.3, 447, 448). He brings together the\nwhole spectrum of themes that are advanced by his body-dismissing\npredecessors. In Dialogues on Metaphysics and on Religion,\nhis spokesperson Theodore says to his opponent Aristes that our\nembodiment is a burden and that we should neutralize it to whatever\nextent we can:\n\nYou are now ready to make thousands and thousands of discoveries in\nthe land of truth. Distinguish ideas from sensations, but distinguish\nthem well\u2026. Your modalities are only darkness, remember that.\nSilence your senses, your imagination and your passions, and you will\nhear the pure voice of inner truth, the clear and evident responses of\nour common master. Never confound evidence, which results from the\ncomparison of ideas, with the vivacity of the sensations which affect\nand disturb you. The more vivid our sensations, the more they spread\ndarkness. \u2026In a word, avoid all that affect you and quickly\nembrace all that enlightens you. We must follow Reason despite the\nseductions, the threats, the insults of the body to which we are\nunited, despite the action of the objects surrounding us. (Malebranche\n1688, III.viii, 36)\n\n\nFor Malebranche, the search for truth is very literally a matter of\nretreating to the study, where the possibility is minimized that we\nwill be distracted by the lures of the sensible world. In\nMalebranche\u2019s (and Cavendish\u2019s) contemporary Ralph Cudworth we find a\nsimilar disgust for the body. Cudworth argues that there is a\nhierarchy of being that applies to creatures and that minds are at the\ntop. Bodies are dead and lowly, and are squarely at the bottom:\n\nThere is unquestionably, a Scale or Ladder of\nNature, and Degrees of Perfection and\nEntity, one above another, as of Life,\nSense, and Cogitation, above Dead, Sensless and\nUnthinking Matter; or Reason and\nUnderstanding above Sense,\n &c.[8]\n\n\nCudworth is certainly aware that the bodies that surround us are\nactive and engage in behaviors that are orderly and (at least\napparently) teleological, but none of this is evidence that matter is\nnot dead. Cudworth concludes that because matter is dead, its\norderly and purposive behavior can only be explained on the assumption\nthat it is accompanied by a (necessarily immaterial) guide (Cunning\n2003).\n\nThere are other philosophers in the seventeenth century who agree that\nmatter is a detestable sort of being, but conclude that it does not\nexist, or at least that it does not exist as conceived by the\ntradition. In Anne Conway we find the view that God would not, and did\nnot, create it:\n\nhow can any dead thing proceed from him or be created by him, such as\nmere body or matter\u2026? It has truly been said that God does not\nmake death. It is equally true that he did not make any dead thing,\nfor how can a dead thing come from him who is infinite life and love?\nOr, how can any creature receive so vile and diminished an essence\nfrom him (who is so infinitely generous and good)\u2026? (Conway\n1690, 45)\n\n\nFor Conway, God creates only beings that are alive, and so the\neveryday objects that surround us are something other than what\nPlotinus, Malebranche and Cudworth had thought. There exists\nnothing that is brutish, inert, and unthinking, and instead there is a\ncontinuum of creatures that exist on a spectrum from highly\nintelligent and active to largely dim and dull. Cavendish agrees with\nConway that nothing answers to the traditional conception of matter,\nbut unlike Conway she is happy to say that matter surrounds us.\nCavendish and Conway are for the most part in agreement;\nCavendish simply rejects the traditional conception of matter as\ninadequate, and then proceeds to argue that the things that our\nconcept of matter has always picked out\u2014the things that our\nlanguage has designated as \u2018material\u2019\u2014are something\nmore (Borcherding 2022). Unlike many of her opponents, Cavendish is\nnot disappointed by the result that minds are material. She thinks on\nthe contrary that it is a source of hope. For example, if we\nappreciate that minds are corporeal, we will be able to come up with\nbetter and more systematic and less groping treatments of mental\n illness.[9]\n As evidence for her view, she points to the obvious facts that a\nperson\u2019s mood and energy are affected by nutrition (Cavendish 1663,\n431\u20132), and that old age and injury to the brain can neutralize\nsome of our cognitive functions (Cavendish 1668b, 85\u20136, 113;\nCavendish 1663, 334\u20135). Cavendish is breaking with her tradition\nand arguing that the fulfillment of a person is not a matter of\nturning away from the body but understanding all of its dynamics and\nembracing\n it.[10]\n",
