In Berkeley, naturally, he ran into\nthe Free Speech Movement, and he encountered the \u201cstudent\nrevolution\u201d there too, as well as in London and Berlin. This\nobviously fired his interest in political philosophy, more especially\nin political questions about science. Of his post at Berkeley, he\nlater said: \n\nMy function was to carry out the educational policies of the State of\nCalifornia which means I had to teach people what a small group of\nwhite intellectuals had decided was knowledge. (SFS, p. 118).\n\n\nHowever, Feyerabend\u2019s experience under these educational\npolicies was undoubtedly one of the defining periods of his\nintellectual life, a time in which he became deeply suspicious of\nthese intellectuals and \u201cWestern rationalism\u201d as a whole:\n\n\nIn the years 1964ff. Mexicans, Blacks, Indians entered the university\nas a result of new educational policies. There they sat, partly\ncurious, partly disdainful, partly simply confused hoping to get an\n\u201ceducation\u201d. What an opportunity for a prophet in search\nof a following! What an opportunity, my rationalist friends told me,\nto contribute to the spreading of reason and the improvement of\nmankind! I felt very differently. For it dawned on me that the\nintricate arguments and the wonderful stories I had so far told to my\nmore or less sophisticated audience might just be dreams, reflections\nof the conceit of a small group who had succeeded in enslaving\neveryone else with their ideas. Who was I to tell these people what\nand how to think? (ibid. See also KT, p. 123).\n\n\nAt this time, Feyerabend gave two lectures, one on general philosophy,\nand one on philosophy of science. He seems to have got into some\ntrouble at Berkeley by running his seminar on unacceptably loose\nlines, regularly cancelling lectures, and failing to prepare for the\nlectures he did give: \n\nI often told the students to go home\u2014the official notes would\ncontain everything they needed. As a result an audience of 300, 500,\neven 1,200 shrank to 50 or 30. I wasn\u2019t happy about that; I\nwould have preferred a larger audience, and yet I repeated my advice\nuntil the administration intervened. Why did I do it? Was it because I\ndisliked the examination system, which blurred the line between\nthought and routine? Was it because I despised the idea that knowledge\nwas a skill that had to be acquired and stabilized by rigorous\ntraining? Or was it because I didn\u2019t think much of my own\nperformance? All these factors may have played a role. (p. 122).\n\n\nBut although he sympathised with the original aims of the student\nmovement, Feyerabend was unimpressed by their leaders, feeling that\ntheir ideas were as authoritarian as those they were trying to\nreplace. He reports having cut fewer lectures during the student\nstrike than either before or afterwards! Nevertheless, by holding his\nlectures off-campus during this campus war, Feyerabend antagonised the\nadministration that had hired him. Tales of him giving \u201cA\u201d\ngrades to every student in his class, regardless of their production\n(or lack of it), abound. He had the impression that some of his\ncolleagues, especially John Searle, wanted to have him fired, and that\nthey only gave up when they realised how much paperwork would be\ninvolved (p. 126). \n",
