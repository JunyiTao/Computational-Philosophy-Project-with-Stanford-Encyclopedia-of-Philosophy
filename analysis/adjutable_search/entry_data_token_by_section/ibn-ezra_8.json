    "main_text": "Rationale for the Commandments: Yesod Mora\n10. Rationale for the Commandments: Yesod Mora\n\n\nThe most systematic formulation of Ibn Ezra\u2019s philosophical ideas is\nfound in Yesod Mora (The Foundation of Reverence)\n(Cohen 2002). Significantly, this is a monograph on the rationale of\nthe commandments, perhaps the key field (along with biblical\ninterpretation, with which it overlaps somewhat) for the development\nof a specifically Judaic philosophy. Like his other writings, it is\nvery short, contains not a few cryptic passages whose meaning has\nnever been satisfactorily fleshed out, and does not always sit well\nwith his pronouncements in other writings. There is good reason to\nbelieve that Yesod Mora was written shortly before Ibn Ezra\u2019s\ndeath, and it thus may comprise his final statement on the issues.\n\n\nThe beginning of Yesod Mora contains a valuable survey of the\nsciences. This is not a formal classification of the type written by\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee and many others, whose aim is to put in\ntheir proper place all of the sciences. Instead, Ibn Ezra critically\nreviews the various branches of learning which are favored by groups\nof Jewish scholars. There are those whose \u201centire wisdom\u201d\nconsists in masora, the traditional inventory of letters and phonetic\nmarkings in Scripture. Some are interested only in Hebrew grammar;\nothers study only the Bible, yet others are interested only in the\nTalmud. None of these groups can achieve the wisdom they seek,\nhowever, without studying astronomy (hokhmat ha-mazalot).\nAstronomy in turn requires a foundation in geometry (hokhmat\nha-middot).  Also mandatory are psychology (hokhmat\nha-nefesh), which in turn has a perquisite physics, or perhaps\nmore accurately, physiology (toledet ha-shamayim, literally\n\u201cthat which is produced [or induced] by the heavens\u201d;\ntoledet refers generally to transformations of matter, but,\nin Ibn Ezra\u2019s usage, it is almost always applied to biological\nprocesses). Finally, logic (hokhmatha-mivta), \u201cthe\nbalance of all wisdom\u201d is also indispensable.\n\n\nTowards the end of this disquisition, theosophy of some sort (sod\nha-merkaba, shi\u2018ur qoma) is mentioned; Ibn Ezra\nseems to approve of it, if approached properly. At the very end of the\npassage, Ibn Ezra tries to tie everything together into a coherent\nstudy plan: \u201cHow can someone attempt to know something more\nsublime than he, if he knows neither his soul nor his body? Only he\nwho knows physics (or physiology?) and all of its proofs and logic can\nknow the universals that are preserved like a seal. Astronomy can be\nknown by means of clear proofs drawn from arithmetic (hokhmat\nha-heshbon), geometry (hokhmat ha-middot), and\nproportions (hokhmat ha-\u2018arakhim).  Only then will he\nbe able to ascend high above, and to know the secret of the soul, the\nsupernal angels, and the world to come.\u201d The plan calls for\nstudy of the body and soul, and astronomy as well, with the aim of\nsecuring universals. One can then move beyond the stars to \u201cthe\nsecret of the soul\u201d and the world or worlds beyond our own. The\norder in which the sciences are to be studied is clear enough, the\nconnection between them far less so.\n\n\nIbn Ezra never makes a clean break between traditional or religious\nsciences; quite the contrary, he urges all along that the sciences\nthat we would call secular are mandatory for understanding scriptural,\nlegal, and other issues of concern to Jews, not the least of which, of\ncourse, is self-fulfillment. In the course of a long list of examples\nthat illustrating this need, astrology (mishpatei ha-mazalot)\nis mentioned only once. Clearly, in this key text at least, Ibn Ezra\ndoes not accord to astrology the major standing it holds in his\nlegacy.  Moreover, none of the disciplines named seems to stand for\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d, though psychology, some sort of natural\nphilosophy, and theosophy are all mentioned separately. (See: What is\n\u201cPhilosophy\u201d for Ibn Ezra?) In any case, the separate\nlisting of psychology lends credence to our claim that Ibn Ezra\u2019s\nclear interest in the science of the soul is independent of, and by no\nmeans indicative of, any strong interest in philosophy in general.\n\n\nThe second chapter begins with an encomium to logic: \u201cHow noble\nis the science of logic, and it commences with knowledge of the five\nwords (millot).\u201d Ibn Ezra seems to be referring to the\nquinque voces; he names here \u201chigh universal\u201d,\n\u201clower universal\u201d or \u201chigh species\u201d, and\n\u201clow species\u201d. Understanding species and other such groups\nare of great use in classifying commandments, as well as in resolving\nsome apparent contradictions between biblical texts. However, the\nlogic applied is extremely basic, and once again, we have no evidence\nthat Ibn Ezra knew more than the basic terminology.\n\n\nThe discussion then moves on to commandments that are contingent,\ninsofar as they depend upon, or are limited to, a certain group (e.g.\npriests), an institution (e.g. temple sacrifices), gender specific\n(e.g. circumcision). This sifting allows Ibn Ezra, in chapter five, to\nget at those commandments that are absolute, \u201cprinciples that do\nnot depend upon a given time, a given place, or anything else.\u201d\nThese commandments, \u201cplanted in the heart\u201d, were known by\nmeans of reason even before the giving of the Torah. Ibn Ezra himself\nthus inserts, at the heart of this very Jewish, and legalistic,\ntreatise, the rational, humanistic outlook that marks his philosophy:\nthe core demands of Judaism depend not upon revelation but upon innate\nhuman reason, and they are no different from the rules that must\ngovern every human. \n",
