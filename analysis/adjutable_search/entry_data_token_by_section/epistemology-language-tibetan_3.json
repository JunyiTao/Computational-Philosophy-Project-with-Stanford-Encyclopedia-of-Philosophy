There is\nagreement as to which cognitions are reliable\ncognitions\u2014precisely those prescribed by Dharmak\u012brti,\nnamely, perception and inference\u2014although not as to what defines\nthem as reliable cognitions. As for non-reliable cognitions, one finds\nan opposition between a fivefold typology, which is the trademark of\nworks of the pre-classical period, and a more basic threefold typology\nprescribed by Sakya Pandita.\n2.2.1 Reliable cognition (tshad ma)\n\nFollowing Dharmak\u012brti, Tibetan epistemologists restrict the\nnumber of reliable cognitions to two sorts: perception and inference.\nThe first is defined as \u201cnon-erroneous and devoid of\nconceptualization,\u201d the second as the \u201cunderstanding\ncoming from a triply characterized logical reason.\u201d Both share\nthe status of being \u201creliable cognitions\u201d (tshad\nma), a status that Dharmak\u012brti associatedin his\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika with the characteristics of\nbeing (1) \u201cnon-belying\u201d and (2) \u201crevealing an\nunknown object.\u201d In addition to a prolongation of the\ncommentarial dispute on the verses in which these characteristics are\ngiven, a notable confrontation is found in the Tibetan tradition\nbetween two models that can be distinguished in view of the\nunderstanding of perception that they entail: (a) a model in which\nperception retains a passive status insofar as, being devoid of\nconceptualization, it cannot itself achieve a determination of its\nobject, and (b) a model that seeks to give a more active role to\nperception without however stepping back on its characterization as\n\u201cnon-conceptual.\u201d Two versions of the \u201cactive\nperception\u201d model are found: an \u201cindirectly active\nperception\u201d model and an innovative \u201cdirectly active\nperception\u201d model.\na. The \u201cpassive perception\u201d model\n\nThe \u201cpassive perception\u201d model can also be termed the\n\u201cclassic\u201d model in that it claims to offer a more literal\nreading of Dharmak\u012brti. This model, adopted for instance by Sakya\nPandita, takes \u201cnon-belying,\u201d combined with\n\u201cnovelty,\u201d as definiens of reliable cognition. Without\ngiving a pragmatic view of reliability, this model involves the\ncapacity to fulfill a goal, or to have some causal efficacy, as a\ncriterion for the non-belying character of cognition. Although being\nnon-belying and novel is sufficient to qualify as reliable, in a\ntransactional context, conventional reliable cognitions are expected\nto lead to an ascertainment (nges pa). While inference\nascertains its object by itself, perception is unable to do so,\nbecause ascertainment\u2014a conceptual operation, equivalent to the\nelimination of opposite superimpositions\u2014is incompatible with\nits being \u201cdevoid of conceptualization.\u201d Such an\nascertainment, should it occur (this requires a number of\ncircumstantial elements), must be performed by a conceptual cognition\nthat follows perception. In other words, perception is reliable in\nitself, but has to rely on a subsequent conceptual mental episode for\nascertainment. This \u201ctwo-tier\u201d way of accounting for both\nreliability and determination keeps a strict division as to the role\nand capacity of non-conceptual and conceptual cognitions, which Sakya\nPandita compares respectively by way of illustration to \u201ca\nseeing mute\u201d and \u201ca speaking blind.\u201d Should a\nsubsequent ascertainment not arise immediately (due to the nature of\nthe object, competence and mindfulness of the cognizer, visibility,\netc.), the preceding episode of perception still qualifies a a\nreliable cognition, but its reliability has to be ascertained\nextrinsically.\nb. The \u201cactive perception\u201d model\n\nSome interpreters, already in India, were dissatisfied with this\n\u201cpassive\u201d status of perception. Tibetan epistemologists in\nthe pre-classical period similarly argued in favor of a more active\nrole for perception for it to qualify as a reliable cognition.\nb1. The \u201cindirectly active perception\u201d model\n\nOne version of the \u201cactive perception\u201d model was upheld by\nNgok Loden Sh\u00e9rap, who included in his understanding of\nreliable cognition the requirement of a conceptual determination,\nwhile upholding the classical tenet that perception itself cannot\nconceptually determine its object. The model of reliable perception he\nproposes is thus indirectly active. It follows the two-tier way of\naccounting for determination in the \u201cpassive perception\u201d\nmodel, but sets determination as a necessary condition for\nreliability.\n\nAn important consequence of this move is that it implies a distinction\nbetween perceptual cognitions that are reliable in this sense and\nperceptual cognitions that are not. Perceptual episodes that are such\nthat no subsequent determining cognition immediately arises, which, in\nthe passive model, were considered reliable cognitions whose\nreliability nevertheless had to be ascertained extrinsically, fail\nhere to qualify as reliable cognition. A further consequence is that\nthis model leaves room for mental episodes that are both reliable and\nnon-reliable. For instance, the perception of an impermanent patch of\nblue, which is followed by the determination \u201cblue\u201d but\nnot by the determination \u201cimpermanent,\u201d is only partially\nreliable.\nb2. The \u201cdirectly active perception\u201d model\n\nThe \u201cdirectly active perception\u201d model, which was\npropounded by Chapa, brings revolutionary changes, first by\nintroducing in the definition of reliable cognition the notion of\n\u201celimination of opposite superimpositions,\u201d then by\nclaiming that perception itself (not a subsequent conceptual\ncognition) performs such a function.\n\nChapa formulates a new definition of reliable cognition in terms of\nthe \u201cunderstanding of a veridical object\u201d (don bden\nrtogs). The object considered here is the \u201cengaged\nobject,\u201d and its being veridical is explained as a\ncorrespondence to the status of reality supported by the absence of\nopposition. The long version of this definition brings to the fore\nelements that are systematized by later authors in a threefold\nlist:\n\nthe elimination of opposite superimpositions\nnovelty\nthe mode of apprehension\u2014to be reliable, a cognition must\ndepend on its object in a way that it does not occur when the object\nis absent.\n\n\nIn the later Gelukpa tradition, which draws on this model, the\ndefinition whose short version is formulated in terms of \u201cnewly\nnon-belying\u201d also includes the requirement of \u201celiminating\nsuperimpositions.\u201d\n\nIn the Dharmak\u012brtian system, the \u201celimination of\nsuperimpositions\u201d is tantamount to ascertainment (nges\npa). This is to be understood in the framework of the\n\u201capoha\u201d (lit. \u201cexclusion\u201d) theory:\nany positive determination proceeds via the elimination of what is\nother. For instance, determining a patch of colour as\n\u201cblue\u201d does not consist in identifying some blue property\nor some blueness shared by blue things, but in differentiating this\npatch from the \u201cother,\u201d namely from things that are\nnot-blue. Determination as \u201cblue\u201d amounts to eliminating\nactual superimpositions of \u201cnon-blue\u201d (for instance, if\none thought that the patch was yellow), or potential ones; in the\nformer case, the determination eliminates a mistaken judgment and\nreplaces it by a correct one, in the latter it prevents the subsequent\narising of a mistaken judgment. Both sides of the process,\nsuperimposition and its elimination, are, for Dharmak\u012brti,\nexclusively conceptual operations.\n\nThe adoption of the criteria of \u201celiminating\nsuperimpositions\u201d in the definition of reliable cognition does\nnot affect inference. According to Chapa, however, \u201celimination\nof superimpositions\u201d is not limited to conceptual cognition in\ngeneral. It has a broader scope than the kind of conceptual operation\nthat follows an intentional determination (zhen pa).\nPerception, although it does not perform any intentional\ndetermination, is indeed capable of eliminating superimpositions. It\ndoes so via a causal process: perception gives rise, at the next\nmoment, to another non-conceptual mental episode in which the\npotential of the wrong superimposition to arise has been neutralized,\nthus preventing its subsequent arising. By the third moment, there are\nno more superimpositions. Insofar as it, by this means, eliminates\nopposite superimpositions, perception is reliable and can be held to\nascertain (nges pa) its object, without involving any\nconceptual element. Whether a conceptual determination occurs\nsubsequently or not is irrelevant to the reliability of the preceding\nperceptual awareness.\n\nThe set of circumstances invoked in the passive model and the\nindirectly active model to explain the lack of a conceptual\ndetermination subsequent to a perceptual episode is now invoked to\nexplain why, although all aspects of the object appear, not all\nsuperimpositions opposite to these aspects are eliminated. In\nparticular, Chapa identifies as an objective condition preventing the\nelimination of superimpositions the case when a feature is\nnon-manifest (for instance, \u201cnon-blue\u201d can be eliminated,\nbut \u201cpermanent\u201d cannot be eliminated when perceiving an\nimpermanent patch of blue, because the feature blue is manifest, but\nimpermanence is not). \n\nA further specificity worth noting is that the \u201celimination of\nopposite superimpositions\u201d can bear on an object which is not\nthe appearing object. For instance, a perception which has a patch of\nblue as its appearing object can eliminate the superimposition\n\u201cnon-blue\u201d and thereby ascertain \u201cblue,\u201d but\nit can also eliminate the superimposition \u201cpresence of a patch\nof yellow\u201d and thereby ascertain \u201cabsence of a patch of\nyellow\u201d even though the absence of yellow does not appear to\nthis perception. The first process is termed \u201cdirect\nrealization\u201d (dngos rtogs), the second \u201cindirect\nrealization\u201d (shugs rtogs). A particular application of\nthe \u201cdirect/indirect realization\u201d model regards the\nrealization or ascertainment that can be achieved via reflexive\nawareness (rang rig). Reflexive awareness allows the\nascertainment of a range of features pertaining to the episode of\nawareness that is its apprehended object, and directly permits the\nindirect ascertainment of features pertaining to the object of that\nepisode of awareness.\n\nThe main criticism addressed by advocates of the \u201cpassive\u201d\nmodel to the \u201cdirectly active\u201d model is that it attributes\nto perception an operation that is restricted to conceptual\ncognitions; in their view indeed, \u201celimination of\nsuperimpositions\u201d amounts exclusively to the \u201cexclusion of\nwhat is other,\u201d the mode of operation of conceptual cognitions.\nProponents of the \u201cdirectly active\u201d model are not,\nhowever, guilty of attributing to perception a conceptual operation.\nIt is thus, rather, their new conception of \u201celimination of\nsuperimpositions\u201d that is at stake here, for which the more\ntraditionally oriented proponents of the \u201cpassive\u201d model\ndo not see a grounding in Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s system.\n\nAs hinted at in the last discussion, the fundamental disagreement\nbetween advocates of the respective models with regard to perception\nand more generally with regard to the definition of reliable cognition\nhas consequences for their understanding of non-reliable\ncognitions.\n2.2.2. Non-reliable cognitions\na. Fivefold typology\n\nBy embedding the discussion of reliable cognition within a general\nexamination of mental episodes, Tibetan epistemologists were led to\ndevelop a typology of non-reliable cognitions. A fivefold typology is\nshared by the majority of scholars in the pre-classical period and is\nmostly adopted in later Gelukpa textbooks. Thinkers who adopt it\nfrequently disagree, however, about the phrasing of the definition of\neach type and the specific cases they cover or not.\n\nNon-ascertaining perception (snang la ma nges pa). These\nare typically cases of non-conceptual cognitions that fail to\neliminate opposite superimpositions with regard to their appearing\nobject. This failure can result from a lack of attention, of wit, of\nfamiliarity, or can be due to the nature of an appearing aspect; the\nlatter might be non-manifest, or too \u201csubtle.\u201d Such\ncognitions do not qualify as reliable since an elimination of opposite\nsuperimpositions does not take place, but still qualify as perceptions\ninsofar as they are non-erroneous and devoid of conceptualization.\nAlternatively, they are defined in terms of their inability to bring\nabout a subsequent determining conceptual cognition.\nPost-knowledge cognition (bcad pa\u02bci yul can, or\nbcad shes). Such cognition, either conceptual or\nnon-conceptual, applies to an object with regard to which opposite\nsuperimpositions have already been eliminated. It thereby fails to\nfulfill the criterion of \u201cnovelty.\u201d\nFactive assessment (yid dpyod). Such a cognition\ncorrectly ascertains an object conceptually, but not via a proper\ninferential process. Although it is novel and eliminates opposite\nsuperimpositions, it does not qualify as reliable in view of its mode\nof apprehension. Indeed, factive assessment is held to entail truth,\nwhile still not depending on its object either via a relation of\ncausality or identity.\nMistaken cognition (log shes). A cognition can be\nmistaken from the point of view of its apprehended object or of its\nintentional object. In both cases, the error consists in not\napprehending\u2014respectively, not conceiving\u2014in concordance\nwith reality. Any cognition in which something that is not real, i.e.,\nnot causally efficient, appears is \u201cerroneous.\u201d This\nincludes perceptual errors such as hallucinations and dreams, as well\nas all conceptual cognitions since their apprehended object is a\nconcept, i.e., something that is merely superimposed. Determination\n(zhen pa) is in itself erroneous in that it confuses what is\nconceived and what is real. More restrictively, \u201cerroneous with\nregard to the intentional object\u201d indicates that a determination\nis faulty in that it does not relate to a state of affairs, for\ninstance, if one determines sound as permanent whereas it is in\nreality impermanent.\nDoubt (the tshom). Doubt occurs when one fails to choose\nbetween two alternative possibilities, leaving both options open.\nDoubt is usually considered a conceptual cognition. It may be held to\ninvolve an intentional operation of determination (zhen pa),\nbut does not bring about a conclusive ascertainment (nges\npa), either mistaken or non-mistaken. This case thus appears as\nthe conceptual pendent of non-ascertaining perception.\n\nb. Threefold typology and critique of the fivefold typology\n\nOpponents to the new definition of reliable cognition and the\n\u201cactive perception\u201d model, starting with Sakya Pandita,\ninstead adopted a threefold typology of non-reliable cognitions:\n\nNon-understanding (ma rtogs)\nMistaken understanding (log shes/log rtog)\nDoubt (the tshom).\n\n\nThese share as definiens the failure of being\n\u201cnon-belying\u201d and can be ultimately reduced to the unique\ncategory of non-understanding.\n\nThe critique of the fivefold typology of non-reliable cognition\ntargets in particular the categories of non-ascertaining perception,\npost-knowledge cognition, and factive assessment. \n\nSakya Pandita argues from the perspective of the \u201cpassive\nperception\u201d model, relying on the understanding of perception as\na passive cognition which does not itself ascertain its object, but\nwhose reliability is actually independent of this subsequent\nascertainment. The category of \u201cnon-ascertaining\ncognition\u201d is thus denied the status of independent category:\naccording to proponents of the \u201cpassive perception\u201d model,\nevery perception is a non-ascertaining perception; ascertainment (when\nit takes place) is always the deed of a subsequent conceptual\ncognition. There is thus no such thing as an \u201cascertaining\nperception\u201d if what is implied is ascertainment by perception\nitself.\n\nPost-knowledge cognition is also rejected as a distinct category.\nNon-conceptual post-knowledge cognition is in particular held to be\nimpossible. Indeed, any subsequent perception necessarily has a new\nobject since the object of the previous perception, being a momentary\nparticular, has already ceased to exist when the subsequent perception\narises. More generally, a post-knowledge cognition would have no\ncognitive role, for its object would not be something that is to be\nunderstood; it is accordingly judged to amount to\nnon-understanding.\n\nCases of factive assessment are subsumed under the category of doubt.\nDoubt should not be understood here in the sense of\n\u201chesitation,\u201d between two options but as the lack of\ndecisive ascertainment. Indeed, that an episode of factive assessment\nis actually correct\u2014which can only be ascertained\nextrinsically\u2014does not amount to its constituting a decisive\nascertainment. If no evidence at all is adduced, such \u201clucky\nguesses\u201d are not worth any certitude, and if faulty evidence is\nadduced, they are to be interpreted as pseudo-inferences.\n",
