    "main_text": "\n\nLouis Pierre Althusser (1918\u20131990) was one of the most\ninfluential Marxist philosophers of the 20th Century. As\nthey seemed to offer a renewal of Marxist thought as well as to render\nMarxism philosophically respectable, the claims he advanced in the\n1960s about Marxist philosophy were discussed and debated worldwide.\nDue to apparent reversals in his theoretical positions, to the\nill-fated facts of his life, and to the historical fortunes of Marxism\nin the late twentieth century, this intense interest in\nAlthusser\u2019s reading of Marx did not survive the 1970s. Despite\nthe comparative indifference shown to his work as a whole after these\nevents, the theory of ideology Althusser developed within it has been\nbroadly deployed in the social sciences and humanities and has\nprovided a foundation for much \u201cpost-Marxist\u201d philosophy.\nIn addition, aspects of Althusser\u2019s project have served as\ninspiration for Analytic Marxism as well as for Critical\nRealism and Discourse Analysis. Though this influence is not\nalways explicit, Althusser\u2019s work and that of his students\ncontinues to inform the research programs of literary studies,\npolitical philosophy, history, economics, and sociology. At present,\nAlthusser\u2019s philosophy as a whole is undergoing a critical\nreevaluation by scholars who have benefited from the anthologization\nof previously unpublished texts. His concepts are also being\nincreasingly employed by philosophers, political theorists, and\nactivists who have returned to Marx and to Marxian analyses in order\nto explain and to envision alternatives to our present socio-economic\nconjuncture.\n",
