    "main_text": "Fundamentals || Generic and Specific Consciousness\n1.4 Generic and Specific Consciousness\n\nExplanations answer specific questions. Two questions regarding\nphenomenal consciousness frame this entry: Generic and Specific. The\nfirst focuses on a mental state\u2019s being conscious in\ngeneral as opposed to not being conscious. Call this property\ngeneric consciousness, a property shared by specific\nconscious states such as seeing a red rose, feeling a touch, or being\nangry. Thus:\n\n\nGeneric Consciousness: What conditions/states N of\nnervous systems are necessary and (or) sufficient for a mental state,\nM, to be conscious as opposed to not?\n\n\nIf there is such an N, then the presence of N entails\nthat an associated mental state M is conscious and (or) its\nabsence entails that M is unconscious.\n\nA second focus will be on the content of consciousness, say that\nassociated with a perceptual experience\u2019s being of some\nperceptible X. This yields a question about specific contents\nof consciousness such as experiencing the motion of an object (see\n section 5.3.1)\n or a vibration on one\u2019s finger (see\n section 5.3.2):\n\n\nSpecific Consciousness: What neural states or properties are\nnecessary and/or sufficient for a conscious perceptual state to have\ncontent X rather than Y?\n\n\nExpanding a bit, perceptual states have intentional content and\nspecifying that content is one way of describing what that state is\nlike. In introspectively accessing her conscious states, a subject\nreports what her experience is like by reporting what she experiences.\nThus, the subject can report seeing an object moving, changing color,\nor being of a certain kind (e.g., a mug) and thus specify the content\nof the perceptual state. Discussion of specific consciousness will\nfocus on perceptual states described as consciously perceiving\nX where X can be a particular such as a face, a property\nsuch as the frequency of a vibration or a proposition, say seeing that\nan object moves in a certain direction.\n\nMany philosophers take perceiving X to be perceptually\nrepresenting X. Intentional content on this reading is a\nsemantic notion, and this suggests a linking principle tying conscious\ncontent to the brain: Perceptually representing X is based on\nneural representations of X. The \u201cbased on\u201d\nlocution hedges on the precise relation between neural contents and\nconscious contents, but a simple relation is identity: neural content\nis perceptual\n content.[3]\n This principle expresses a type of first-order\nrepresentationalism about phenomenal content, a topic we return\nto in\n section 5;\n see also the entry on\n representational theories of consciousness.\n The principle explains specific consciousness by appeal to neural\nrepresentational content.\n\nPosing a clear question involves grasping its possible answers and in\nscience, this is informed by identifying experiments that can provide\nevidence for such answers. The emphasis on necessary and sufficient\nconditions in our two questions indicates how to empirically test\nspecific proposals. To test sufficiency, one would aim to produce or\nmodulate a certain neural state and then demonstrate that\nconsciousness of a certain form arises. To test necessity, one would\neliminate a certain neural state and demonstrate that consciousness is\nabolished. Notice that such tests go beyond mere correlation between\nneural states and conscious states (see\n section 1.6\n on neural correlates and sections\n 2.2,\n 4 and\n 5\n for tests of necessity and sufficiency).\n\nIn many experimental contexts, the underlying idea is causal\nnecessity and sufficiency. However, if \\(A=B\\), then A\u2019s\npresence is also necessary and sufficient for B\u2019s\npresence since they are identical. Thus, a brain lesion that\neliminates N and thereby eliminates conscious state S\nmight do so either because N is causally necessary for S\nor because \\(N=S\\). An intermediate relation is that N\nconstitutes or grounds S which does not imply\nthat \\(N=S\\) (see the entry on\n metaphysical grounding).\n Whichever option holds for S, the first step is to find\nN, a neural correlate of consciousness\n (section 1.6).\n\nIn what follows, to explain generic consciousness, various global\nproperties of neural systems will be considered\n (section 3)\n as well as specific anatomical regions that are tied to conscious\nversus unconscious vision as a case study\n (section 4).\n For specific consciousness, fine-grained manipulations of neural\nrepresentations will be examined that plausibly shift and modulate the\ncontents of perceptual experience\n (section 5).\n",
