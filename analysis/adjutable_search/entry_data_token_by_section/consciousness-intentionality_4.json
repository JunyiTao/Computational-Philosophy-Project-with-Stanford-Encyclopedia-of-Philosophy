    "main_text": "Varieties of Intentionalism\n5. Varieties of Intentionalism\n\nOne evidently fundamental division in views about the relationship of\nconsciousness and intentionality separates those who think that\nconsciousness\u2014more specifically, the phenomenal character of the\nsort of experience we actually have\u2014necessarily carries with it\nsome kind of intentionality, and those who do not. We might call the\nformer (as will be seen, quite varied group)\n\u201cintentionalists\u201d and the latter (following Horgan and\nTienson 2002) \u201cseparatists\u201d. Intentionalism, so\ncharacterized, can cover a wide variety of positions, partly because\nof potential variety in just how intentionality is conceived. Exactly\nwhat contrast is marked by \u201cintentionalism vs. separatism\u201d\nwill depend heavily on one\u2019s conception of intentionality.\n\nStill, operating at first only with a broad and open notion of this\ncontrast, perspectives reasonably regarded as separatist occupied the\nmainstream of much twentieth century analytic philosophy. According to\nan important (once predominant) view, consciousness is exhausted by\nnon-intentional \u201cqualia\u201d or \u201craw feels\u201d.\nPlausibly, the acceptance of this view owes much to the profound\ninfluence of Gilbert Ryle\u2019s Concept of Mind (1949) in\nthe development of analytic philosophy. As part of his argument\nagainst a Cartesian notion of mind as the site of hidden\n(\u201coccult\u201d) \u201cghostly\u201d occurrences, Ryle\ncontends that the stream of consciousness has nothing to do with\nwhat\u2019s central to mind, since it contains only sensations and\nimagery that provide \u201cno possibility of deciding whether the\ncreature that had these was an animal or a human being; an idiot, a\nlunatic, or a sane man\u201d\u2014nothing of which it is appropriate\nto ask whether it is correct or incorrect, veridical or nonveridical.\nAlso powerfully influential, in the same era and intellectual milieu,\nwas Wittgenstein\u2019s (1953) attack on the idea of understanding as\nan \u201cinner process\u201d, and his criticism of the notion that\nthere could be a private language. Popularity of Wittgensteinian\ninsistence on the need for public criteria of meaning could\u2014and\nplausibly did\u2014reinforce a Rylean belittlement of consciousness,\non the assumption that consciousness, being something hidden\nor \u201cinner\u201d, could bring with it distinctions in\nunderstanding and intelligence only if meaning were something\npurely private\u2014as it cannot be. At any rate, partly\nthrough the reception of Ryle and Wittgenstein in U.T. Place\u2019s\n(1956) and J.J.C Smart\u2019s (1959) influential brain-based\nmaterialist view about consciousness, the reduction of consciousness\nto sensation and sensory imagery became firmly implanted in philosophy\nof mind, since these writings did so much to set the terms of its\ndebates.\n\nAlso influential, to similar effect, was the conception expressed in\nWilfrid Sellars\u2019 (1956) distinction between sentience\n(sensation) and sapience. Whereas the qualities of feelings\ninvolved in the former\u2014mere sensations\u2014require no\ncognitive sophistication and are readily attributable to brutes, the\nlatter\u2014involving awareness of, awareness\nthat\u2014requires that one have the right concepts, which\ncannot be guaranteed just by having sensations, but needs learning and\ninferential capacities (which Sellars believed come only with\nlanguage). Richard Rorty (1979) was not alone in taking Sellars\u2019\nviews to support a strict separation of the phenomenal and the\nintentional (see also Brandom 1994). Rorty\u2019s appropriation of\nSellars (blended with Quinean eliminativism) leads him to deny not\njust the importance, but even the reality of consciousness.\n\nExternalist arguments (of the sort mentioned in Section 4) have also\nbeen taken to support the separation of the \u201cqualitative\u201d\nfrom meaning and content (hence the separation of consciousness from\nintentionality). For it has been sometimes assumed that the phenomenal\ncharacter of one\u2019s experience is \u201cfixed\ninternally\u201d\u2014i.e., it has no necessary relation to the\nnature of particular substances in one\u2019s external environment or\nto one\u2019s linguistic community. Thus if externalist arguments\n(like those of Putnam and Burge) show that neither meaning nor content\nis \u201cin the head\u201d, phenomenal consciousness cannot imply\nany intentionality or content. Putnam (1981) himself drew such a\nconclusion, and much like Ryle, took the stream of consciousness to\ncomprise nothing more than sensations and images, which (recalling\nFrege) are to be set apart from thought and meaning. Without denying\nimportant differences in the views just mentioned, it seems reasonable\nto suppose that together they helped entrench in analytic philosophy a\nconception (sometimes welded to the term \u201cqualia\u201d) that\nconfines consciousness, in the experiential/what it\u2019s like\nsense, to sensations and sensory images\u2014and thus segregates it\nfrom thought, concepts, and \u201cpropositional\nattitudes\u201d\u2014hence from intentionality. (For a recent\ndefense of this tradition, see Papineau 2021.)\n\nObjections to this conception of sense-experience became increasingly\ncommon towards the end of the twentieth century, from diverse angles\nand motivations, in writings affirming a variety of intentionalist\npositions. But even before that, separatism was neither unambiguously\nembraced nor universal in analytic philosophy (consider Anscombe\n1965). And an important explicit statement of broadly intentionalist\nviews of perceptual experience can be found even in the early nineteen\neighties (Searle\u2019s 1983 Intentionality). One\nsignificant strain of intentionalism (quite unlike Searle\u2019s)\narising in the 1990s, combines acceptance of externalism about content\nwith a rejection of internalism about phenomenal character. Thus\nMartin Davies (1997), Fred Dretske (1995), and Michael Tye (1995,\n2002) argue that the phenomenal character of experience is also\nessentially determined by causal environmental connections.\nPace Putnam, externalism about intentionality should\nnot be taken to support separatism. Philosophers working from\nthis perspective also characteristically limit what kind of\nintentionality they took to be inseparable from phenomenal\ncharacter\u2014to some extent preserving the Rylean, purely sensory\nstream of consciousness\u2014but giving this a crucial intentionalist\ntwist. One draws a distinction between two sorts of intentionality or\nmental representation, one of which is found in sensory states, the\nother in cognitive or conceptual states. One then maintains that only\nthe former is entailed by or constitutive of phenomenal character. As\nalluded to earlier, Tye identifies phenomenal character with the\nnon-conceptual, picture- or map-like representational content he\nattributes to perceptual states which are poised to affect belief.\n\nTye\u2019s account also exemplifies two other features common to a\nnumber of externalist intentionalist views of consciousness that arose\nin the shadow of separatism. First, his view is, as we might put it,\nthoroughly \u201cnon-reflexivist\u201d (in the sense introduced in\nSection 3): it finds essential to one\u2019s conscious state neither\na representation of that state (i.e., no higher-order or\nself-representation), nor any directedness/reference to that state,\nnor any self-consciousness (whether this be construed as consciousness\nof the state itself, or of the self whose state it is). Secondly,\nTye\u2019s intentionalism is of what we might call a\nreductive sort. That is to say, the claim is not merely that\nit follows from an experience\u2019s having certain kinds of\nphenomenal character that it is intentional or has intentionality of\nsome sort. The claim is that its being phenomenal, and having the\ncharacter it does, comes as a necessary consequence of what kind of\nintentionality it has (or what kind of mental representation it is),\nwhere this type of intentionality/representation can be explained in\nterms that involve no primitive appeal to phenomenal character. Thus\nthe idea is not just the minimal intentionalist one that some kinds of\nphenomenality entail some kinds of intentionality. The idea is that\nphenomenal character can be explained as nothing but\u2014it can be\nexplanatorily reduced to\u2014a certain kind of intentionality or\nrepresentation.\n\nSuch reductive intentionalism is significantly motivated by a\nmetaphysical aim that has animated much analytic philosophy of mind:\nto say what mental states are in non-mentalistic, physical terms. Part\nof what inspires this goal is the thought that, if mind is real and\nefficacious, it must somehow be necessitated by the facts of nature\nthat science reveals\u2014a nature in itself fundamentally mindless.\nBut how could there be such necessitation of the mental by the\nnon-mental? Reductive intentionalism about consciousness offers the\noutline of an answer. Like the separatist, one starts from a general\nconception of intentionality (or mental representation) that does not\nassume consciousness, along with some idea about how such\nintentionality must arise in a world governed by the operation of\ncertain non-intentional, natural-causal processes. Then, still without\nappeal to consciousness, one purports to identify a certain\nspecies of intentionality (in terms of its use, its sources,\nits content), whose presence (and here one parts from separatism)\npurportedly guarantees the occurrence of experience with a certain\nphenomenal character. On such a reductive intentionalist perspective,\nseparatist philosophers do no more than contain the problematic\n\u201cinner\u201d, \u201cprivate\u201d, \u201csubjective\u201d\nmind of the Cartesian legacy and mitigate its harm, by sequestering it\nin a zone\u2014consciousness\u2014from which understanding,\nintelligence, meaning, intentionality have been safely evacuated (as\nin the view suggested by Kim 2011). The problem will be fully\nresolved, only if, instead of merely shrinking and isolating\nconsciousness, we find a way of entirely subsuming it in a conception\nof mental representation that owes nothing to it.\n\nWe have just focused on the emergence of a kind of intentionalism\nabout consciousness that is not only reductive, but\nexternalist, strongly restrictivist, and completely\nnon-reflexivist. But we now need to make it clearer how\nintentionalist views can be advanced that depart significantly from\nthat position along one or more of each of these dimensions. Consider\nfirst how an intentionalist might oppose both separatism and\nexternalism. One might begin with a Cartesian thought experiment in\nwhich one conceives of one\u2019s consciousness with all its\nsubjective riches intact, though the spatial realm of nature is\nsupposed a fiction. Or less radically, one may start with the science\nfiction scenario of a \u201cbrain in a vat\u201d, whose artificially\ninduced activity generates an extended history of sense experience\nthat is indistinguishable\u2014in its subjective, phenomenal\ncharacter\u2014from that of a subject with a human body moving about\nin the environment, as we believe ourselves to do. Again, if you\nassume an externalist view of intentionality, you may conclude that\nphenomenal character, being thus detachable from the external world,\nis also separable from (and insufficient for) intentionality. However,\nyou might instead turn your guns in the opposite\ndirection\u2014against externalism. It may seem to you that\nthe most intuitively plausible reading of the vat scenario would take\nthe brain\u2019s experience to be a global hallucination,\nsomething like a vivid, massively coherent dream, and so a\nsystematically incorrect experience of where the subject of\nexperience is and what is happening around it. And so, we should think\nthe intentionality or representational character of\nsuch experience would survive its estrangement from the world, along\nwith its phenomenal character. One may then infer that for at least\nsome contents/kinds of intentionality or representation, the kind of\ncausal tie between mind and world that, according to some\nexternalisms, we need for fixing its intentional content, is not\nstrictly necessary after all. This route to a non-externalist\nintentionalism about consciousness finds varying expression in, for\nexample, Kriegel 2011, Horgan and Tienson 2002, Loar 2003, and Ludwig\n1996b.)\n\nSuch a challenge to externalist intentionalism would clearly also\nchallenge its strategy of reductionism. There are other ways to be an\nintentionalist and reject both. One approach (albeit still using\nradical thought experiments) would draw on the sort of\n\u201czombie\u201d scenario whose metaphysical significance is\nexplored in such sophisticated detail by Chalmers 1996: one conceives\nof a world type identical to our own in terms of basic physics (laws,\ndistribution of particles and forces), but with consciousness left\nout. One might take the conceivability of such a world to give one\nreason to reject the externalist-intentionalist assumption that the\nright combination of natural, non-intentional, non-phenomenal facts\nmetaphysically guarantees the presence of consciousness. And one might\nstill combine this with the claim that certain forms of consciousness\ndo guarantee some sort of intentionality. This sort of non-reductive\nintentionalist view would actually go beyond challenging externalist\nintentionalism about consciousness, to upset the metaphysical picture\ncommonly motivating it. For this would be to reject the assumption\nthat mind (conscious mind at least) is not a basic aspect of reality,\nto reject, that is, the idea that it\u2019s a necessary consequence of\ncertain non-mental facts.\n\nThere are yet other routes to a non-reductive intentionalism, less\nmetaphysically bold. One might question the adequacy of various\nreductionist strategies that have been employed for specifying a kind\nof intentionality (or mental representation) that non-circularly\nguarantees phenomenality\u2014as in Tye\u2019s theory. One way\ndoubts can get a grip is by considering variations on the phenomenon\nof \u201cblindsight\u201d\u2014which may be reasonably interpreted\nas involving limited visual discriminatory abilities regarding stimuli\nthat (on account of cortical damage) don\u2019t\nlook\u2014don\u2019t visually appear\u2014anyhow to the\ndiscriminating subject. Can we coherently conceive of some such\nblindsight\u2014a kind of \u201cseeing\u201d without\nvisual consciousness (experience) of the visual stimuli\u2014that\nnonetheless would meet the conditions this or that reductive\nintentionalist is committed to thinking guarantee phenomenal\nvision? Various kinds of enhanced blindsight have been envisaged\n(Block\u2019s superblindsight 1995, 2002; Siewert\u2019s spontaneous\namblyopic blindsight 1998, 2010). We are invited to consider the\nprospect of visually mediated responses, in action and report, to\nstimuli of which the subject lacks visual experience\u2014responses\nthat correspond, in their spontaneity and acuity, to what is afforded\nby very low-grade visual experience. Suppose we can find no\nnon-phenomenal intentional/representational difference, necessarily\ndistinguishing such low-grade visual consciousness from its closest\nblindsight analogue, to which we can reduce the difference between the\ntwo. Then certain prominent versions of reductionism are threatened.\nBut opposition or skepticism regarding all such accounts can coexist\nwith intentionalism in the broadest sense. However, this sort of\nchallenge to reductive intentionalism would leave open questions about\nwhat, if anything, to say about brains in vats, zombies, physicalism,\nand metaphysical basic-ness\u2014and it would even be compatible with\nsome forms of externalism.\n\nThe possibility of non-reductive intentionalism may be evident in\nanother important way, particularly relevant to sense experience.\nReductive intentionalism may seem to require that phenomenal character\nnecessarily supervenes on intentional content\u2014or on this plus\n\u201cintentional mode\u201d (where that encompasses sensory\nmodality). Or, as one might put it, for any phenomenal difference\nthere must be a difference in what properties something is represented\nto have, or a difference in the cognitive mode (or in sensory\nmodality\u2014e.g., visual or tactile) through which it is\nrepresented to have them. But a nonreductive intentionalism is not\ncommitted to such a strong thesis. For one may allow that various\ndifferences in phenomenal character are sufficient for differences in\nintentional features, while holding that there can be differences in\ncharacter without differences in what something is represented to be,\nor in mode/modality of representation. Such would be the case, for\nexample, if one argued (like Block 1990) that two visual experiences\ncould represent the same objective color property on account of\nsharing appropriate causal linkages to the physical environment, even\nthough subjectively the experience of color differed\u2014there was a\ndifference in \u201cmental paint\u201d\u2014in virtue of some\ninternally contrived inversion of what it was like for one to\nexperience color on the two occasions. Independently of such views\nabout the metaphysics of color and visual representation, one might\nmaintain (like Siewert 2005) that the subtle but ubiquitous\ndifferences in the subjective character of experience that come with\nshifts between what is less and what is more \u201cattended-to\u201d\nin the visual field often cannot be justifiably matched to represented\ndifferences in \u201cwhat properties look to be where\u201d. Both\nviews appear incompatible with reductive intentionalism. But both are\nconsistent with the idea that the phenomenal character of visual\nexperience brings intentionality with it\u2014for example, in making\nthings in your environment look to you shaped, sized, or positioned\neither accurately or inaccurately.\n\nPart of what this section aims to make clear is the variety of views\nthat might be seen as intentionalist. Intentionalism may be either\nexternalist or not, reductive or not. Further, intentionalisms may be,\nas already suggested, either more or less restrictive or inclusive\n(and this in various ways). And they may be either completely\nnon-reflexivist, or in some respect reflexivist\u2014where the latter\ncategory is very heterogeneous, and can encompass deeply divergent\nviews. And both of these latter contrasts admit of being developed in\ndiverse, and either reductive or non-reductive ways. Section 6 will\nexplore the inclusive/restrictive contrast and some of the positions\nthat have appeared along this dimension, and Section 7 some varieties\nof reflexivist notions. Before delving into these complications, the\nreader may wonder what is supposed to justify intentionalism, and how\nthe issues of this section might appear from the phenomenological\nperspectives canvassed in Section 3. Discussion of the first question\ncan be found in the supplement,\n Arguments for Intentionalism.\n The second question is discussed in the supplement,\n Phenomenology and Intentionalism.\n",
