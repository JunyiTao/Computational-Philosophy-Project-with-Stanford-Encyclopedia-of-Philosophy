    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Ontology of Lights\n4.2 Ontology of Lights\n\nIn the second part of the Philosophy of Illumination,\nSuhrawardi lays out his light ontology. While some parallels can be\ndrawn with the mystical light epistemology of Muhammad al-Ghazali\n(d.1111) in his Niche of Lights (1998) (cf. PI,\n\u00a7171; Sinai 2016), Suhrawardi develops a distinctly original\ntheory of light. Light and its manifestation are fundamental\nontological principles of his complex metaphysics wherein the\ncontinuous irradiation from the Light of Lights creates and sustains\nthe unity of reality. \n\nThe nature of light, its various manifestations and their\ninterconnectedness determine what exists. All existing things can are\ndivided into four classes of existents (from which Suhrawardi\u2019s\ncosmology is derived). The first category of entities consists of\nself-subsistent \u2018pure\u2019 or \u2018immaterial lights\u2019\nthat are strikingly similar to Leibniz\u2019s\nmonads (Walbridge 2005: 244), those that are associated with the\nPeripatetic intellects. These lights manifest to themselves are aware\nof both themselves and what is other than them. These are causally\nprimary, in terms of existence and of efficiency, though they\n\u201ccan differ in intensity and in luminous and dark\naccidents\u201d (aspects of their individuation). In addition, they\nare now endowed with the capacity to create and to be \u201cmanifest\nto other immaterial lights\u201d. The second category consists of\n\u2018dark barriers\u2019, bodies whose existence depends on\naccidental light to make them manifest (as \u201cthe effects of\nlights\u201d) and that are \u201cknown only by incorporeal\nlights\u201d. The third category consists of \u2018accidental\nlights\u2019, inhering in another, such as physical lights, and the\n\u201cluminous accidents\u201d occurring \u201cin both barriers and\nin immaterial lights\u201d. The last category consists of \u2018dark\naccidents\u2019, the \u201cqualities of physical things that are not\nmanifest in themselves\u201d, but inhering in another (Walbridge\n1992, 49\u201351, 2004, 213\u20134; PI,\n\u00a7\u00a7107\u201313, 121). Thus, what distinguishes quiddities is\nthe degree of their luminous intensity within the ontological\nhierarchies or \u2018grades\u2019 (more or less) of light, from the\nnoblest of light, the Light of Lights (God) to the absence of it\n(matter). \n\nSuhrawardi adopts a familiar \u2018pyramidal structure of levels of\nlight being\u2019, from the Light of lights to the sublunary world.\nHe appeals to two (Peripatetic) principles to uphold the existence of\na first necessary cause \u2014 the Light of Lights \u2014 and all\nthe basic classes of beings (light and darkness, substance and state,\nindependent and dependent beings). A first principle, Walbridge notes,\n\u201cis a form of the principle of sufficient reason, \u2018the\nprinciple of the most noble contingency\u2019 [\u2026] which\nasserts that nothing can exist without a cause of higher ontological\nlevel\u201d (PI, \u00a7\u00a7164\u201373; cf. Paths and\nHavens for Aristotle\u2019s views in On the Heavens;\nSuh. 1993a, 434\u20135). This first principle of \u2018nobler\ncontingency\u2019 (imkan ashraf), central for\nSuhrawardi\u2019s demonstration of the existence of a Light of Light\nthat is ontologically discinct from, though partaking in the\ncontingent of which it is the first cause. A second principle\ncorresponds to the Aristotelian \u201cimpossibility of an ordered,\nactual infinity\u201d which, with the first principle, guarantees\nthat \u201cthere cannot be an infinite number of levels of being and\nthat there must be one being whose existence is necessary in itself\n\u2014 Avicenna\u2019s \u2018Necessary of Existence\u2019\n(wajib al-wujud)\u201d \u2014 and for Suhrawardi, the Light\nof Lights (Walbridge 2000, 24\u20135, 1992, 56\u201361; PI,\n\u00a7\u00a7129\u201338, 55). Mayer (2001) showed that this second\nprinciple was certainly not central to Avicenna\u2019s\ncosmological/ontological argument of the existence of God. From the\nbeing of the One, the Light of Lights, can emanate all the existents\nand the cosmos via a complex interconnected irradiation of light\nintensity (PI, \u00a7150\u20134), varying light intensity\nbringing to life the different \u2018degrees\u2019 of contingent\nimmaterial and material beings, a monist-like ontology of lights that\naccommodates the contingency of all existents irradiated, but\ndistinct, from Light of Lights (cf. Rizvi, 2019, and 2009, ch.2). \n\nWhile light always remains in itself identical, its proximity or\ndistance from the Light of Lights determines the ontic light reality\nof all beings. Their ontological statuses, qualities and influences\nare determined by the different degrees of intensity of light. The\ndistinguishing characteristic is the scale of lights coming into being\nthrough the radiance of light: the greater its radiance, the greater\nits ontological perfection. Reality proceeds from the Light of Lights\nand unfolds via the First Light and all the subsequent dominating and\nmanaging lights whose exponential interactions bring about the\nexistence of all existents. As each new light interacts with other\nexisting lights, more light and dark substances are generated. Light\nproduces both immaterial and substantial lights, such as immaterial\nintellects (angels), human and animal souls. Light produces dusky\nsubstances, such as bodies. In fact, light generates both luminous\naccidents, such as those in immaterial lights, physical lights or\nrays, and dark accidents, whether it be in immaterial lights or in\nbodies (PI, \u00a7\u00a7109\u201310). \n\nAlong with the notion of varying degrees of intensity of light,\nSuhrawardi introduces two hierarchies of immaterial lights: a vertical\norder and a horizontal order. The first vertical order of lights\nproceeds from the Light of Lights. These are the pure and incorporeal\n(mujarrada) dominating (qahira) lights. From the\nLight of Lights proceeds an incorporeal First Light \u2014 following\nthe Neoplatonic principle ex uno non fit nisi unum, i.e.\n\u2018from the one, in so far as it is one, comes only one\u2019\n(principle at the heart of Avicenna\u2019s emanationist\n(fayd) cosmology, cf. Lizzini, 2016, sect. 5.4) \u2014 thus\nassuring ontological dependency of all that comes into existence upon\nthe Light of Lights. From this First Light proceeds a Second Light and\nthe all-encompassing barzakh (highest heaven); from the\nsecond proceeds a Third Light and a second barzakh, or the\nSphere of fixed stars; and so forth (PI, \u00a7141\u20133,\n151\u20132). This vertical order of incorporeal lights is further\ndivided into two classes: the loftier dominating lights \u2014 the\nAvicennan Peripatetic immaterial intellects \u2014 and the managing\n(mudabbira) lights \u2014 the Avicennan Peripatetic\nimmaterial souls of the spheres associated with the various bodies\n(barazikh), as well as the managing Isfahbad light that rules\nover human souls (PI, \u00a7155). Light operates at all\nlevels and hierarchies of reality: irradiation proceeds from higher\ndominating (qahira a\u2018la) lights, whereas the lower\nlights desire the higher ones (PI, \u00a7147). There is a\ncorrelative relation of dominance (qahr) and yearning or love\n(mahabba) between the higher incorporeal lights and the lower\naccidental lights (PI, \u00a7156). \n\nThis vertical hierarchy of lights mirrors the Avicennan Neoplatonic\nprocess of emanation of intellects. Suhrawardi, however, increases the\nnumber of active principles (the Peripatetics immaterial intellects,\nsomething Averroes denounced in Avicenna\u2019s Neoplatonic\nontology). Each of level of immaterial dominating lights is associated\nwith a celestial sphere. They are no longer limited to\nal-Farabi\u2019s (d.950) nine spheres or to those and their\n\u201cvarying number of subordinate spherical bodies\u201d Avicenna\nsuggested with his \u201csecond kinematic model\u201d (Janos 2011,\n172\u20139). This development may have inspired Suhrawardi\u2019s\nindefinite, though not infinite, number of immaterial dominating\n(qahira) lights that are more \u201cthan ten, or twenty, or\none hundred, or [\u2026], or a hundred thousand\u201d, lights that\nare, in fact, as numerous as the stars in the fixed heavens\n(PI, \u00a7151; Arslan 2014, 138\u20139). \n\nThe vertical hierarchy of immaterial dominating lights interacts with\na second horizontal order of dominating lights. Some are equal to\nothers, \u201cbecause the higher lights possess many luminous aspects\nor interact with each other, the existence of other equal dominating\nlights may occur from them [\u2026]. Thus, among the dominating\nlights are mother-lights (ummahat) \u2014 the fundamental\nvertical lights with few and substantial intermediaries \u2014 while\nother are lights horizontal in their ranks from intermediate\nrays\u201d (PI, \u00a7183, 154\u20135). This second\nhorizontal hierarchy of dominating (qawahir) lights is, at\ntimes, associated with \u2018managing angels\u2019 (PI,\n\u00a7248, 259, 269\u201370) (perhaps equal in number to celestial\nbodies; at times, referring to ancient Semitic angelic hierarchies and\nZoroastrian mythology). \n\nBut more importantly, some of the horizontal self-subsisting and\nincorporeal dominating lights are identified as formal dominating\nlights, as \u2018Lords of Species\u2019 (archetypes) or\n\u2018idols\u2019 (arbab al-asnam): \u201cthough they are\nnot imprinted in the barriers (bodies), they occur from each master of\nan idol in its barrier shadow with respect to some exalted luminous\naspect\u201d (PI, 155). These are, at times, labelled the\nPlatonic Forms (muthul Aflatun) (located perhaps at the lower\nthreshold of the world of souls), which Suhrawardi incorporates into\nhis metaphysics, over which rules the Light of Lights (PI,\n\u00a7\u00a7246\u20138; Suh. 1999, 111). Each of those eternal,\nunchanging and pure luminous lights can differ in kind without\ndiffering in ontological level. They are \u201clights of equal\nstrength\u201d that \u201cdiffer from others of the same strength by\nluminous and dark accidents\u201d, some of the lights of this\nhorizontal order being \u201cthe efficient, not the formal, causes of\nnatural kinds\u201d (Walbridge 2017, 270; Suh. 1993a, 67\u20138;\nPI, \u00a7\u00a794\u20135, 164\u201371). The function of\nthose Platonic Forms is analogous to the archetypal Forms of Plato,\nbut only in so far as they govern various species whose exemplars they\nexistentiate (rather than being mere universals), such as the species\nof bodies that move the celestial spheres and being the cosmological\nefficient causes of all sublunar matters, including human souls\n(Walbridge 1992, 61\u20136, 2017, 270\u20131). \n\nOut of the interaction of the irradiations of the vertical and the\nhorizontal lights, the bodies of the lower world are generated. These\ntwo hierarchies of lights are structurally interrelated through the\nprinciple domination (qahr) that the higher lights have over\nthe lower ones and the principle of desire and love (mahabba)\nthat the lower lights have for the higher lights (PI,\n\u00a7\u00a7152\u20136). The increase of dominating immaterial lights\nand the introduction of a second order of horizontal lights (the\nPlatonic Forms) enabled the possibility of simple effects from\ncomposite causes (PI, \u00a7\u00a794\u20135). The two\ndimensional hierarchy of lights introduces a new nonlinear and\ncomposite notion of metaphysical causation. The multiplication of\nmetaphysical entities increases the ontological distance that exists\nbetween the Light of Lights and the sublunar world, while\nsimultaneously providing a greater holistic view of reality, since\nlight lies at its core. Notions of intensity and gradation of light,\ntogether with notions of presence and self-manifestation, are thus\ncentral to Suhrawardi\u2019s metaphysics. The intensity of light\ncorresponds to the degree of the lights self-awareness. Similarly, the\nself-awareness of the Light of Lights encompasses, with varying\ndegrees of intensity, all the other constitutive lights of reality.\nLater, Mulla Sadra (d.1636) will take up Suhrawardi\u2019s insight\nabout the gradation and intensity of light and develop an ontology\ngrounded in the gradation of existence (rather than light) of all\nbeings, somehow reversing Suhrawardi\u2019s ontology with his primacy\nof existence and his understanding of essence as a mental concept.\n\n\nWith his metaphysic of lights, Suhrawardi proposes what he may have\ndeemed a more satisfying argument for the difficult philosophical and\ntheological problem of God\u2019s knowledge of particulars. The\nconcepts of self-knowledge and knowledge by presence, at the heart of\nthe knowledge by presence of all light-beings, provides a means to\nexplain God\u2019s self-awareness, as the Light of Lights, as well as\nIts self-knowledge and It\u2019s knowledge of all things other than\nitself (creation), such as particulars. Knowledge by presence serves\nto explain the presence of God\u2019s knowledge of Itself to Itself,\nas it does for the self-knowledge of all beings of light: \u201cIts\nknowledge of Its essence is Its being a light in Its essence and\nevident to Its essence\u201d. At the same time, God is able to be\naware of what is other than It, such that \u201cIts knowledge of\nthings is their being evident to It, either in themselves or in their\nconnections\u201d (PI, \u00a7162). Hence, God\u2019s\nknowledge by presence is now conceived in terms of the\n\u201cexistence of a \u2018relation\u2019 (idafa) between\nit and whatever is known to it\u201d, whereby this \u201cpurely\nrelational\u201d nature of God\u2019s knowledge enables the Light of\nLight to know material particulars without there being any changes or\neffects on its light substance (Sinai 2013, 320\u20131, 2016,\n288\u201393; Eichner 2001, 137\u20139). For a good overview of\nSuhrawardi\u2019s light ontology, see Walbridge (1992, 40\u201378,\n2004, 212\u20136). \n4.3 World of Images\n\nAbout half a century earlier than Ibn \u2018Arabi (d.1240),\nSuhrawardi introduces an independent \u2018world of images\u2019\n\u2013 what Corbin labelled the mundus imaginalis, a fourth\nontological level (later rejected by Mulla Sadra, see Landolt 2017).\nVan Lit (2017, 7) prefers the translation \u2018world of\nimages\u2019 (or \u2019imaginable world\u2019) over Corbin\u2019s\n\u2018imaginal world\u2019 to render Suhrawardi\u2019s concept of\n\u2018 alam al-mithal. This fourth world lies alongside the\nthree worlds (i) of the intelligible or of the dominating\n(qahira) lights, (ii) of the spiritual, i.e. a soul\nassociated with a body, either human or celestial, or the managing\n(mudabbira) lights, and (iii) of the material or the\n\u2018barriers\u2019 (barzakhiyan) (PI,\n\u00a7246). This independent \u2018world of immaterial shapes\u2019\n(ashbah murajjada) or images (suwar) operates like\nan \u2018isthmus\u2019 or an \u2018intermediary realm\u2019 of\n\u201cdark and illuminated suspended images (suwar\nmu\u2018allaqa)\u201d. It lies somewhere between the physical\nworld of darkness and the world of the \u2018Lords of the\nspecies\u2019 (arbab al-anwa\u2018), i.e. the world of the\nPlatonic Forms of \u2018pure Lights\u2019 (horizontal lights). This\nfourth \u2018world of images\u2019 is where new entities \u2013 the\n\u2018suspended forms\u2019 (muthul mu\u2018allaqa)\n\u2013 exist and which post-mortem souls grasp with their\nimagination. Suhrawardi actually expands on Avicenna\u2019s\nsuggestion that imagination has an important eschatological function\nto explain the fate of souls in the Afterlife (cf. van Lit, 2017,\n20\u201347). \n\nWith the introduction of this \u2018world of images\u2019 ,\nSuhrawardi sought to account for entities that possess an existence of\ntheir own (some, prior to their coming into existence in this world).\nThe \u2018world of images\u2019 contains \u2018suspended\nforms\u2019 that are not embedded in matter, this world being\nconceived as a plane of \u201cghosts, of the forms in mirrors,\ndreams, and worlds of wonder beyond our own\u201d which light can\nexistentiate (Walbridge 2000, 26). The \u2018world of images\u2019\nprovides the material for mystical visions and the miraculous. \n\nIt is where those \u201cwho have attained an intermediate bliss and\nthe ascetics [\u2026] may escape\u201d, a place where they\n\u201ccan and do bring images into beings\u201d, where\neschatological forms and images will be existentiated for the souls of\nthe deceased so that they may continue to perfect their souls, where\n\u201call the promises of prophecies find their reality through\nit\u201d (PI, \u00a7\u00a7244\u20138), as well as where\nelements not fitting conveniently into the Aristotelian scheme of\nforms in matter are found. \n\nThe world of \u2018suspended images\u2019 is distinct from the Forms\nof Plato (muthul Aflatun) that are \u201care luminous, while\nsome of the suspended forms are dark and others illuminated\u201d\n(PI, \u00a7246). The \u2018world of images\u2019 is where\nimages and suspended forms are found that are perceived by the\nsoul\u2019s imaginative power (PI, \u00a7225). Suhrawardi\nnotes, \u201cWhoever sees that station knows with certainty the\nexistence of a world other than that of barriers (barazikh;\ni.e. bodies). In it are self-subsistent [lit.: suspended] images\n(muthul mu\u2018allaqa)\u201d (PI, \u00a7259),\nalthough those suspended forms \u201care in neither a place nor a\nlocus\u201d (PI, \u00a7225; see van Lit 2017). More\nimportantly, Suhrawardi\u2019s \u2018world of images\u2019 and\nsuspended forms plays a novel eschatological function, ensuring that\nimperfect souls may experience posthumously the pains and pleasures of\ndivine retribution by providing an \u2018objective\u2019 status to\nthose \u2018real\u2019 experiences. (PI, \u00a7\u00a7\n244\u20136; Sinai 2015, 280\u20131; van Lit 2017, 37\u201378) (see\n3.1). Suhrawardi did not conceptualize systematically his \u2018world\nof images\u2019 and \u2018suspended forms\u2019. Hence, from the\nthirteen century up to the twenty-first century, quite a few\ncommentators have delved deeper into the matter (van Lit 2017,\n142\u201375). \n5. Politics and Ethics\n\nSuhrawardi\u2019s Philosophy of Illumination carries a\npolitical dimension. Ziai (1992) provides an overview of what he calls\nhis \u2018Illuminationist political doctrine\u2019: it establishes a\nconnection between political authority, just rule, and the\nruler\u2019s access to divine light. For instance, in Tablets to\n\u2018Imad (Suh. 1993c, 186\u20138 [Pers.]), Suhrawardi\nintroduces two Zoroastrian terms kharrah (xwarrah)\nand farrah (Avesta/Pahlavi) to allude to the divine/regal\nlight that was bestowed upon ancient kings; in the Book of\nRadiance, it is the Light of Lights that bestows upon them\nluminous glory and power (kharra-yi kayani) (Suh. 1998,\n84\u20135, cf. 1993c, 81; Gnoli 1999); and in the Philosophy of\nIllumination, it corresponds to the light of the Kingdom of Power\n(malakut) that Kay Khusraw and Zarathustra were able to\nbehold (PI, \u00a7\u00a7165\u20136; cf. 1993a, 502\u20135).\n\n\nThis political \u2018doctrines\u2019 provides indications of the\nconditions able to guarantee the reign of the just rule, thus\nproviding elements of an Illuminationist political ethic of the\nSage-ruler. However, the general framework of the ethics underlying\nSuhrawardi\u2019s ishraqi system requires further\ninvestigation. His particularly Platonic understanding of the mystic\nqua ruler and his political role, coupled with the role of intuitive\nor \u2018mystical\u2019 access to the \u2018divine\u2019 lights by\nprophets, mystics and sages might, however, not leave Suhrawardi\nimmune to the same criticism Popper leveled against Plato. \n\nSuhrawardi may, in fact, appeal to a somewhat\n\u2018mythological\u2019 genealogy of the transmission of ancient\nIllumination/ishraqi philosophies from the Greek/West and the\nIranian/East which he claims to revive. Ziai (1992, 337; cf. Walbridge\n2000, 201\u201310) speculates that he tried to put into practice the\npolitical dimension (i.e. a \u2018new\u2019 political doctrine) of\nhis ishraqi philosophy, based mainly on passages from his\nworks and considering the possible circumstances of his demise and\nexecution. Historical data supporting the thesis, Suhrawardi\u2019s\nrelationship with his many patrons and the purpose of passages\nrelating to these Illuminationist political doctrines need further\nexamination to confirm the claim (Marcotte 2001a, 415\u20136). \n\nSuhrawardi\u2019s eschatology \u2014 the Return \u2014 and his\ndiscussions on the fate of the soul in the afterlife offers a glimpse\nof what might constitute a \u2018good\u2019 and ethical life in this\nworld. In line with Avicenna\u2019s classification of souls in the\nhereafter according to their worldly acquisition of practical and\ntheoretical knowledge, the moral qualities developed in this life\ndetermine the fate of souls in the afterlife (PI,\n\u00a7\u00a7244\u20138). In search of felicity, souls must attempt to\ndetach themselves from their tenebrous bodies and all that is worldly\nand material and seek to access the world of immaterial lights. Souls\nengrossed in matter in this life partially determine their fate in the\nafterlife. In this respect, Suhrawardi does not depart greatly from\nAvicenna\u2019s Peripatetic eschatology (see 4.3). \n\nProphets, saints and exceptionally gifted mystics are the ones best\nable to achieve conjunction with the world of pure lights. Ascetic\npractices in this life can become a means to attain self-consciousness\nof the ontic light reality of the soul. Some of Suhrawardi\u2019s\nallegorical and mystical treatises, like The Treatise of the\nBird, A Tale of Occidental Exile or A Day with a\nGroup of Sufis (Suh. 1993b, 274\u201397, 1999b, 2001, 1976),\nprovide examples of the pedagogical role and instruction of the guide\nfigure, of the Lord of the human species, or of spiritual entities to\nthe novice in his or her quest for the immaterial world of lights in\nwhich salvation lies. The posthumous life of individual souls and\ntheir ability to perceive the promised other-worldly rewards and\npunishments become conditions for divine retribution. \n6. Suhrawardi\u2019s Legacy\n6.1 Post-Suhrawardian Traditions\n\nSuhrawardi\u2019s tragic end marked the beginning of a long history\nof commentaries by both proponents and detractors of his novel\nreassessment of the Avicennan Peripatetic tradition. By the end of the\n13th century, at least two of his works were readily\navailable and studied in the major centers of learning of Syria\n(Damascus and Aleppo), Iraq (Baghdad) and Iran (Maraghah), some of\nwhich circulating most probably before his death. Two major trends\nwithin the commentarial tradition of the 13th century were\nto shape later developments: one wass exemplified by Ibn Kammuna\n(d.1284) who emphasizes the \u201cpurely discursive and the more\nsystematically philosophical\u201d aspects of Suhrawardi\u2019s\nworks, and the other was exemplified by Shahrazuri (d.ca.1288) who\nfocuses on, and expands the symbolic and the allegorical aspects of\nwhat came to be known as the ishraqi tradition (Ziai 2003,\n473\u201387). \n\nIbn Kammuna, a Jewish philosopher greatly influenced by both Avicenna\nand Suhrawardi, is the first commentator (Langermann 2005,\n297\u2013301; Pourjavady and Schmidtke 2006, 23\u201332; Eichner\n2010) who, while in Baghdad, completes in 1268 his commentary on the\nlogic, physics and the metaphysics of Intimations (Ibn\nKammuna 2003, 2009). Having resided in Aleppo, he could well be, with\nsuch works as The Revealer, completed in 1278 (2008;\nLangermann 2005), the link between Suhrawardi and Shahrazuri who\nwrites the earliest commentary on the Philosophy of\nIllumination (ca. 1286), after having written a commentary on\nIntimations (Shahrazuri 1993; cf. Marcotte 2002).\nShahrazuri\u2019s encyclopedic Metaphysical Tree, also\nwritten before his commentary on the Philosophy of\nIllumination (Shahrazuri, 2004 and 2005 [a better edition]),\nwould contain some ishraqi elements, although it remains to\nbe ascertained whether his Divine Symbols and Proverbs does\n(Privot\n 2004).[2]\n\nMore work is needed to determine the extent and the nature of\nShahrazuri\u2019s contribution to what came to be known as an\n\u2018Illuminationist\u2019 tradition. Van Lit (2017, 79\u2013112)\nprovides a good example of how focussing on a particular doctrinal\nelement can yield much insight into Shahrazuri\u2019s contribution,\nnamely giving expression and stabalising the name of the \u2018world\nof images\u2019, its location and topography, the means to access it,\nits reality, etc. (see also Marcotte 2001b, 2002). In 1295, Qutb\nal-Din Shirazi completes his own commentary on the Philosophy of\nIllumination (Shirazi 2001; Suh. 1986), which supplanted\nShahrazuri\u2019s commentary (Walbridge 1992). \n\nAuthors that incorporated or commented and discussed isharaqi\nideas include (Isma\u2018il ibn) Muhammad Ibn Rizi (fl.ca.1280), in\nhis Life of Souls (Marcotte 2004); Athir al-Din al-Abhari\n(d.1242) in a number of his works (Eichner 2012); \u2018Allamah Hilli\n(d.1325), who pens a commentary on the Philosophy of\nIllumination (now lost), and solutions to issues raised in\nSuhrawardi\u2019s Intimations (completed before 1293) and\nOpposites; Sayyid Sharif al-Jurjani (d.1414) writes a\ncommentary on the Philosophy of Illumination (Kadivar 2011,\n290\u20132); Ibn Abi Jumhur Ahsa\u2019i (d.1501) (Schmidtke 2000);\nNajm al-Din Mahmud al-Nayrizi (d.ca.1526), a critic of Suhrawardi,\ncompletes in 1526 his commentary on Tablets to \u2018Imad\n(Pourjavady 2011, 131\u20136, 137\u201352); the two theologians\nJalal al-Din al-Dawani (d.1501) and Ghiyath al-Din al-Dashtaki\n(d.1542) write commentaries on his Temples of Light (Dawani\n1953; Dashtaki 2003; Suh. 1996); and \u2018Abd al-Razzaq (Fayyaz)\nLahiji (d.1667), one of Mulla Sadra\u2019s students, would have also\nwritten a commentary on Temples of Light. \n\nMulla Sadra (Sadr al-Din al-Shirazi) (d.1636), who was most interested\nin Suhrawardi\u2019s critique of Avicennan Peripateticism (existence\nas a being of reason, the Platonic forms, knowledge by presence,\neschatology), writes marginal glosses on the Philosophy of\nIllumination and on Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi\u2019s commentary on\nthe work (Mulla Sadra 2010; cf. Suh. 1986; Landolt 2017). Mulla Sadra,\nlike Hadi Sabzawari (d.1873), upholds the principality of existence\n(wujud), in opposition to what he understood to be\nSuhrawardi\u2019s view that quiddity was primary over existence, a\nview shared by Mir Damad (d.1631) (cf. his Spiritual\nAttractions [2001] and Divine Embers [2001]). \n\nDuring the same period, Suhrawardi\u2019s works enter the Turkish\nOttoman and Persian Indian philosophical traditions. In the Ottoman\nworld, Isma\u2018il Ankaravi (d.1631), a member of the Mevlevi Sufi\norder, translates and comments Temples of Light in his\nElucidation of Wisdoms (Kuspinar 1996). During the\n17th century, the enigmatic Ahmad Ibn al-Harawi (probably\nfrom Herat), who lived in the Indian subcontinent, translates the\nPhilosophy of Illumination into Persian on which he writes a\ncommentary (Harawi 1979). Azar Kayvan (d.ca.1615), a Zoroastrian high\npriest from Fars, who emigrated to Gujurat in Mughal India during the\nreign of Emperor Akbar (r.1556\u20131605), starts a Zoroastrian\nishraqi school (Walbridge 2001, 91\u20133). Muhammad\n\u2018Ali Hazin Lahiji (d.1667) writes a commentary on\nSuhrawardi\u2019s Words of Sufism (Suh. 2001, 101\u201339;\n1993d), along with glosses and notes on three other of his works,\nincluding the Philosophy of Illumination (Kadivar 2011,\n290\u20132). Even thinkers of the 20th century, such as\nMuhammad Kazim \u2018Assar (d.1975) and his discussion of\n\u201cequivocal being\u201d, have been influenced by\nishraqielements (Ziai 2003, 472). Van Lit provides a\nchronological sketch of eighteen commentators on Suhrawardi, including\nlesser-known ones (2018, 548\u201353). Cataloguing and making\naccessible hundreds of philosophical works in Arabic and Persian from\nthe 12th\u201319th century, like the recent\npublication of the Persian Inner Light (2012) of Shihab\nal-Din Kumijani (d.1895), are bound to shed new light on\nSuhrawardi\u2019s legacy. \n\nAlthough very little has been written on the history of the\nphilosophical legacy of Suhrawardi\u2019s novel ishraqi\nideas and doctrines, how is one to understand claims made about the\nexistence of a truly original and distinct \u2018Illuminationist\ntradition\u2019? Some are more cautious in their assessment of\nSuhrawardi\u2019s project and legacy. Van Lit (2017, 2\u20133,\n6\u20137), for example, questions Corbin and others who have deemed\nwhat is often labelled the \u2018Illuminationist\u2019 or\nisraqi tradition a \u2018school of thought\u2019, and offer\na corrective assessment with his detailed study on the notion of\n\u2013 suspended images \u2013 and the \u2018world of image\u2019.\nLandolt (2008, 235) also nuanced such claims, like those of Ziai\namongst others, regarding the existence of a truly Suhrawardian\n\u2018Illuninationist\u2019 tradition conceived as a philosohpical\n(hikma) system radically different from Avicenna\u2019s\nPeripateticism. Suhrawardi\u2019s project needs to be recast as a\ncritique of the latter\u2019s brand of Peripateticism, similar to the\nvarious critiques put forward by Shahrastani (d.1153), Abu al-Barakat\nal-Baghdadi (d.ca.1165), Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d.1210) and\nal-Ghazali(d.1111), etc. \n6.2 Historiography\n\nTwo main schools of thought dominate the historiography of the\nIlluminationist tradition. The first, more prevalent and older school,\nviews Suhrawardi as the founder of a mystical, or\n\u2018theosophical\u2019 tradition. Henry Corbin, the father of\ncontemporary Suhrawardiana studies, introduced this paradigm\n(Gutas 2002, 16\u20139). \n\nHis interest in the Shaykh al-ishraq rested primarily with\nthe latter\u2019s hikmat al-ishraq, Corbin\u2019s\n\u2018Oriental theosophy\u2019 \u2014 the lost mythological\ntraditions of the Ancient sages of the West and the East \u2014\nSuhrawardi was reviving, also with his Persian allegories, (views\nshared by Nasr). Interested mainly in his mystical views and\nmetaphysics of light and irradiation, he saw little interest in\nediting Suhrawardi\u2019s works on logic and physics. These\n\u2018gnostic\u2019/\u2018mystic\u2019,\n\u2018esoteric\u2019/\u2018theosophical\u2019 wisdom, or even\npre-Aristotelian philosophia perennis or universalis\n(Nasr 1964, 60\u20133) approaches to Suhrawardi\u2019s works often\noveremphasize the mystical and the theosophical at the expense of the\nphilosophical, and thus blur the distinction between philosophy,\ntheology and mysticism (cf. Pourjavady 2013). Proponents of this\napproach highlight Suhrawardi\u2019s aim to expound on\nAvicenna\u2019s incomplete project to develop an\n\u2018Eastern\u2019 (mashriqiyya) (not\n\u2018illuminative\u2019) philosophy of Khurasan, in spite of the\nfact that Avicenna\u2019s \u2018Eastern\u2019 philosophy was not a\nmystical enterprise; rather, it aimed at developing a philosophical\ntradition distinct from the \u2018Western\u2019 philosophical school\nof Baghdad (Gutas 2000). Many scholars often overlook the fact that\nSuhrawardi\u2019s major works are largely devoted to technical\nphilosophical questions and theories of which even his allegorical or\nminor works are not devoid. More generally, the proponents of the\nmystical approach interpret Suhrawardi\u2019s ishraqiviews\nas a break or a departure from the philosophical tradition. Some, like\nFakhry (1982), go so far as to question the originality of the\nisharqi elements of his work, deeming it a mere transposition\nof Avicennan philosophy into a light terminology. \n\nThe second, more recent school, views the novel elements of\nSuhrawardi\u2019s ishraqi system as an original\nphilosophical \u2018critique\u2019 \u2014 in the wake of the\nreassessments of Abu al-Barakat al-Baghdadi, Fakhr al-Din al-Razi and\nal-Ghazali \u2014 a reconfiguration of Avicennan Peripateticism, an\ninterpretation adopted by a great many of his medieval commentators.\nSome contemporary commentators, like Izutsu (1971), explore the\nanalytical aspect of Suhrawardi\u2019s work; others, like Mehdi\nHa\u2019iri Yazdi (1992) and Jalal al-Din Ashtiyani, propose\n\u2018Neo-Avicennan\u2019 interpretations of the ishraqi\ntradition (Amin Razavi 2013, xvii\u2013xix). Ziai (1990) focuses\nprimarily on his logic; whereas Walbridge (1992) studied, first, the\nwork of Qutb al-Din Shirazi (d.1311), and then the philosophical\nheritage of Ancient sages and wisdoms (Greeks, Stoic, Platonic, etc.;\npre-Socratics; Persians, etc.) of Suhrawardi\u2019s ishraqi\nsystem (2000, 2001, etc.). \n\nWhile some, like Corbin (1971), Nasr (1964) and Mohammad Mo\u2019in\n(1948, 1950), view Suhrawardi as the reviver of some ancient form of\nPersian philosophy; some, like Shahab Ahmed (d. 2015) have\noveremphasized his role within the Islamic\n East[3];\n still others are more skeptical. For example, Ziai (2003, 484) notes\nthe absence of an independent textual Persian philosophical tradition,\nalthough he believes that the Islamic ishraqi philosophical\ntradition incorporated \u201cMazdayasnian sentiments kept alive in\npopular and oral traditions and in poetic, epic and mystical\ncompositions\u201d. Gutas (2003) also notes the lack of any textual\nevidence to support claims that Suhrawardi attempted to revive ancient\nWestern Greek, Gnostic, and Hermetic traditions and suggests focusing\nresearch on the reasons why Suhrawardi appeals to the authority of the\n\u2018Ancients\u2019, East and West, rather than trying to find\n\u2018real\u2019 historical filiations to sources to which he\nmight have had access. \n\nSince the 1990s, interest in Suhrawardi\u2019s work and\nishraqi philosophical system and its reception was rekindled\n(Ziai 1990; Walbridge 1992, 2000, 2001; Amin Razavi 2004). However,\nalthough some recent scholarship has focused on his critique of\nAvicennan Peripatetic views, as well as explored a number of more\nspecific logical, physical, psychological, epistemological,\nontological, and metaphysical issues of Suhrawardi\u2019s major\nArabic works, further studies is still needed to add to our knowledge\nof the influence of Avicenna\u2019s major works (Cure,\nPointers and Reminders, even Discussions),\nas well as the influence of the Arabic Platonic and Neoplatonic\ntraditions in the form they would have been available to him. Eichner\n(2011, 140) suggests any \u201cinterpretation of Suhrawardian texts\nmust avoid simply assuming that they were rendered correctly by later\ninterpretations, which sought to present a unified and coherent\naccount of his system and the relation of that system to\nPeripateticism\u201d. This methodological principle would help\nrevisit Suhrawardi\u2019s work, and to produce much-needed studies on\nthe works of authors who belonged to, or were influenced by various\nand novel ishraqi elements (cf. Gheissari et al.\n2018), to chart the complex historical and philosophical developments\nof what was to become known as a novel \u2018Illuminationist\u2019\ntradition. This would undoubtedly provide new insights into his\ndistinctly Platonic reworking of Avicennan Peripateticism, what Gutas\n(2002) has identified as Suhrawardi\u2019s \u2018Illuminationist\nAvicennism\u2019.",
