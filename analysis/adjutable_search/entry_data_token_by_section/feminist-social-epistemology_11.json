    "main_text": "Epistemic Values, Ethics, and Democracy || Epistemologies of Ignorance\n4.3 Democratic Structures of Knowledge Production\n\n\nA third area of discussion in which feminists have directly\nconnected epistemic with social and ethical goals concerns the role of\ndemocratic structures in the production of knowledge. In part as a\nresponse to such challenges as epistemic injustice and the ways in\nwhich the production of ignorances helps support structures of\ndomination, feminists have developed normative remedies that include\nmore democratic epistemic institutions and practices. Several different\nlines of argument can be identified for why and how democratic\npractices can be epistemically beneficial.\n\n\nSome feminists have focused squarely on the internal democratic\nconditions of epistemic communities required for objectivity. For\nexample, Longino\u2019s social process-based idea of objectivity\nrequires a practice of open discussion and critical engagement between\nmembers of epistemic communities, in order to ensure that the knowledge\nproduced is objective in the sense of having withstood appropriate\ncritical scrutiny. Importantly, Longino includes conditions of tempered\nintellectual authority and uptake of criticism for the participants of\nepistemic communities (2002), arguing that objectivity can only be\nsuccessfully pursued in situations where knowers are respected for\ntheir epistemic contributions and not ignored or assigned less\ncredibility because of who they are. In a related vein, Elizabeth Anderson\n(1995c) argues explicitly that the aims of higher education demand that\nissues of justice and equality of respect within the academy be taken\nup as epistemic issues, securing the ability of all to contribute their\nideas to the public discourse and have those ideas taken seriously.\nKristina Rolin similarly points to the epistemic need for social and\ncultural norms within scientific communities that promote inclusive and\nresponsive dialogue, and worries about the distorting effects on the\ncredibility of women scientists operating within cultures of\nprofessional interaction that conflate masculine styles of presentation\nwith competence (Rolin 2002). Many have also drawn attention to the\nfact that the critical engagement called for by the likes of Longino\nand Anderson will only be epistemically effective if a diversity of\nperspectives are represented within that particular epistemic\ncommunity. Longino explicitly acknowledges the importance of diverse\nrepresentation in order to expose questionable background assumptions\nthat can be invisible when shared by a group of similarly situated\nknowers (Longino 2002). Others have examined in more detail the links\nbetween diversity in social situation and diversity in epistemic\nperspectives. For example, Kristen Intemann argues that the epistemic\nvalue of diversity comes from a diversity of experiences being\nrepresented at the table, not a diversity of values or interests\nper se (Intemann 2011). Still others have examined in detail\nthe role of \u201cchilly climate\u201d issues within epistemic\ncommunities (Wylie 2011), and the structural and motivational barriers\nto change that are present within academic institutions (Fehr 2011),\nboth factors which contribute to the difficulty of reaping the\nepistemic benefits of diversity within epistemic communities. These\narguments suggest that our epistemic projects are harmed when social\nrelations conspire to either exclude particular knowers from relevant\nepistemic communities, or more insidiously deny them the credibility\nand epistemic respect they deserve within those communities.\n\n\nOthers have argued that outside of specific epistemic communities\nthemselves, society-wide improvements in social justice are required so\nthat sexist and androcentric biases do not continue to weaken our\nscientific practices (Kourany 2010). Naomi Scheman has argued that\ninsofar as scientific communities and institutions fail to be\ntrustworthy from the perspective of marginalized groups who have\nexperienced a poor historical relationship with them, those\ninstitutions fail in achieving objectivity, given that the function of\nobjectivity is to rationally ground trust (Scheman 2001). According to\nsuch arguments, epistemic improvement requires improvement to the\nstructure of our social relations understood more broadly than just\ninside the epistemic communities themselves. Situations of oppression,\nand the marginalization of groups within society damage the epistemic\npotential of both specific epistemic communities and society at\nlarge.\n\n\nFinally, many feminist social epistemologists explicitly invoke\ndemocratic goals as guides for the direction of research. Arguments\nhere build upon the idea that that knowledge is limited, and cannot be\nassumed to serve the interests of everyone equally. Sandra Harding, for\nexample, calls for \u201cthe reinvention of sciences for the many to\nreplace sciences that are often only for the elite few\u201d (1991,\n312). Heidi Grasswick builds upon Scheman\u2019s line of reasoning\nconcerning the need for scientific institutions to be trustworthy from\nparticular social vantage points. She argues that among the\nrequirements for such trustworthiness, there must be available evidence\nthat scientific institutions are taking up at least some research\nquestions that are significant for the social group in question and\nproviding meaningful answers to those questions. Furthermore, she notes\nthat engagement and sound communication between scientific and\nvariously situated lay communities are required in order to establish\nthe necessary trusting relations that would allow for particularly\nsituated lay persons to responsibly rely on scientific institutions for\ntheir knowledge (Grasswick 2010). Broadening the scope beyond just\nscientific practices, Lorraine Code argues for a guiding ecological\nprinciple of cohabitability in epistemic decision-making\n(2006). Ultimately, she argues, we should select directions of research\nand methods of research that permit and foster our living well amongst\none another, clearly bringing an ethical dimension into epistemic\ndecision-making.\n\n\nIn various ways then, feminist social epistemologists have argued\nfor deep connections between democracy and the success of epistemic\npractices. They have attended to the effects of social relations\ninternal to epistemic communities, social relations external to those\ncommunities, and social relations between knowledge-producing\ncommunities and lay communities.\n",
