    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophical debate in 19th century Scotland was very\nvigorous, its agenda being set in large part by the impact of Kant and\nGerman Idealism on the philosophical tradition of the Scottish\nEnlightenment. The principal figures are Thomas Brown, Sir William\nHamilton, James Frederick Ferrier and Alexander Bain, and later in the\ncentury, the so-called \u201cScottish Idealists\u201d notably James\nHutchison Stirling, Edward Caird, and D.G. Ritchie. The\nself-conscious identity of the Scottish philosophical tradition owes\nmuch to James McCosh, a Scottish born and educated philosopher who\nbecame President of the College of New Jersey, later Princeton\nUniversity,and straddling the 19th and 20th centuries, Andrew Seth\nPringle Pattison.\n",
