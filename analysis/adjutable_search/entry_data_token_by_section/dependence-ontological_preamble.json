    "main_text": "\n\nOntological dependence is a relation\u2014or, more accurately, a\nfamily of relations\u2014between entities or beings\n(onta in Greek, whence ontological). For there are\nvarious ways in which one being may be said to depend upon\none or more other beings, in a sense of \u201cdepend\u201d that is\ndistinctly metaphysical in character and that may be\ncontrasted, thus, with various causal senses of this word.\nMore specifically, a being may be said to depend, in such a sense,\nupon one or more other beings for its existence or for its\nidentity. A traditional approach was to analyze all forms of\nontological dependence in modal terms, that is, in terms of\ndistinctly metaphysical notions of possibility and necessity,\nbut more recently an analysis in terms of the notion of essence\nhas become popular. A third option is to treat the notion of\nontological dependence as a metaphysical primitive, in which\ncase it is not possible to give a further definition of it. This entry\nwill remain neutral about the ultimate basis of ontological\ndependence. At least in some cases, it is possible to use ontological\ndependence as a tool to describe the relationship between entities\nwithout taking a stand about its basis, but in other cases this may\nnot be possible. Notions of ontological dependence are frequently\ncalled upon by metaphysicians in their proposed analyses of other\nmetaphysically important notions, such as the notion of\nsubstance or the thought that tropes depend for\ntheir existence on a substance.\n",
