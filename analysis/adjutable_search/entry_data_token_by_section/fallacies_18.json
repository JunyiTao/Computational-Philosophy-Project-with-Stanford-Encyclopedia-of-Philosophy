    "main_text": "Current issues in fallacy theory || Teaching\n4.3 Teaching\n\nOn the more practical level, there continues to be discussion about\nthe value of teaching the fallacies to students. Is it an effective\nway for them to learn to reason well and to avoid bad arguments? One\nreason to think that it is not effective is that the list of fallacies\nis not complete, and that even if the group of core fallacies was\nextended to incorporate other fallacies we thought worth including, we\ncould still not be sure that we had a complete prophylactic against\nbad arguments. Hence, we are better off teaching the positive criteria\nfor good arguments/ argumentation which give us a fuller set of\nguidelines for good reasoning. But some (Pragma-dialectics and Johnson\nand Blair) do think that their stock of fallacies is a complete guard\nagainst errors because they have specified a full set of necessary\nconditions for good arguments/argumentation and they hold that\nfallacies are just failures to meet one of these conditions.\n\nAnother consideration about the value of the fallacies approach to\nteaching good reasoning is that it tends to make students overly\ncritical and lead them to see fallacies where there are not any;\nhence, it is maintained we could better advance the instilling of\ncritical thinking skills by teaching the positive criteria of good\nreasoning and arguments (Hitchcock, 1995). In response to this view,\nit is argued that, if the fallacies are taught in a non-perfunctory\nway which includes the explanations of why they are\nfallacies\u2014which normative standards they transgress\u2014then a\ncourse taught around the core fallacies can be effective in instilling\ngood reasoning skills (Blair 1995).\n",
