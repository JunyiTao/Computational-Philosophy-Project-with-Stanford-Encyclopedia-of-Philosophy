    "main_text": "The Metaphysics of Common Sense Inertia\n5. The Frame Problem Today\n\n\nThe narrow, technical frame problem generated a great deal of work\nin logic-based artificial intelligence in the late 1980s and early 1990s,\nand its wider philosophical implications came to the fore at around the\nsame time. But the importance each thinker accords to the frame problem\ntoday will typically depend on their stance on other matters.\n\n\nWithin classical AI, a variety of workable solutions to the logical\nframe problem have been developed, and it is no longer considered a\nserious obstacle even for those working in a strictly logic-based\nparadigm (Shanahan 1997; Reiter 2001; Shanahan 2003; Lifschitz 2015).\nIt's worth\nnoting that logically-minded AI researchers can consistently retain\ntheir methodology and yet, to the extent that they view their products\npurely as engineering, can reject the traditional cognitive\nscientist's belief in the importance of computation over\nrepresentations for understanding the mind.  Moreover, insofar as the\ngoal of classical AI is not computers with human-level intelligence,\nbut is simply the design of better and more useful computer programs,\nit is immune to the philosophical objections of Fodor, Dreyfus, and\nthe like.  Significantly though, for AI researchers working outside\nthe paradigm of symbolic representation altogether\u2014those\nworking in situated robotics, for example\u2014the logical frame\nproblem simply doesn't feature in day-to-day investigations.\n\n\nAlthough it can be argued that it arises even in a\n connectionist setting (Haselager &\nVan Rappard 1998; Samuels 2010), the frame problem inherits much of its\nphilosophical significance from the classical assumption of the\nexplanatory value of computation over representations, an assumption\nthat has been under vigorous attack for some time (Clark 1997; Wheeler\n2005).  Despite this, many philosophers of mind, in the company of\nFodor and Pylyshyn, still subscribe to the view that human mental\nprocesses consist chiefly of inferences over a set of propositions,\nand that those inferences are carried out by some form of computation.\nTo such philosophers, the epistemological frame problem and its\ncomputational counterpart remain a genuine threat.\n For Wheeler and others, classical AI and cognitive science rest on\nCartesian assumptions that need to be overthrown in favour of a more\nHeideggerian stance before the frame problem can be overcome (Dreyfus\n2008; Wheeler 2005; 2008; Rietveld 2012).  According to Wheeler (2005;\n2008), the situated robotics movement in AI that originated with the\nwork of Brooks (1991) exemplifies the right way to go.  Dreyfus is in\npartial agreement, but contends that the early products of situated\nrobotics \u201cfinesse rather than solve the frame problem\u201d\nbecause \u201cBrooks's robots respond only to fixed isolable features\nof the environment, not to context or changing significance\u201d\n(Dreyfus 2008, 335).  Dreyfus regards the neurodynamics work of\nFreeman (2000) as a better foundation for the sort of Heideggerian\napproach to AI in which the frame problem might be dissolved (see also\nShanahan 2010, Ch.5; Rietveld 2012; Bruineberg & Rietveld\n2014). Dreyfus is impressed by Freeman's approach because the\nneurodynamical record of significance is neither a representation nor\nan association, but (in dynamical systems terms) \u201ca repertoire\nof attractors\u201d that classify possible responses, \u201cthe\nattractors themselves being the product of past experience\u201d\n(Dreyfus 2008, 354).\n\n\nOne philosophical legacy of the frame problem is that it has drawn\nattention to a cluster of issues relating to holism, or so-called\ninformational unencapsulation.\nRecall that a process is informationally unencapsulated (Fodor sometimes\nuses the term \u201cisotropic\u201d) if there is no a priori\nboundary to what information is relevant to it.\nIn recent writing, Fodor uses the term \u201cframe\nproblem\u201d in the context of all informationally unencapsulated\nprocesses, and not just those to do with inferring the consequences\nof change (Fodor 2000, Ch.2; Fodor 2006, Ch.4).\nIt's clear that idealised rationality is informationally\nunencapsulated, in this sense.\nIt has also been suggested that isotropy is damaging to the so-called\n theory theory\n of folk psychology (Heal 1996).\n(For Heal, this lends support to the rival\n simulation theory,\n but Wilkerson (2001) argues that informational unencapsulation is a\nproblem for both accounts of folk psychology.)\nAnalogical reasoning, as Fodor says, is an example of \u201cisotropy\nin the purest form: a process which depends precisely upon the transfer\nof information among cognitive domains previously assumed to be\nirrelevant\u201d (Fodor 1983, 105).\nArguably, a capacity for analogical and metaphorical\nthinking\u2014a talent for creatively transcending the boundaries\nbetween different domains of understanding\u2014is the source of\nhuman cognitive prowess (Lakoff & Johnson 1980; Mithen 1996). So\nthe informational unencapsulation of analogical reasoning is potentially\nvery troublesome, and especially so for modular theories of mind in which\nmodules are viewed as (context-insensitive) specialists\n(Carruthers 2003; 2006).\n Dreyfus claims that this \u201cextreme version of the frame\nproblem\u201d is no less a consequence of the Cartesian assumptions\nof classical AI and cognitive science than its less demanding\nrelatives (Dreyfus 2008, 361). He advances the view that a suitably\nHeideggerian account of mind is the basis for dissolving the frame\nproblem here too, and that our \u201cbackground familiarity with how\nthings in the world behave\u201d is sufficient, in such cases, to\nallow us to \u201cstep back and figure out what is relevant and\nhow\u201d.  Dreyfus doesn't explain how, given the holistic,\nopen-ended, context-sensitive character of relevance, this\nfiguring-out is achieved. But Wheeler, from a similarly Heideggerian\nposition, claims that the way to address the\n\u201cinter-context\u201d frame problem, as he calls it, is with a\ndynamical system in which \u201cthe causal contribution of each\nsystemic component partially determines, and is partially determined\nby, the causal contributions of large numbers of other systemic\ncomponents\u201d (Wheeler 2008, 341).  A related proposal is put\nforward by Shanahan and Baars (2005; see also Shanahan 2010, Ch.6),\nbased on global workspace theory (Baars 1988), according to which the\nbrain incorporates a solution to the problem of informational\nunencapsulation by instantiating an architecture in which a) the\nresponsibility for determining relevance is not centralised but is\ndistributed among parallel specialist processes, and b) a serially\nunfolding global workspace state integrates relevant contributions\nfrom multiple domains.\n",
