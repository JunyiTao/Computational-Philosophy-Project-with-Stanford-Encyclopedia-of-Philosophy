    "main_text": "Points of Dispute || Modality & Cognition\n6. Conclusion\n\nThis article has examined the ongoing interpretive debate concerning\nKant\u2019s conception of the contribution of the sensible and\nintellectual faculties of the mind to a subject\u2019s sensory\nexperience of the world around it. Two central motivations of the\ndebate are, on the one hand, philosophical concerns about the\nepistemological relationship between sensory experience (broadly\nconstrued) and empirical judgment or belief, and on the other hand,\ninterpretive questions concerning Kant\u2019s conception of the\ncognitive role of intuition and his strategy of argument in the\nTranscendental Deduction. We have seen that there are multiple ways of\nframing the debate, and that even basic issues, such as the central\nlocus of dispute (whether it be intuition, perception, or experience)\nadmit of multiple approaches. Moreover, we saw that the framing of the\ndispute in terms of conceptual content yields various problems, and\nperhaps in part because of such problems current debate seems to have\ncoalesced (either implicitly or explicitly) around an alternative\nframe\u2014viz. whether the generation of intuition depends on, or is\notherwise an expression of, intellectual capacities of one sort or\nanother. Resolution of this question requires navigation of some of\nthe thorniest and most contentious areas of Kant\u2019s philosophy.\nFor this reason, at least, it seems unlikely that we will soon see any\nwidespread convergence on an answer.\n",
