    "main_text": "The Justifications for Precedent || Law-making\n3.4 Law-making\n\n\nA final justification for the doctrine of precedent is that it is\ndesirable to give courts the power to make law. The thought\nhere is that it is valuable for the courts to have the power to\nimprove and supplement the law (Hart 1994, 135\u20136; Raz 1979,\n194\u2013201). The assumption underlying this justification is that\nthe law is sometimes incomplete and in need of being given greater\nspecificity, or that it is erroneous and needs to be corrected.  On\nthis view the courts are analogous to delegated legislators: they have\nlimited powers to make law within a broader framework of doctrine.\n\n\nAlthough the need for law-making is often cited as a justification for\nprecedent, the substance of the argument normally boils down to\nconcerns with either equality or replicability. If the law has\nresolved an indeterminacy in one (acceptable) way in the past, then\nprecedent helps to ensure that future litigants are treated as\n(un)favourably as past litigants, and so all are treated equally. In\naddition, if the application of the law is indeterminate, due to the\ntype of value conflict involved or the nature of the decision-makers,\nthen it is desirable for judicial decisions to constitute precedents\nin order to make the law more replicable in the future. \n\n\nOn the other hand, if the argument in favour of courts having\nlaw-making power is that they can thereby improve the law, this is\nreally an argument in favour of having the power to overrule\nprecedents, rather than an argument in favour of precedent in the\nfirst place. Indeed, the need for a power to overrule only arises if\nearlier decisions are binding even when mistaken, since later courts\ncould otherwise simply disregard decisions that were erroneous.  So\nthe argument from law-making, when distinct from arguments from\nreplicability and equality, is an argument for the power to overrule,\nrather than an argument for stare decisis\n itself.[16] \n\n\nIn conclusion, both equality and replicability provide arguments in\nfavour of judicial decisions constituting sources of law. And the\nvalue of replicability also supports a doctrine of stare\ndecisis by which later courts are sometimes bound even by the\nerroneous decisions of earlier courts. This in turn leads to the need\nfor courts to have the power to overrule existing law, so that there\nis scope for incorrect decisions to be reversed.\n",
