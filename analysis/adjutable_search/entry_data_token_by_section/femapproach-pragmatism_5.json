    "main_text": "Pragmatist Feminist Philosophical Themes || Education\n3.3 Education\n\nPragmatist feminists of the Progressive Era had an enormous influence\non childhood and adult educational theory and practice. Addams\u2019\neducational philosophy provides a model for the interaction between\nthinking and action. For her, as well as for other educators like Lucy\nSprague Mitchell, education is not seen as standing apart from life\nbut rather blending seamlessly into the fabric of experiences and\nproviding a meaning-making function. Addams understood that while\neducation informs experience (providing historical context as well as\nskills), it must also interact with and change in response to current\nsocial needs. In understanding the culture that students come from as\nwell as the values of their lives, Addams argued for an educational\napproach that uses students\u2019 own experiences (personal as well\nas cultural) as starting points for learning.\n\nIn general, early pragmatist-feminist writing consistently\ndemonstrates a distrust of educational theories that are disconnected\nfrom experience. In Twenty Years at Hull House (1910), Addams\ntalks about how the professor\u2019s lack of interest in matters of\nthe \u201cwelfare of mankind\u201d leaves behind the messy and\nchaotic experiential realm of student relationships for the more pure\nintellectual realm; she argued this separation also opens students to\nthe influence of \u201ccharlatans\u201d (1910 [1990]: 247).\nAddams\u2019 vision of education, even in the early days of Hull\nHouse, fostered an interchange between the intellectual culture of a\nliberal arts education and the practical aspects of urban industrial\nlife, bringing life and thought together.\n\nAddams was involved in educational reform in the Chicago Public\nSchools and later was a member of the Chicago School Board. However,\nher philosophy of education has had more enduring impact on adult\neducation theory and practice, primarily as a result of her\ninnovations at Hull House. In working with adults, she integrated\narts, literature and history into industrial life; later she\ncelebrated the arts and culture that was already present in the lives\nof her industrial immigrant communities. In contrast, Lucy Sprague\nMitchell\u2019s Bank Street School demonstrated the effectiveness of\npragmatist child-centered education and continues to influence\nchildhood development specialists and educators.\n\nFurther, a host of feminist pragmatists had a direct and sustained\ninfluenced on Dewey\u2019s educational philosophy: from Jane Addams\nand Alice Chipman Dewey, to Ella Flagg Young, Elsie Ripley Clapp, and\nLucy Sprague Mitchell. Indeed, Dewey had not published in philosophy\nof education, or worked on educational issues, before he came to\nChicago where he experienced Jane Addams\u2019s Hull House and worked\nwith individuals like Ella Flagg Young. Her contributions to Dewey\u2019s\nphilosophy included: (1) \u201cthe extent to which freedom meant\n\u2026 a respect for the inquiring or reflective process of\nindividuals\u201d; (2) an understanding of \u201cthe way that the\ninteractions of persons with one another influences their mental\nhabits\u201d; and, (3) \u201chow all psychology that was not simply\nphysiological was social\u201d (Seigfried 1996: 80).\n Pragmatist philosophy of education continues to have a global influence. Dewey is\noften cited as the catalyst for experiential learning and civic\nengagement practices. For instance, David Kolb utilizes Dewey\u2019s\nphilosophy to advocate for a move away from narrowly framed and\nabstract specialization towards experiential learning (2003). Kolb,\nlike many others, extends this philosophy of education, emphasizing\nlearning as a spiral cycle of reflective action and engagement (Brown\nand Lambert 2013; Norton 2005).\n\nOther contemporary feminist philosophers of education draw on the\npragmatist tradition, especially the work of early pragmatist women,\nin their conceptualization of education as a political and\nemancipatory practice. Possibly because of its interest in the\nrelationship between theory and action, philosophy of education has\nalways occupied a privileged place in pragmatist philosophy, and\nfeminist pragmatist writing reflects this.\n\nFeminist philosophers, such as Elizabeth Minnich and Jane Roland\nMartin, have critiqued the traditional canon,\npointing out the ways that the canon perpetuates the traditional power\nstructures by excluding the works of women and minorities. Minnich\npoints out that the administrative structures of colleges and\nuniversities often place programs like women\u2019s studies or\nAfrican-American studies on the periphery of the college hierarchies.\nMinnich\u2019s 1990 book, Transforming Knowledge, draws on\nboth a feminist critique and pragmatist practices to advocate for a\nrethinking of the patriarchal assumptions at the base of our academic\ntraditions. This work reconstructs what it means to do philosophy,\nopening our definitions of philosophy to voices that may have been\npreviously excluded or marginalized. Minnich and other feminist\nthinkers show us how many traditional theorists have been blinded by\ntheir inability to conceive of ideas outside of the dominant hegemonic\ntraditions. Minnich points out that pragmatism can share with feminism\nthe vitality that arises from an opening of philosophy to newness, to\notherness, to diversity.\n\nMaxine Greene, a philosopher of education who draws on multiple\nphilosophical traditions, has inspired a generation of educators and\nphilosophers to think of education in terms of a practice of freedom,\nto provide an opening of spaces\nfor new ways of thinking and being.\nIn The Dialectic of Freedom (1988), Greene relies on John\nDewey, the example of Jane Addams, as well as feminist novels, to\ndescribe the ways that women have told the truths about their private\nand public lives. Greene wants an educational system that allows\nradical difference, that leaves open a space for diverse others to\nappear in the public world, to \u201ctear aside the conventional\nmasks\u2026that hide women\u2019s being in the world\u201d (1988:\n\n57).\n\nMore recent feminist pragmatist pedagogies integrate scholarship on\nwicked problems, sustainability education, and community engagement\n(Lake 2015; Whipps 2014a); Parker 2010). This educational approach\nextends the work of Dewey and Addams, highlighting the need for\n\u201ccontext-sensitive, dialogue-driven, action-based\u201d\nlearning (Lake 2015: 252). The integration and application of these\nfields offers students opportunities to impact real problems, develop\nskills, and foster virtues necessary for collaboratively addressing\npublic problems. Current research on this form of education highlights\nhow it prepares students to take on the role of an integrator and\n\u201cboundary spanner\u201d (Ramaley 2014: 12) in addition to\n\nfostering \u201cchange agent\u201d skills (Svanstr\u00f6m,\nLozano-Garc\u00eda, and Rowe 2008).\n",
