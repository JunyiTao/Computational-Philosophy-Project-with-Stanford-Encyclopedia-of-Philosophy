Furthermore, the notion of\na deity often plays a central role in these cosmological theories.\nAccording to most monotheistic religions, God is the sole creator and\nsustainer of the universe.\n\nBut the last one hundred years have seen a different sort of\ncosmology: a scientific cosmology. Without running afoul of the\ndemarcation problem, the notable characteristics of scientific\ncosmology are that it uses the tools of mathematical physics (it is\nformalizable) and that it makes precise and testable predictions. What\nhas this new scientific cosmology to do with traditional (often\ntheistic) cosmologies? Has the new cosmology replaced the older\ncosmologies? Does the new cosmology inform or interpret the older\ncosmologies?\n\nOur subsequent discussion will be restricted almost completely to the\ncase of western monotheism\u2014Judaism, Christianity, and\nIslam\u2014and even more specifically to variants of Christianity.\nEven so, we note a wide range of diversity among Christian beliefs and\nChristian attitudes towards science in general, and towards scientific\ncosmology in particular. At one extreme, we find ultra-traditional\nversions of Christianity that emphasize literal interpretation of\nScripture, and that often interpret theological doctrines in terms of\nancient Greek philosophical categories (e.g., God as eternal,\nunchangeable, etc.). Even within this more traditional camp, we find\ndifferences in terms of amount of literalism, and amount of\nflexibility with regard to traditional theological doctrines. (e.g.,\nthere are ongoing debates among traditional theologians about the\nrelation of God to time.) At another extreme, we find more recent\nincarnations of Christianity that draw heavily on ideas from German\nidealism and/or process philosophy. There are also subtle, but not\nnegligible, differences in attitude among Protestant, Roman Catholic,\nand Orthodox Christian theists. Thus, we should not think of theism as\none fixed set of doctrines that is simply consistent or inconsistent\nwith scientific cosmology.\n\nFurthermore, even though most theological interactions with cosmology\nhave taken place within the Christian tradition, it has\nrarely\u2014if ever\u2014been the case that the defining feature of\nChristianity (viz. the unique role of Christ) has played any explicit\nrole in these interactions.\n", "toc": [{"#1": "1.

Overview: Cosmology, theology and religion\n\nChristianity and other monotheistic religions (Islam and Judaism)\nassume a transcendent and sovereign God who created the universe and\ncontinually maintains its existence. The world only exists because of\nan ultimate and supernatural cause which is, as Newton said,\n\u201cnot blind and fortuitous, but very well skilled in Mechanicks\nand Geometry\u201d (Cohen 1978, 282). Whether in a general\nphilosophical sense or in a scientific sense, cosmology has always\nbeen part of theism, but it is only relatively recently that cosmology\nbased on physics and astronomy has entered the discussion concerning\nthe existence and role of God. A limited application of physics to the\nstudy of the universe can be found in the second half of the\nnineteenth century when the cosmological consequences of the law of\nentropy increase were eagerly discussed in relation to the Christian\ndoctrines of a world with a beginning and end in time. However,\nphysical cosmology is essentially a twentieth century science which\nemerged as a result of the discovery about 1930 that the universe is\nin a state of expansion that possibly started a finite time ago.\nCosmology as a subdiscipline of physics differs in some respects from\nmathematical, philosophical and classical observational cosmology, but\nof course the different approaches are in constant interaction. In a\nmodern sense, physical cosmology became established after the\ndiscovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1965 which quickly\nturned the hot big bang model into the standard model of the universe.\nJim Peebles\u2019 Physical Cosmology of 1971, possibly the\nfirst book with this title, may be taken as the beginning of modern\nphysical cosmology.\n\nAlthough physical cosmology based on general relativity theory and\nelementary particle physics is thus a modern science, many of the\ntheologically relevant questions related to current cosmology are old.\nDid the universe come into existence a finite time ago? Will it come\nto an end? Why are the cosmic evolution and the laws of nature of just\nsuch a kind that they permit intelligent life to exist? These and\nother questions of obvious relevance to theism are currently being\ndiscussed in the light of the most recent cosmological theories and\nobservations, but the questions themselves (and, indeed, many of the\nanswers) were familiar to medieval philosophers and theologians. This\nis also the case with the question that is sometimes considered the\nultimate one: Why is there a cosmos? There is no reason to expect that\ntoday\u2019s advanced physical cosmology, or the even more advanced\nof tomorrow, will provide final answers that satisfy theists and\natheists alike.\n2. Creation and the big bang\n\nEinstein\u2019s general theory of relativity shows that the structure\nof spacetime is itself a dynamical variable, subject to causal\ninfluence by the material constituents of the universe. Indeed,\nEinstein immediately saw the potential to apply general relativity to\nlarge-scale cosmological questions. The first cosmological model of\nEinstein (1917) described a static universe, i.e. one whose spatial\ngeometry is constant over time. However, Einstein\u2019s static\nuniverse was empirically inadequate: it could not account for the\nredshift data gathered by Edwin Hubble and others in the 1920s. The\nredshift data indicated that distant stars are moving away from us,\nand moving faster in direct proportion to their distance. Thus, the\ndata indicated an expanding universe.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, a number of cosmological models of general\nrelativity were proposed that predict the expansion of the universe.\nThe most accurate account of the data is given by the family of\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) models. The key characteristic of\nthese models is that space is homogeneous, and hence\nisotropic (i.e. looks the same in all directions). From the\nhomogeneity assumption, it follows that the entire 4-dimensional\nspacetime divides neatly into a stack of 3-dimensional\n\u201cspaces\u201d each of which has constant curvature. The three\npossibilities for this curvature correspond to the three classical\ngeometries: Euclidean (flat), spherical (positive), or hyperbolic\n(negative). In a given FRW spacetime, the geometry of space at one\ntime is related to the geometry at any other time by means of a scale\nfactor S(t). Indeed, pick a reference time T,\nsuch as 2021, pick two reference galaxies, and let d(T)\nbe the distance between these galaxies at time T. Then the\ndistance between the two galaxies at any other time t is given\nby d(t)=S(t)d(T), where we\nset S(T)=1. This number S(t) is called the\nscale factor, and its behavior encodes the dynamics of a FRW\nuniverse.\n\nIn those FRW spacetimes that can reasonably be thought to model our\ncosmos (e.g., those with massive objects), the time parameter t\nhas an absolute lower bound t0. In particular, as\nt decreases towards t0, the scale parameter\nS(t) goes to zero. What happens when t reaches\nt0? In short, these models cannot say what happens,\nbecause there are no points of spacetime with time coordinate\nt0. That is, t0 is an ideal point\nthat is never reached: the universe exists at all times after\nt0, but not before or at time t0.\nA spacetime model with this feature is called singular, and\nthe ideal point that is never reached is called a\nsingularity. In other words, the big bang is a singularity in\na FRW spacetime.\n\nThe FRW spacetimes are extremely accurate descriptions of the large\nscale structure of our universe. Since these models describe a\nuniverse with a finite lifetime, it is reasonable to conclude\nthat the universe has not always existed.\n\nBut many physicists and philosophers hesitate to draw this conclusion.\nIn fact, the standard view in the 1950s and early 1960s was that the\nsingularities of the FRW models were consequences of false idealizing\nassumptions, namely assumptions of perfect isotropy and homogeneity.\nBut this escape route from singularities was definitely closed when\nRobert Geroch, Stephen Hawking, and Roger Penrose proved the\n\u201csingularity theorems,\u201d according to which almost\nall spacetimes are singular, and in particular, almost all\ncosmological models describe a finitely old universe.\n\nA number of theists take the past-singular nature of cosmological\nmodels as confirmation of the claim that God created the universe\nex nihilo. The list of advocates of this \u201cbig bang\ntheology\u201d includes Pope Pius XII, Francis Collins (director, US\nNational Institutes of Health), and apologists William Lane Craig and\nHugh Ross. And indeed, big bang cosmology does provide prima\nfacie support for theism. After all, big bang cosmology says that\nthe universe has a finite age, and (traditional) theism says that God\ncreated the universe out of nothing. Does big bang cosmology not\nconfirm traditional theism? We give several reasons to be cautious\nabout such claims.\n\nAdvocates of big bang theology are most interested in the claim that\nthe universe is finitely old. Thus, the chain of inferential support\nshould run as follows:\n\nBig Bang Model \u2192 supports \u2192 Universe Finitely Old\n\u2192 supports \u2192 Theism\n\n\nBefore discussing the first supposed inferential relation, we note\nthat not all theists are committed to the claim that the universe is\nfinitely old. For example, Aquinas claims (in several places,\nincluding the Summa Theologica) that Reason cannot\ndemonstrate the finitude of the universe. But Aquinas also thinks that\nReason can demonstrate the existence of God; therefore Aquinas does\nnot think that the very concept of God as creator implies that the\nuniverse is finitely old. (Contrary to some contemporary theologians,\nAquinas claims that a Christian theist should believe that\nthe universe is finitely old. For Aquinas, the finite age of the\nuniverse is a revealed doctrine, like the divinity of Christ.)\n\nContemporary theologians Arthur Peacocke and Ian Barbour also claim\nthat the doctrine of the \u201ccreation\u201d of the universe is\nbest interpreted as one of the universe\u2019s timeless dependence on\nGod, and that such dependence does not demand a temporal creation\nevent. This is also the view of William Stoeger (2010), a Jesuit\npriest and cosmologist, who argues that scientific cosmology can\npurify theology but never be in conflict with what theology\nlegitimately asserts. For the remainder of this article, we will not\ndiscuss further the question of whether theism requires, or strongly\nsupports, the claim that the universe is finitely old. (Arguments for\nthis claim are assessed in (Copan & Craig 2004).) For now we focus\non versions of theism that are committed\u2014in a perhaps naive\nway\u2014to creation ex nihilo. Even on this understanding\nof theism, there are still reasons to exercise caution in seeing the\nbig bang as confirming the prediction that God created the\nuniverse.\n2.1 Whose theism is the big bang supposed to confirm?\n\nThe big-bang theologian argues that the claim\n\n\u201cThe universe is 13 billion years old\u201d\n\n\nprovides evidential support for theism. But there are many theists for\nwhom the discovery that the universe is 13 billion years old would\nactually serve as a disconfirmation of their theistic belief. For\nexample, Bishop Ussher of Ireland (1581\u20131656) claimed to derive\nfrom the Bible that the universe was created in 4004 B.C.; and even in\nthe twenty-first century, some Christian thinkers claim Biblical\nwarrant for an age of the universe much less than 13 billion years\n(see Kelly 2000 and Byl 2001). For these thinkers, then, the big bang\nwould disconfirm theism\u2014or at least their version of theism,\nwhich is committed to the literal accuracy of the Biblical account of\ncreation. More strongly, it seems that Christian theism is committed\nto a belief in a finitely old universe primarily on the basis of its\ncommitment to the accuracy of Biblical accounts of creation. Thus, if\na theist comes to believe the big-bang account of the universe\u2019s\norigin, and hence to doubt the literal Biblical account, then she will\nlose one reason\u2014and possibly her only reason\u2014for believing\nthat the universe is finitely old.\n\nOf course, there are also theists who interpret Genesis metaphorically\nas implying that the universe was created, but not indicating a\nspecific age for the universe. For these theists, finding that the\nuniverse is finitely old might confirm rather than undermine their\nbelief.\n2.2 Should the theist look for confirmation from scientific cosmology?\n\nAccording to traditional Christian theism, creation ex nihilo\nis miraculous\u2014something which the laws of nature cannot explain.\nBut then why should a theist expect to be able to derive creation\nex nihilo from the laws of nature? Compare with other\nsupposed miracles, e.g., within Christianity the claim that Jesus\nchanged water into wine. Do Christian theists claim that chemistry\nshould predict that water can transform into wine? Of course not: God\nis supposed to be able to transcend the laws of nature, and the laws\nof nature are defeasible when it comes to describing what actually did\nhappen (since God could have intervened). But then couldn\u2019t the\nbest (most explanatory, most elegant) cosmological theory posit an\ninfinite past, whereas in reality God created it some finite time in\nthe past?\n\nThe puzzle we have just encountered trades on the special status of\ncosmology as a historical, yet law-based science, with only one actual\nmodel. While theists would certainly not expect the laws of chemistry\nto predict that water can transform into wine, they do believe that an\naccurate historical account would include reference to those miracles\nthat did occur. So, is cosmology more like history, or more like\nchemistry? If God did create the universe, should a cosmological\ntheory report (or predict or entail) such a fact? Or should cosmology\nonly be required to provide laws for universes, laws which might in\nfact have been broken in our universe?\n2.3 Which cosmological models support a doctrine of creation ex nihilo?\n\nSuppose that the theist takes a harder line and says that theism\nrequires (or favors) cosmological models with a finitely old universe.\nIn this case, the time parameter in our cosmological models should\nnever take values lower than some fixed number, which we can\nconveniently set to zero.\n\nBut the interval (0,t) is topologically isomorphic to\n(\u2212\u221e,t), suggesting that duration of time (finite\nversus infinite) might lack intrinsic physical or theological\nsignificance. Such a point was made already by E.A. Milne in 1935, and\nthen independently by Charles Misner in 1969. In particular, Misner\nreplaces the time parameter t with the negative of its\nlogarithm (i.e., \u2212log t) in order to assuage worries that\na bounded time parameter makes no sense. According to Misner (1969,\n1331), even in models that begin with singularities, \u201cthe\nUniverse is meaningfully infinitely old because infinitely many things\nhave happened since the beginning.\u201d Interestingly,\nMisner\u2019s move can hardly be motivated by a desire to obviate the\nneed for a creator: Misner is a self-described Catholic Christian.\n\nThe possibility that the finite/infinite time distinction is\nconventional was noted by the Catholic philosopher of science Ernan\nMcMullin, who concludes that the theological doctrine of creation ex\nnihilo must not be given a metric interpretation (McMullin 1981).\nRather, claims McMullin, the ex nihilo doctrine should be\ninterpreted order-theoretically: the time series has a first point.\nBut this order-theoretic criterion will not help theism, at least not\nin regard to current cosmological models. On the one hand, FRW\ncosmological models fail the order-theoretic criterion: they\nhave no first moment of time. On the other hand, an ideal first moment\nof time could be adjoined to any spacetime, even those that\nhave a metrically infinite past (see Earman 1995). Thus, a simple\norder-theoretic criterion is a bad guide to whether cosmological\nmodels are consistent with the doctrine of creation ex\nnihilo.\n\nA more adequate criterion of when a cosmological model is consonant\nwith creation ex nihilo would require a detailed analysis of\nsingular spacetimes (for extensive discussion of the latter topic, see\nEarman 1995). The best current account of when a spacetime is truly\nsingular (as opposed to merely being described with inadequate\ncoordinates) is when it contains inextendible geodesics of finite\nlength. Intuitively, a geodesic is the path that would be followed by\na clock in freefall. If a clock were travelling on a past-inextendible\ngeodesic, then at some finite time in the past, the clock did not\nexist; more strongly, spacetime itself did not exist. Thus, the\nbig-bang theologian would do best to claim that creation ex\nnihilo is confirmed precisely by those cosmological spacetimes\nthat have inextendible geodesics. (Indeed, this criterion does hold\nfor FRW models.) The main problem with such a proposal is that it ties\na robust, intuitive theological doctrine down to an extremely precise\ntechnical feature of Lorentzian manifolds (as described by\ndifferential geometry). The risk then is that by doing so, one would\nadd extraneous content to the theological doctrine: a future model\nmight fail the technical criterion while still being consistent with\nthe theological doctrine. Furthermore, many Christian theists claim\nthat core theological doctrines are perspicuous\u2014in particularly,\nnot understood exclusively by an elite class of priests or scholars.\nBut the notion of a Lorentzian manifold having incomplete geodesics\ncan hardly be said to be accessible to the average layperson.\n2.4 Can we trust General Relativity?\n\nFinally, big-bang theology overreaches if it says that general\nrelativity and the singularity theorems have settled once and for all\nthat the universe had a beginning in time. In fact, relativistic\ncosmology predicts its own invalidity for times close to a dynamic\nsingularity, such as the big bang. (For a dissenting opinion, see\nMisner 1969.) The reason that relativistic cosmology predicts its own\nown invalidity is that in the neighborhood of singularities,\ngravitational effects are intense, and quantum effects can be expected\nto play a predominant role. But general relativity does not\nincorporate quantum effects, and indeed it is untested in such regimes\nof intense gravitational force. Thus, there is little reason to\nbelieve that the singularity theorems make a valid prediction about\nthe structure of a future successor theory of general relativity that\nincludes quantum effects. We discuss this issue further in Section\n4.\n2.5 Does the big bang provide evidence for atheism?\n\nMost philosophers and physicists have thought that big bang cosmology\nis either neutral towards, or supportive of, traditional theism. Thus,\natheists have usually taken a defensive stance, trying to defeat the\narguments of the big-bang theologians. But a vocal minority\u2014we\nmight call them \u201cbig-bang atheologians\u201d\u2014have made\nthe stronger claim that big bang cosmology disconfirms theism. The\nmost visible proponents of this big-bang atheology are the\nphilosophers Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum and Quentin Smith. In the case of\nSmith, quantum cosmologies are taken to provide even stronger evidence\nagainst theism.\n\nIn putting forward their arguments, big-bang atheologians make a\nnumber of points that seem to have been overlooked by their theistic\ncounterparts. One such point is that FRW cosmological models have no\nfirst state. Thus, a theist who invokes the big bang cannot say that\nthere is a state of the universe, say \u0391, such that God created\nthe universe in state \u0391. He or she will have to invoke a more\nsophisticated notion of God creating initial temporal intervals, or\nsomething like that. Are these more sophisticated developments still\nconsonant with traditional theology?\n\nBig-bang atheologians also argue that it makes no sense to accept both\nthat there were no times before the big bang (since time itself comes\ninto existence with the universe) and that the universe was caused. Of\ncourse, many theists claim that God causes the universe timelessly,\nand they would attempt to defend the coherence of such a notion in the\nface of these criticisms.\n\nThe case of quantum cosmology provides further complications for\ntheology. Without going into excessive detail of specific proposals, a\ncommon theme of many quantum cosmologies is that they postulate a\nprobability distribution over universes themselves. In other words,\nquantum cosmologies provide a measure of likelihood that certain sorts\nof universes exist. Some older quantum cosmologies (e.g.,\nHawking\u2019s early proposals) still predict that the universe is\nfinitely old. And yet, one might consider their further explanatory\npower\u2014over and above classical general relativity\u2014as\nundermining theistic explanations of the universe. In particular,\nquantum cosmology predicts with a high probability that a universe\nlike ours would exist. Seen from this perspective, one might take\nquantum cosmologies to offer a competing, non-theistic explanation for\nthe origin of the universe.\n\nTheists have argued, in response, that quantum cosmologies do not\nprovide unconditional probabilities for the existence of the\nuniverse. For example, Craig (1997), Deltete & Guy (1997), and\nOppy (1997) argue that quantum cosmologies provide only conditional\nprobabilities for the existence of some universe configurations given\nother universe configurations. Smith (1998) responds by defending the\nclaim that the probabilities in quantum cosmology are unconditional.\nBut neither side of this debate has attended to the special\ncomplications involved in interpreting quantum, rather than\nclassical, probabilities. For example, Smith treats the universal\nwavefunction\n\u03a8(hi\u2009j,\u2009f) as\nproviding a probability distribution over universe configurations\n(hi\u2009j,\u2009f). But we know,\nfrom elementary quantum mechanics, that it is literally inconsistent\n(i.e., leads to contradictions) to treat a wavefunction as giving\nprobabilities in an absolute sense. (This contradiction is derived by\nthe famous Kochen-Specker theorem.) We conclude that in order for the\nmetaphysical significance of quantum cosmologies to be assessed, a\nmore nuanced consideration of the interpretation of quantum mechanics\nwill be required.\n3. Steady-state theories\n\nAristotle\u2019s cosmology belonged to the class of steady-state\ntheories in so far that his universe was changeless and eternal. When\nEinstein in 1917 proposed the first relativistic model of the\nuniverse, he unwittingly pictured a universe which had qualitative\nfeatures in common with Aristotle\u2019s: it was finite in space, but\ninfinite in time. The discovery of the expansion of the universe\nexcluded the steady state from relativistic cosmology, but not from\nother forms of cosmology. Robert Millikan, Nobel laureate and famous\nphysicist, was among those who in the 1930s favored an eternally\nrecurrent universe with a continual creation of matter and energy to\ncounter the increase of entropy. He thought that such an eternal and\nevolving universe revealed the creator\u2019s continual activity and\nexplicitly presented his cosmological view as support for the\ndoctrines of Christianity in general and for the immanence of God in\nparticular.\n\nContrary to the earlier ideas of a steady-state universe, the theory\nthat Fred Hoyle, Hermann Bondi and Thomas Gold introduced in 1948\naccepted that the universe is expanding. Conceptually the theory was\nfounded on the \u201cperfect cosmological principle,\u201d that is,\nthe postulate that the universe in its large-scale features is not\nonly spatially but also temporally homogeneous. Although this\nclassical steady-state theory was abandoned in the 1960s because of\nits inability to account for new discoveries (such as the cosmic\nmicrowave background and the redshifts of quasars), it remains an\ninstructive case in the cosmology-theology discussion. Moreover, the\ntheory is not quite dead yet, as some of its characteristic features\nsurvive in the quasi-steady-state cosmology (QSSC) still defended by\nJayant Narlikar and a few other cosmologists. This model does not\nsatisfy the perfect cosmological principle, but it assumes an\nindefinite cosmic time scale during which matter is continually\ncreated. In this respect it is an alternative to the big-bang theory\nand its supposed association with divine creation. In 1994, at a time\nwhen he was developing the QSSC model, Hoyle referred to big-bang\ncosmology as \u201ca form of religious fundamentalism\u201d (Hoyle\n1994, 413). According to the classical steady-state theory, the\nuniverse has expanded for an infinity of time and will continue to do\nso for ever; yet the average density of matter remains constant\nbecause matter, or rather matter-energy, is continually being created\nout of nothing. (In later versions of the theory, matter creation was\nnot ex nihilo.) Both features\u2014the infinite time scale\nand the continuous creation of matter\u2014were controversial and\ncaused concern of a philosophical and also a theological nature.\n\nIt was widely assumed in the 1950s that the steady-state universe was\ncontrary to theism or at least made God superfluous as a creator of\nthe cosmos. After all, how can God have created a universe which has\nexisted in an infinity of time? According to the astronomer, science\npopularizer and non-believer Carl Sagan, \u201cthis is one\nconceivable finding of science that could disprove a\nCreator\u2014because an infinitely old universe would never have been\ncreated\u201d (1997, 265). However, although the argument may seem to\npose a real problem for theism, the theologians were well\nprepared\u2014it had been discussed since the thirteenth century when\nThomas Aquinas suggested that God could indeed have created an\ninfinitely old universe. Moreover, theological responses to an\ninfinitely old universe were far from new, for they had already been\ndeveloped in relation to eternally cyclic models, either in the more\nspeculative versions of the nineteenth century or the relativistic\nmodels that were proposed in the 1930s onwards.\n\nAccording to the Thomistic doctrine of creatio continuans,\nGod causes things to exist in the sense that their existence depends\nwholly on his power. If they were left to themselves they would turn\ninto, or return into, nothingness. From this point of view creation is\nbasically a metaphysical rather than a physical and temporal concept,\nand an eternal yet created universe is perfectly possible.\nInterestingly, the leading steady-state physicist William McCrea was\nalso a devout Christian who argued that cosmology, in whatever form,\nmust necessarily include the postulation of a divine creator. As\ntheologians in the 1950s, both Protestants and Catholics, were quick\nto point out, Hoyle\u2019s eternal universe was not particularly\nheretical, for it was still in need of a creator. Not only did they\nmobilize the old concept of continual divine creation, emphasizing\nthat cosmic creation is primarily about the ontological dependence of\nthe world on God, they also stressed that faith in God has little to\ndo with physical cosmology in whatever of its versions. Erich Mascall,\na priest and philosopher of religion, saw no reason why the\nsteady-state model should cause worry among the faithful. As he said\nin 1956, \u201cThe whole question whether the world had a beginning\nor not is, in the last resort, profoundly unimportant for\ntheology\u201d (Mascall 1956, 155).\n\nViews similar to Mascall\u2019s have been held by many later\ntheologians and Christian philosophers, but not by all. There is\ndisagreement about how solidly based in the Bible the concept of\natemporal continual creation is, and also about the significance of an\nabsolute beginning of the world (for opposite views, see Copan and\nCraig 2004 and May 1994). The view that cosmology is essentially\nirrelevant to Christian belief has not gone uncontested. As Ernan\nMcMullin has pointed out, Christian doctrines are more than\nmetaphysics and codes for moral conduct; they are also cosmic claims\nthat say something about the universe and what it contains of things.\nFor this reason theologians need to pay attention to cosmology in\nparticular and to science in general.\n\nSome Christian scientists and philosophers have seen the continual\ncreation of matter, as posited by the steady-state theory, as a\nmanifestation of perpetual divine creation. Thus, the Catholic\nphilosopher Philip Quinn (1993) adopted the old notion of creatio\ncontinuans to the case of steady-state cosmology. The argument is\nessentially that since ex nihilo creation of matter violates\nenergy conservation, there must be an external creative cause that\naccounts for the violation, and this cause he identifies with\nperpetual divine creation. This kind of reasoning has been severely\ncriticized by Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum, who flatly dismisses the claim that\nunderlies the idea of perpetual divine creation, namely that\nnothingness is the natural state of the universe. This claim has also\nbeen argued in detail by Richard Swinburne (1996), who finds it\nextraordinary that there exists anything at all and from the fact that\nsomething exists infers the existence of God. But according to\nGr\u00fcnbaum there is no room for divine creation in either big-bang\nor steady-state cosmology. \u201cSteady-state cosmology,\u201d he\nconcludes, \u201cis indeed logically incompatible with [the]\nclaim that divine creative intervention is causally necessary for the\nnonconservative popping into existence of new matter in the\nsteady-state universe\u201d (Gr\u00fcnbaum 1996, 529).\n\nWhereas steady-state cosmology is at least problematical from the\npoint of view of traditional theology, it goes well together with the\nideas of process theology or philosophy, where God is seen as\ninteracting creatively and incessantly with natural processes. In a\ngeneral sense, Whitehead\u2019s philosophy is more in harmony with\nthe steady state than the big bang universe. The prominent British\nastronomer Bernard Lovell (1959), a devoted Christian inspired by\nprocess thinking, was in sympathy with the steady-state theory and saw\nno reason why it should be a threat to belief in a divine being. To\nhim, the creation of matter was a sure sign of God\u2019s\nactivity.\n4. Quantum and string cosmologies\n\nAs we mentioned previously, there are reasons to suspect the\ninvalidity of classical general relativity in regions near a\nsingularity\u2014most importantly, for times very close to the big\nbang. In particular, when lengths are very small, and curvature and\ntemperatures are very high, then\u2014if the gravitational force\nbehaves like all other known forces of nature\u2014quantum effects\nwill take over, and we should accordingly expect different outcomes.\nThis observation is itself sufficient to destroy the aspirations of\nbig-bang theology\u2014unless there are good reasons to think that\nthe finite-age prediction of relativistic cosmology will be preserved\nin a quantum gravity or in string theory. In this section, we briefly\nreview the known data about singularities in theories that attempt to\nunify gravity and quantum mechanics. Our review supports two\nconclusions: (1) We do not know yet if the best model will predict a\nfinitely old universe, but (2) there are good reasons to think that\nthe big bang is not necessarily an absolute beginning.\n\nThere have been a number of proposed theories of quantum cosmology.\nPerhaps best known of these is the proposal of Stephen Hawking, which\nresults in a universe with no boundary\u2014motivating the famous\nquestion, \u201cwhat place, then, for a creator?\u201d The bearing\nof Hawking\u2019s cosmology on theism has already been discussed\nextensively by Craig & Smith (1995), Deltete & Guy (1997),\nCraig (1997), and Smith (1998). But it would be ill advised to take\nHawking\u2019s theory as giving the final version of quantum\ncosmology. As noted by Drees (1990), Hawking\u2019s approach is just\none among several competing attempts to incorporate quantum effects\ninto relativistic cosmology, and we are not compelled to accept its\nidiosyncratic metaphysical picture. More to the point, Hawking\u2019s\ncosmological model is ad hoc in the sense that it does not\nflow from a more comprehensive unification of general relativity\nquantum theory. In this section we turn to two cosmological theories\nthat do result from systematic and comprehensive unifications of\ngeneral relativity and quantum theory: loop quantum cosmology and\nstring cosmology.\n\nLoop quantum cosmology (LQC) is an approach to cosmology within the\nframework of the loop quantum gravity (LQG) program (Rovelli 2004),\nwhich itself starts with the idea that unifying quantum theory and\ngeneral relativity will require \u201cquantizing\u201d the\ngravitational field\u2014and hence the structures of spacetime\nitself. Roughly speaking, to quantize a theory means that the\nquantities (e.g., position, momentum, scalar curvature, etc.) are\nreplaced by \u201cmatrices,\u201d or more generally with\n\u201coperators on a Hilbert space.\u201d This replacement can have\nprofound physical consequences, most particularly the spectrum of a\nquantity (i.e., the numerical values it can possess) can become\ndiscretized where it was previously continuous, or bounded where it\nwas previously unbounded, and quantities can be forced to obey a\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle.\n\nFor our purposes, the important question is what happens to those\nquantities (e.g., spatial curvature) that grow unboundedly large in\nclassical FRW spacetimes as the time parameter t approaches the\ninitial boundary time t0? To answer this question\nrequires going through intricate technicalities involving domains of\ndefinition of operators, etc.. To summarize, however, the most\nprominent proposal (championed primarily by Martin Bojowald and\ncollaborators; see Bojowald 2009) results in a scale parameter\nS(t) that is bounded away from zero, entailing that\ncurvature is bounded from above. More is true: the dynamical equations\nof LQC extend through the big bang, i.e., the universe existed\nbefore the big bang.\n\nIt would be premature to take loop quantum cosmology as having\ndecisively overturned the big-bang, finite-age cosmological model.\nNonetheless, there is a non-negligible probability that it will do so\nin the near future; and hence there is a non-negligible probability\nthat the big bang is not the beginning of the universe, and a\nfortiori, not the creation event (even if there was one).\n\nHowever, loop quantum gravity is not the most popular\u2014in terms\nof sheer number of researchers\u2014approach to unifying quantum\ntheory and gravity. The title of most popular belongs to string\ntheory, and so string theory\u2019s perspective on the big bang event\nis of crucial interest for those wishing to assess the bearing of\nphysical cosmology on traditional theological doctrines.\n\nAll indications from string cosmology point to the fact that the\nuniverse existed before the big bang. In particular, string theory\nclaims that if we apply fundamental symmetry transformations to\ncosmological models of the recent universe, then we get a copy of the\nuniverse (with important quantities inverted) that might be called the\n\u201cpre-big-bang universe.\u201d In this scenario, the absolute\nbig bang disappears and is replaced by a saddle point in the dynamical\nevolution of spacetime curvature: before this point, curvature is\nincreasing, and after this point, it is decreasing.\n\nAccording to Gasperini (2008), string cosmology\u2019s prediction of\na pre-big-bang universe results from a principled application of\nsymmetry principles. Furthermore, string theory has a built in\nmechanism (namely a minimum string length) that seems to rule out\nsingularities of infinite curvature or spatial length shrinking to\nzero. As was the case in LQC, the values of physical quantities in\nstring theory are constrained by quantum mechanical laws; and so some\nquantities that grew beyond bounds in classical theory are\nwell-behaved in quantized versions of that theory.\n\nWe currently lack the empirical data that would distinguish between\ncompeting models of quantum cosmology. But these models make different\nempirical predictions from each other, and they also make different\npredictions from classical relativistic cosmology. Hence, it is an\nempirical, rather than a metaphysical, question whether the big bang\nwas the beginning of the universe.\n\nHowever, just as the big-bang is not unambiguously friendly to theism,\nso quantum cosmology is not unambiguously hostile to theism. Indeed,\nChris Isham (1993, 405) has suggested that quantum cosmology\u2019s\ndescription of a boundary-free universe accords quite well with\ntheism\u2019s insistence that God sustains the universe at all times.\n(See also the discussion in Drees 1988, 1990, 1991.) Clearly, theism\nhas shown some flexibility in integrating its doctrines with\nprevailing scientific worldviews\u2014as evidenced, e.g., in the\nintegration of Aristotelian cosmology, and in the exploitation of\nbig-bang cosmology. Should we expect the situation to be any different\nwith quantum cosmology?\n5. Other non-standard cosmologies\n\nApart from the quantum-based cosmologies mentioned above, there are\nseveral other theories of the universe that differ from the generally\naccepted big bang theory and are, in this sense,\n\u201cnon-standard.\u201d A few of these models have been discussed\nwithin a religious context. We shall limit ourselves to two groups of\ntheories, cyclic cosmologies and multiverse theories.\n5.1 Cyclic cosmologies\n\nOrigen, a third-century Christian philosopher, speculated that God,\nbefore he created our universe, had busied himself with the creation\nof an endless series of earlier worlds. His idea of an eternal cyclic\nuniverse was however condemned by the church and has since then\ngenerally been regarded as associated with atheism and materialism.\nIndeed, from about 1850 to 1920 the classical cyclic or recurrent\nuniverse was popular among many atheistic thinkers who found it to be\nincompatible with Christian doctrines. Nonetheless, some theists have\nendorsed such a universe, e.g., Joseph Smith\u2019s claim that\n\u201cas one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so\nshall another come\u201d (Mormon Book of Moses 1:38).\n\nAlthough Einstein\u2019s cosmological field equations do not justify\na series of pulsating universes, many cosmologists have suggested ways\nin which a collapsing universe can reappear from a nonsingular state\nand thus give birth to a new universe, perhaps ad infinitum. It should\nbe pointed out that Lema\u00eetre, the cosmologist-priest, did\nnot suggest such a \u201cPhoenix universe,\u201d in spite\nof numerous claims to the opposite. In some cases atheism has been\npart of the motivation for proposing singularity-free models with an\nunlimited past and future. For example, the British physicist William\nBonnor considered the new big bang theory \u201cthe opportunity\nChristian theology has been waiting for ever since science began to\ndepose religion from the minds of rational men\u201d (Bonnor 1964,\n117). His own favored candidate, a universe oscillating smoothly and\neternally between two states of finitely high density, avoided a\ndivine miracle and theistic exploitation of cosmology, in which\nrespect it was similar to the steady-state theory. Steven Weinberg\nnoticed the similarity: \u201cSome cosmologists are philosophically\nattracted to the oscillating model, especially because, like the\nsteady-state model, it nicely avoids the problem of Genesis\u201d\n(Weinberg 1977, 154).\n\nClassical-relativistic cyclic models presupposed a closed universe\ndisagreeing with current observations, for which reason they are no\nlonger considered viable alternatives. But the twenty-first century\nhas witnessed several new proposals, of which we shall mention only\ntwo: the \u201cconformal cyclic cosmology\u201d developed by Roger\nPenrose, and the \u201cnew cyclic cosmology\u201d developed by Paul\nSteinhardt and Neil Turok.\n\nIn his theory of conformal cyclic cosmology, Penrose claims that as\nthe big bang is approached, massive objects play a negligible role, so\nthat the physics is governed by degrees of freedom that are invariant\nunder rescaling of lengths and times. Such degrees of freedom are\ncalled \u201cconformal invariants.\u201d Thus, Penrose claims, we\nmake a mistake to model the early universe by a Lorentzian manifold\nwith a metric (as is done in classical general relativity). Rather,\nspacetime should be described by a conformal manifold, which\nis essentially a conformal equivalence class of general relativistic\nspacetimes. The \u201ccyclic\u201d part of Penrose\u2019s cosmology\ncomes from noticing that the future of one ever-expanding universe can\nbe smoothly bridged to the past of another big-bang universe by means\nof such a conformal manifold. In this case, the big bang is not a true\nbeginning, but only a sort of phase change from one\n\u201cepoch\u201d to another (Penrose 2010).\n\nThe new cyclic cosmology of Steinhardt and Turok develops ideas from\nstring theory to describe a universe without inflation going through\nan endless sequence of cycles\u2014in which case, the big bang is not\nthe beginning of time (Steinhardt and Turok 2007). In this respect the\nmodel is similar to the steady-state model, and Steinhardt and Turok\nhave indeed described it as a \u201cremarkable reincarnation\u201d\nof Hoyle\u2019s old theory. Although the new cyclic model has\nattracted a fair amount of attention, it is not widely accepted. Nor\nis this the case with the pre-big-bang bouncing cosmology advanced by\nGabriele Veneziano and Maurizio Gasperini on the basis of string\ntheory. According to the pre-big-bang model the universe is not only\neternal into the future, it is also eternal into the past, the two\ncosmic phases (contracting and expanding) being separated by a\nnon-singular big bang.\n\nEternal bouncing models qualitatively similar to the pre-big-bang\nscenario have been proposed earlier, either on the basis of the\nrelativistic field equations or on the idea of a plasma universe.\nAccording to the Swedish physicist Hannes Alfv\u00e9n, a Nobel\nlaureate of 1970 who developed the latter idea, the plasma universe\nwas an alternative to the theistic big bang theory. Since none of the\nmodels considered in this section operate with an absolute beginning,\nthey may seem to be problematic from a theistic point of view.\nHowever, the theist can always appeal to perpetual divine creation,\njust as in the case of the steady-state universe.\n5.2 The multiverse\n\nThe modern idea of the multiverse is theologically more controversial.\nIn its so-called landscape version, which since 2002 has been promoted\nand developed by Leonard Susskind and many other physicists, it is\nbased on the apparent non-uniqueness of the equations of string\ntheory. The solutions of the equations describe, in a sense, possible\nworlds with different physical parameters, interactions, types of\nparticles, and even dimensionality; the multitude of solutions are\nthen identified with really existing worlds which generally are\ncausally separate from ours. As a mechanism for generating the huge\nnumber of universes, multiverse physicists make use of the eternal\ninflation scenario. Moreover, the multiverse is closely associated\nwith anthropic reasoning: we find ourselves in our universe, with its\nparticular physical laws and content of particles, not because other\nuniverses are impossible or improbable, but because our kind of life\ncannot exist in other universes. The theory of the multiverse has\nseductively great explanatory power (while it has almost no predictive\npower), which is a major reason why many physicists and cosmologists\nfind it attractive. On the other hand, other physicists dismiss it as\npseudoscience because it is practically untestable.\n\nIt is common among supporters of the multiverse to conceive it as an\nalternative to a divinely created world and ideas of natural theology.\nBecause it represents our universe as a chance universe, special only\nby the fact that we live in it, the multiverse has been likened to\nanother and more famous anti-design theory, neo-Darwinianism. Weinberg\nputs it as follows: \u201cJust as Darwin and Wallace explained how\nthe wonderful adaption of living forms could arise without\nsupernatural intervention, so the string landscape may explain how the\nconstants of nature that we observe can take values suitable for life\nwithout being fine-tuned by a benevolent creator\u201d (Weinberg\n2007, 39). At least to some theists, the multiverse stands in sharp\ncontrast to Christian belief. As Richard Swinburne sees it, \u201cTo\npostulate a trillion trillion other universes, rather than one God in\norder to explain the orderliness of our universe, seems the height of\nirrationality\u201d (Swinburne 1996, 68).\n\nSwinburne joins several other philosophers and physicists in seeing\nphysical cosmology as providing key data for a new design argument.\nThe strength of such\n fine-tuning\n arguments continues to be a hotly contested issue among philosophers\n(see Collins 2009, Colyvan et al. 2005, McGrew et al. 2001, White\n2000).\n\nOn the other hand, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the\nmultiverse and belief in a divine creator. Several philosophers have\nargued that if theism is true, we should expect the actual world to be\na multiverse: being a perfect being, God would create a multiverse\nrather than just a single universe (Kraay 2010). It is possible to\nanswer affirmatively to the question, \u201cdoes God love the\nmultiverse?\u201d, such as the physicist Don Page did at a symposium\nin 2008 (see Page 2008). Even if there are 10500\nuniverses (but not, perhaps, if\nthere are an infinite number of them), they could have been\nprovidentially created by the almighty God with a purpose we cannot\nfathom. Why not? It has even been suggested (by Paul Davies) that\nmultiverse explanations are reminiscent of divine explanations and\nunintentionally reintroduce a transcendent creator.\n\nMormon theology differs in several respects drastically from the\ntheology of traditional Christianity. Not only is God personal and\nheld to have been created by a prior god (who was again created by a\nprior god, etc.), according to the central doctrine of \u201ceternal\nprogression\u201d human beings will ultimately become like God\nhimself. There is an infinite number of beings and it takes an\neternity for them to become gods. Standard big bang cosmology, based\nas it is on a universe of finite age, is incompatible with Mormonism,\nwhere existence has neither beginning nor end. Whereas traditional\ntheologians have no problem with a universe created ex\nnihilo, and many subscribe to this doctrine, Mormons flatly\nreject it. In order to overcome the conflict with physical cosmology,\nsome Mormon thinkers have turned to the multiverse. Realizing that the\nattempt to harmonize the Mormon dogma of eternal progression with\nmodern cosmology is problematic, Kirk Hagen says: \u201cFor\nMormonism, a compelling reason to consider a multiverse cosmology is\nto attempt a reconciliation of modern cosmological ideas and the\ncentral tenet of Mormon doctrine\u201d (Hagen 2006, 28).\n\nThe anthropic principle, an integral part of multiverse cosmology, has\nsimilarly been discussed in theological contexts and, again similarly,\nwithout any consensus emerging from the many discussions. In its most\ncommon version, called the weak anthropic principle, it states that\nwhat we observe is selected by our existence in a universe with just\nsuch properties that allow us to exist. Swinburne and some other\ntheists in favor of design arguments find the anthropic principle to\nbe, at best, unnecessary and obfuscating. To them, the values of the\ncosmic parameters and constants of nature appear to be fine-tuned\nbecause they are fine-tuned, the designer being God. The atheist\nRichard Dawkins goes further, arguing that the anthropic principle is\nan alternative to the design hypothesis and provides strong evidence\nfor a world without God. However, theists do not generally see\nanthropically based arguments as a problem for a divinely created\nworld. William Lane Craig and John Polkinghorne are among those who\nhold that the anthropic principle is compatible with divine design and\ncan even be seen as indirect support for theism. According to the\nSouth-African cosmologist (and Quaker) George Ellis, anthropic\nfine-tuning is the result of a purposeful design of the universe. He\nhas suggested a \u201cChristian anthropic principle\u201d as the\nbasis for an ultimate understanding of the universe that combines\nscientific and religious perspectives (Ellis 1993).\n\nIn relation to the design argument, as reinvigorated by the\ndiscussions of the anthropic principle, some physicists and\nphilosophers have returned to an old objection to it, namely that it\nis not an argument for the Christian God; it is at best an\nargument for a cosmic architect in a deistic sense, or for that matter\nseveral such architects. On the other hand, theists have replied that\neven if this objection be true it does not constitute a proof that the\nGod of theism does not exist. Although design arguments frequently\noccur in connection with the anthropic principle, it needs to be said\nthat they were not part of the original anthropic program initiated by\nBrandon Carter in 1974.\n6. Infinity and the universe\n\nCosmological theory has gone through many phases and proposals over\nthe past 100 years. Some have included universes with infinite pasts\nand these were mentioned previously. However, for the past forty years\nthere has been a strong consensus on the modern big bang theory which\nhas a finite past. But even if the universe is temporally finite in\nthe past, it may well be spatially and materially infinite. If space\nis infinite and the cosmological principle is assumed to be valid, the\nuniverse will contain an infinite number of galaxies, stars, atoms and\neverything else. Such actual infinities not only cause philosophical\nand logical problems, they may also cause problems of a theological\nnature. In his thought experiment known as \u201cHilbert\u2019s\nhotel\u201d the famous mathematician David Hilbert argued that\n(countable) actual infinities are so bizarre that they cannot have\nanything to do with the real world we live in. In this thought\nexperiment, Hilbert imagines that he arrives at a hotel with an\ninfinite number of rooms, all of which are occupied. The desk clerk\nclaims nonetheless that there is a vacancy. He then proceeds to ask\neach guest to move to the room with the next highest number in the\nsequence (see Oppy 2006, 8; Kragh 2014, Other Internet Resources).\n\nHilbert himself was uninterested in religion, but later philosophers\nand theologians have occasionally used his peculiar hotel\napologetically, as an argument for the existence of God and also for\nthe finitude of the universe.\n\nThe theological problems related to an infinitely large universe are\nnot specifically related to modern physical cosmology but have been\ndiscussed since the early days of Christianity. On the other hand,\nthey may be seen as even more relevant today, when the favored\ncosmological model has zero curvature, meaning that space is flat.\nAlthough a flat cosmic space does not necessarily imply an infinite\nuniverse, many cosmologists assume that the universe is indeed\nspatially infinite.\n\nThe theological implications of an infinite universe were discussed by\nthe church fathers and, in greater detail, by Johannes Philoponus in\nthe sixth century. Many of the arguments were of the same kind as\nthose used in the attempts to prove the impossibility of a temporal\ninfinity. At the time of the scientific revolution it was commonly\nassumed that physical space cannot be truly infinite, only\nindefinitely large. Infinity was seen as a divine attribute not to be\nfound elsewhere; to claim that nature is infinite would be to endow it\nwith divinity, a heretical view characteristic of pantheism. While the\ngenerally accepted view among theists was, and to some extent still\nis, that an infinite universe is philosophically absurd and\ntheologically heretical, there was no consensus on the issue. In fact,\nseveral Christian thinkers, from Descartes in the seventeenth century\nthrough Kant in the eighteenth to Edward Milne in the twentieth, have\nargued that an infinite universe is in better agreement with\nGod\u2019s will and omnipotence than a finite one. According to\nMilne, \u201cIt requires a more powerful God to create an infinite\nuniverse than a finite universe; it requires a greater God to leave\nroom for an infinity of opportunities for the play of evolution than\nto wind up a mechanism, once and for all\u201d (Milne 1948, 233). The\ncorrelation between finitism and theism, and infinitism and atheism,\nshould be seen as historically contingent rather than justified by\neither scientific or theological reasons.\n\nDuring the early period of modern cosmology, relativistic models with\nzero or negative curvature were sometimes associated with materialism\nand atheism because they implied a universe of infinite size.\nConversely, Einstein\u2019s closed and finite universe was welcomed\nby theists. According to Ernest W. Barnes, the mathematically trained\nbishop of Birmingham, infinite space was \u201ca scandal to human\nthought,\u201d (Barnes 1931, 598). His argument was epistemic as well\nas theological: only if God\u2019s universe is finite can we hope to\nunderstand the full range of his activity. Lema\u00eetre thought\nlikewise that the universe had to be finite in order to be\ncomprehensible. In agreement with his later warning against the\n\u201cnightmare of infinite space\u201d (Kragh 2004, 139), both of\nhis two innovative cosmological models, the expanding model of 1927\nand the big-bang model of 1931, were spatially closed. The\nsteady-state model of the 1950s was not only unpopular among\nChristians because of its lack of a cosmic creation, but also because\nit implied a homogeneous universe of infinite extent. According to\nStanley Jaki, a Benedictine priest and historian of science, the\ninfinite universe is a scientific cover-up for atheism. Mormons do not\nagree, though, for they need a universe which is infinite in both time\nand space.\n\nThe present consensus model of a geometrically flat accelerating\nuniverse is usually taken to imply an infinite cosmos. The general\nattitude of cosmologists is to ignore the troublesome philosophical\nproblems and speak of the infinite universe as just an indefinitely\nlarge one. They rarely reflect on the weird epistemic consequences of\nan actual infinity and even more rarely on the theological\nconsequences. Ellis is an exception to the rule. He and his\ncollaborators have argued forcefully against an infinite universe,\nsuggesting that the flat space of the consensus model is probably an\nabstraction that does not hold physically (Ellis, Kirchner and Stoeger\n2004). If the universe is really infinite and uniform it can be (and\nhas been) argued that there will be an infinity of identical copies of\nall human beings and indeed of everything. Such a consequence, as\ndiscussed by Ellis, Max Tegmark, Alan Guth and others, clearly is\ntheologically disturbing.\n\nEven more disturbing, says Ellis, is that God may then not be able to\nkeep track of and give attention to the infinite number of beings in\nthe universe. Moreover, if there is a multitude of cosmic regions,\neach of which is inhabited with intelligent beings, one may need to\ncontemplate a multitude of Christ-figures, incarnations and\ncrucifixions. Ellis was not only willing to consider such a scenario,\nhe also thought that it strengthened the case for a finite universe,\nfor then \u201cwe would have to countenance only a finite number of\ncivilizations needing redemption. Surely an infinite number of\nChrist-figures must be too much, no matter how one envisages\nGod\u201d (Ellis 1993, 394).\n7. Physical eschatology\n\nThe cosmological field equations are time-symmetric and the\nfundamental laws of physics are assumedly valid at any time. Thus,\nmodern cosmology is not only about the past of the universe, it also\noffers scenarios about its far future, including speculations about\nthe fate of intelligent life. Given that the apocalyptic passages in\nthe Bible speak of an end of the world and a possible new creation\n(e.g., 2 Peter 3:10\u201313), the cosmic future may seem to offer\nanother point of contact between cosmology and theistic religion. But\ncan there be a secular or scientific eschatology?\n\nScientifically based speculations about the state of the cosmos in the\nfar future and the possibility of endless life were first discussed in\nthe late nineteenth century in connection with the controversy over\nthe heat death predicted by the second law of thermodynamics. Some of\nthe German scientists involved in the controversy argued that life\nmight persist even in the very high-entropic environment of the far\nfuture, and they explicitly referred to the eschatological aspects of\ncosmology. Characteristically, while the heat death scenario was\nwelcomed by Christian authors, it was vehemently opposed by\nmaterialists and atheists who argued for an eternal universe with\neternal life. As Eddington, a Quaker and an advocate of the inevitable\nheat death, later asked: \u201cSince when has the teaching that\n\u2018 heaven and earth shall pass away\u2019 become\necclesiastically un-orthodox?\u201d (Eddington 1935, 59).\n\nSince the 1970s \u201cphysical eschatology\u201d has emerged as a\nnew subfield of astrophysics and cosmology, pioneered by Freeman\nDyson, Jamal Islam and others (see the survey in Kragh 2011,\n325\u2013353). The field deals primarily with the state of the\nuniverse in the remote future as based on extrapolations of\ncosmological models and the assumption that the presently known laws\nof physics will remain indefinitely valid. The favored scenario is the\nopen ever-expanding universe where extrapolations typically result in\nan ultimate future (at about 10100\nyears from now!) in which the universe consists of nothing but an\nexceedingly thin electron-positron plasma immersed in a cold radiation\nof neutrinos and photons. Other studies presume a closed universe\ncollapsing in a big crunch and others again investigate the nearer\nfuture of humankind, say a few million years from now. While many of\nthese studies are not concerned with the final state of life, some\nare, and it is this latter group that constitutes physical eschatology\nproper. According to John Barrow and Frank Tipler, the research field\nis, \u201cthe study of the survival and the behavior of life in the\nfar future\u201d (Barrow & Tipler 1986, 658).\n\nPhysical eschatologists usually ignore the religious associations of\ntheir studies or deny that they exist. Tipler is a controversial\nexception, however. Not only does he argue that some kind of life can\ncontinue forever in a closed universe, he also claims that it is the\nvery collapse of the universe that permits eternal life. When the\nfinal eternity has been reached at what he calls the \u201comega\npoint,\u201d life becomes omniscient and the temporal becomes\natemporal. According to Tipler, the final singularity is God and\n\u201ctheology is nothing but physical cosmology based on the\nassumption that life as a whole is immortal\u201d (Tipler 1995, 17).\nIn his book The Physics of Christianity (Tipler 2007), he\ncontinues his idiosyncratic exploration of modern cosmotheology\naccording to which theology is merely a branch of physics.\nTipler\u2019s views are undoubtedly extreme, but (and perhaps for\nthis reason) they have caused much discussion among theologians.\n\nThe term physical eschatology indicates a connection to biblical\neschatology, but it is far from clear that the two are related in any\nmeaningful sense. The message of the Bible is not so much the end of\nthe physical universe as it is about the imminent return of Christ,\nthe transformation of humans from flesh to spirit, and the final\nkingdom of God. It is about the ultimate destiny and goal of humans,\nnot of self-reproducing robots. As Jefferson Davis (1999) notes, the\nultimate hope which is crucial in theology cannot be supplied\nby the laws of physics. The scenario of a closed universe, such as\nargued by Tipler, may appear to be more compatible with the biblical\nview than the case of the ever-expanding universe, but even in the\nformer case it is hard to establish a meaningful connection. While the\nend of the world does not conflict with the Bible, the claims of\nimmortality of intelligent life forms (not necessarily humans) do. The\nBible says that God alone is immortal and that all his created beings\nare doomed to extinction unless God decides otherwise.\n\nSeveral theologians have expressed concern about the\ncosmologists\u2019 scenarios of the end of the universe and stressed\nthat there is a world of difference between these scenarios and proper\neschatology. According to Wolfhart Pannenberg the Christian\naffirmation of an imminent end of the world is scarcely reconcilable\nwith the cosmological extrapolations of the state of the universe\nzillions of years ahead. Karl Peters probably speaks for the majority\nof theologians when he writes: \u201cIf the expanding universe is\nindeed open, expanding forever, then how can one speak of God\nrecreating the universe? If the universe is closed, then it is likely\nto end in a \u2018big crunch\u2019 of mammoth black-hole\nproportions. Again, it is difficult to see how a new creation can take\nplace\u201d (Schwarz 2000, 180). According to Peters, the physical\nend of the universe would in effect imply the non-existence of God as\nunderstood in the Christian tradition. Whereas Pannenberg, Peters,\nArthur Peacocke and others tend to think that physical and Christian\neschatology are either contradictory or incommensurable, Craig has\ntaken a more reconcilable view. According to him, the\ncosmologists\u2019 versions of secular eschatology furnish grounds\nfor taking seriously the hypothesis of a transcendent creative and\nomnipotent agent. This agent may not be the classical God, but more\nlikely God in a panentheistic version.\n\nFinally, Robert Russell (2008) argues that the potential conflict\nmight be resolved by appealing to God\u2019s omnipotence and freedom\nto perform miracles: the future of the universe would have\nbeen what science predicts had God not decided to act at Easter and\nbring about, and will continue to bring about, the new creation. This\nview is allegedly not in conflict with science, but only with the\nphilosophical assumption that the events predicted by science must\nhappen, and this assumption Russell sees no reason to accept.\n8. Conclusions: Cosmology and God\n\nThe question, \u201cwhy does the universe exist?\u201d admits of\nanswers from traditional religions as well as from contemporary\ncosmological theories. However, according to Bede Rundle (2004),\nneither of these answers are needed, for philosophical analysis is\nsufficient to prove the existence of a physical universe. While some\nclaim that the scientific answer has superseded all theological\nanswers, others claim that the scientific answer reinforces the claim\nthat God created the universe. Indeed, the story of the interaction\nbetween scientific cosmology and theology is by no means a simple tale\nof a better theory replacing an inferior; nor a simple tale of the\nconvergence of diverse sources of knowledge. A naive or ideological\nreading of twentieth century cosmology might count big bang cosmology\nas providing new support for theism, and alternatives such as\nsteady-state cosmology as atheistic backlashes. (And of course, the\nwork of apologists such as W.L. Craig lends credence to this sort of\npicture.) But such a view misses many nuances, both in the historical\nrecord, as well as in the logical structure of these issues. From a\nhistorical point of view, there has been little correlation between\nreligious views of scientific cosmologists and their proposed\ncosmological models. From an epistemological point of view, there are\nnumerous obstacles to claiming that the big bang confirms the\nhypothesis that God exists. And from a metaphysical point of view,\nGod\u2019s hand is not manifest even in big bang models: these models\nhave no first state for God to create, and these models have no time\nfor God to exist in before the big bang.\n\nBy pointing out some of the subtleties in the relationship between\nscientific cosmology and theology, we do not intend to claim that the\ntwo are nonoverlapping magisteria (to borrow a phrase from Stephen Jay\nGould). To the contrary, contemporary cosmology is fascinating\nprecisely because it has such intricate logical relations with\ntraditional metaphysical and theological issues.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Ashtekar, A., 2009. \u201cLoop Quantum Cosmology: An\nOverview,\u201d <em>General Relativity and Gravitation</em>, 41:\n707\u2013741.", "Barnes, E., 1931. \u201cDiscussion on the Evolution of the\nUniverse,\u201d <em>Nature</em>, 128: 719\u2013722.", "Barrow, J. and F.
