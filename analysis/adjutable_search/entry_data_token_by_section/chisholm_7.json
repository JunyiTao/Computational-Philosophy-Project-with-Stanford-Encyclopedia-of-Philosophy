This\ncould be true even if no unicorn actually exists. But surely John is\nthinking about something. His mind is not simply a blank.\nSome philosophers have wanted to say in such a case that there is an\nobject \u2014 in fact, a unicorn \u2013 about which John is\nthinking, but that this object is one that has \u201cintentional\ninexistence\u201d. It exists merely as an object of thought. In\nPsychology from an Empirical Standpoint, Brentano said that\nevery psychical phenomenon is characterized by \u201cintentional\ninexistence\u201d. He went on to say that this intentional\ninexistence is \u201cexclusively peculiar to psychical phenomena. No\nphysical phenomenon shows anything similar\u201d.\n\nBrentano\u2019s Thesis not entirely clear, but its importance should\nbe obvious. Suppose that every psychological fact somehow involves\nsomething with intentional inexistence (however precisely this is to\nbe construed). Suppose that no physical fact involves a thing with\nintentional inexistence. Then it would follow that no psychological\nfact can be identified with a physical fact; one version of the\npsycho-physical identity theory would be false; physicalism of some\npopular varieties would be untenable.\n\nChisholm was fascinated by Brentano\u2019s Thesis. He published a\nseries of papers on the topic, starting in 1952 and carrying on until\nat least 1981. In his papers Chisholm formulated precise versions of\nBrentano\u2019s thesis. Each paper provoked critical reaction from\nother philosophers. Since in some cases the criticisms were cogent,\nChisholm was motivated to develop new and more ingenious versions of\nthe Thesis.\n\nTracing all the different ways in which Chisholm attempted to\nformulate Brentano\u2019s Thesis would require a book-length\ndiscussion. Instead, we here focus on one illustrative example. In\nChapter 11 of [PPS], Chisholm developed a version of Brentano\u2019s\nThesis that turned on the notion of an intentional sentence.\nHe identified three marks of intentionality. Any noncompound sentence\nthat manifested one of these marks would be identified as an\nintentional sentence. The first mark of intentionality recalls\nBrentano\u2019s idea of intentional inexistence. Consider the\nsentence \u2018John is thinking about the Loch Ness Monster\u2019.\nNeither this sentence nor its negation entails either that the Monster\nexists or that it does not exist. Any such simple declarative sentence\nis intentional.\n\nThe second mark of intentionality is closely related, but involves\nwhole propositional clauses rather than mere singular terms. Consider\nthe sentence \u2018John wonders whether there is a monster in Loch\nNess.\u2019 Neither this sentence nor its negation entails either\nthat there is a monster in Loch Ness or that there is not such a\nmonster. Any simple sentence that displays this feature is also\nintentional.\n\nThe third mark of intentionality involves the failure of\nsubstitutivity for coextensive singular terms. In fact Eisenhower was\nthe man who would succeed Truman as President of the United States.\nHowever, from the fact that we knew that Eisenhower was in command of\nthe Army, it does not follow that we knew that the man who would\nsucceed Truman was in command of the Army.\n\nThese three marks of intentionality apply only to noncompound\nsentences. A compound sentence counts as intentional if and only if\none of its components is intentional. Thus, \u2018if Parsifal sought\nthe Holy Grail, then he was a Christian\u2019 is intentional because\nits antecedent is intentional. The antecedent carries the first mark\nof intentionality because neither it nor its negation entails either\nthat the Holy Grail exists or that it does not exist.\n\nChisholm then says \u2014 somewhat cautiously \u2014 that a thesis\n\u201cresembling that of Brentano\u201d may be stated in this way:\nwe can express all of our beliefs about physical phenomena without the\nuse of intentional sentences; but when we describe psychological\nattitudes, then we must either use intentional sentences or else make\nuse of other terms that are not needed for the description of physical\nphenomena. In his discussion, it appears that when Chisholm speaks of\n\u2018terms that are not needed for the description of physical\nphenomena\u2019 he has in mind terms that are ultimately definable\nonly by the use of intentional sentences.\n\nChisholm recognizes that we sometimes use intentional sentences to\ndescribe nonpsychological facts. For example, consider the sentence\n\u2018This weapon, suitably placed, is capable of making it be the\ncase that Boston is destroyed.\u2019 Neither that sentence nor its\nnegation entails either that Boston is destroyed or that Boston is not\ndestroyed. So it carries the second mark of intentionality. But it\nseems not to be psychological. Chisholm claims that we can rephrase\nthe sentence nonintentionally: \u2018If this weapon were suitably\nplaced, then Boston would be destroyed.\u2019 This is a compound\nsentence. Reflection will reveal that neither component carries any of\nthe marks of intentionality. (The critic may wonder whether this reply\nis entirely satisfactory, since it may seem that the paraphrase does\nnot mean precisely what the original meant.)\n\nAnother difficult class of sentences involves statements of\nprobability. Consider this example cited by David Sanford: \u2018It\nis not probable that Providence will be hit by a comet in the\n21st Century\u2019. Neither this sentence nor its negation\nentails either that Providence will be hit or that it won\u2019t be\nhit; thus the sentence carries the second mark of intentionality. Yet\nit seems to be nonpsychological.\n\nAt the time of [PPS] Chisholm already recognized that this formulation\nof Brentano\u2019s Thesis was problematic. He mentioned\n\u2018sentences describing relations of comparison\u2019 as a\ndifficulty. Consider the sentence \u2018This lizard looks something\nlike the Loch Ness Monster\u2019. Neither that sentence nor its\nnegation entails either that the Loch Ness Monster exists or that it\ndoes not exist. Yet there seems to be nothing psychological about the\nstatement that the lizard looks something like the Monster.\n\nOver a period of more than thirty years, Chisholm formulated and\nreformulated Brentano\u2019s Thesis. Perhaps the most insightful\ndiscussion of his views and their connections can be found in David\nSanford\u2019s \u2018Chisholm on Brentano\u2019s Thesis\u2019. In\nreply to that essay, Chisholm said, \u2018Anyone who wants to\nunderstand what I have been up to in trying to formulate criteria of\nintentionality, should read Sanford\u2019s paper\u2019 ([LLP],\n215).\n",
