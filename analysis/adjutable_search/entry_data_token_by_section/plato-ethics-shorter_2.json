Virtue and its Ontology\n\n\u201cVirtue\u201d translates arete, which Socrates\u2019\ncontemporaries used of any sort of excellence that leads to success. A\nnumber of writers before Socrates had used the word and its associated\nvocabulary primarily in ethical contexts. But Socrates was probably\nthe first to identify ethical virtue with what is analogous in the\nsoul to health in the body.\n\nIn Socrates\u2019 usage, virtue is the ability to do what is right\nand resist doing what is wrong. As we learn especially from the\nCrito, Socrates holds that wrong actions harm a part of\none\u2019s self, which he identifies in other dialogues as the soul.\nBecause the soul is more important to us than the body, we should care\nabout nothing so much as virtue, and Socrates understands his role in\nAthens as that of shaming Athenians into taking this most important\nconcern seriously through the care of the soul (29e\u201330a).\n\nIn inquiring after the virtues, Socrates assumes that they have some\nstatus as entities, especially in Euthyphro and Hippies\nMajor. Some scholars have thought this assumption represented an\nearly theory of Platonic forms (Allen 1970; see also Prior 2013 and\nWoodruff 2019.\n\nThe principal virtues of interest to Socrates in this group of\ndialogues are courage (andreia), reverence or piety\n(eusebeia, to hosion), wisdom (sophia),\ntemperance or integrity (sophrosune), and justice\n(dikaiosune), all of which seem to be dependent on, and\nperhaps identical to, wisdom (sophia).\n\nThese dialogues raise two general questions about virtues that are\nimportant to ethical theory, one concerning instrumentality and\nanother concerning unity. They also raise a question about the analogy\nbetween virtue and expert knowledge (techne).\n",
